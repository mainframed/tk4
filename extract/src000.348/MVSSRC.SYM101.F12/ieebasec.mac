*        THIS MODULE DEFINES MASTER RESIDENT CORE FOR THE             *
*        VARIABLE MEMORY SYSTEM. MASTER RESIDENT CORE MAY             *
*        REFERENCED THROUGH USE OF THE MACRO, IEEBASEA.               *
*        ADDRESSABILITY SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED VIA THE CVT             *
*        MACRO FACILITY.                                              *
*                                                                     *
*        THE FIRST FULL WORD ENTRY IN RESIDENT CORE IS A              *
*        POINTER TO THE COMMAND SCHEDULING CHAIN LIST OR-             *
*        IGIN. THIS IS FOLLOWED BY THE EVENT CONTROL BLOCKS           *
*        FOR ADDED CHAIN ELEMENT AND IPL, PLUS POINTERS               *
*        TO Q, PROCLIB, AND LOG UCB'S. THE BALANCE OF RESI-           *
*        DENT CORE CONSISTS OF SEVERAL STATUS SWITCHES.               *
