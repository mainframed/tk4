Basic TCP/IP Support for TK4-
=============================

This archive contains the source updates necessary to support Jason Winter's
TCP/IP implementation on TK4-. The original source programs are taken from
Jason's JCC 1.50.00 distribution (see dataset TK4-.JASON.JCC on TK4-) and
from the dyn75l.zip archive, dated around 2009/2010, uploaded by Paul Edwards
to the hercules-390 Yahoo group (see dataset TK4-.JASON.DYN75L.ZIP on TK4-).

Note that this archive only contains programs that need updates to work with
TK4-. The source of programs working unmodified (namely EMAIL, FTPCMD, PORTS
and RESET) can be extracted directly from the JCC distribution. On TK4-, as a
convenience, the source of all programs running on MVS (FTPD plus the four
previously named ones) has been placed in JCC.TCPIP.SRC and JCC.TCPIP.INCLUDE
to make it easily accessible for review and local adaptions.

The programs tcpip.c and dyn75.c need to be integrated with Hercules to provide
the TCPIP instruction (opcode X'75'), which exposes the host system's IP stack
to the Hercules guest. TK4- Update 07 provides this integration for all host
operating systems supported by TK4-. As this is a TK4- specific implementation
no dynamic module (dyn75.dll/so/la) was built. Instead the programs are linked
into Hercules statically.

To integrate tcpip.c and dyn75.c into a Hercules system different from the one
that comes with TK4- the instructions given in newtcpip.txt (found in archive
TK4-.JASON.DYN75L.ZIP) should be followed closely. They line out how to modify
the Hercules build to make the TCPIP instruction available, which is beyond the
scope of this README.

This archive contains the following files and folders:

Folder ftpd_from_jcc_distribution:
----------------------------------
ftpd.c    -- original FTPD program from the JCC distribution. This file contains
             lots of tabs, trailing blanks and lines consisting of a single
             blank only which makes diff handling difficult after having edited
             it on MVS. Application of ftpd_from_jcc_distribution_cleanup.patch
             (in folder patches) removes those artefacts without changing the
             file's contents.

Folder new:
-----------
dyn75.c   \  programs from folder old after application of X75_for_TK4-.patch.
ftpd.c     > dyn75.c and tcpip.c are not 64-bit save, they are meant to be used
tcpip.c   /  with 32-bit Hercules versions only. ftpd.c is the the source for
             the MVS FTPD program as found also in JCC.TCPIP.SRC.

Folder new_64-bit:
------------------
dyn75.c   \  These are the 64-bit save versions of dyn75.c
tcpip.c   /  and tcpip.c.

Folder old:
-----------
dyn75.c   -- original dyn75.c program from TK4-.JASON.DYN75L.ZIP.
ftpd.c    -- original FTPD program _after_ application of
             ftpd_from_jcc_distribution_cleanup.patch.
tcpip.c   -- original tcpip.c program from TK4-.JASON.DYN75L.ZIP.

Folder patches:
---------------
X75_64-bit_for_TK4-.patch                 -- 32-bit to 64-bit updates.
X75_for_TK4-.patch                        -- TK4- compatibility updates.
ftpd_from_jcc_distribution_cleanup.patch  -- remove artefacts from ftpd.c.
