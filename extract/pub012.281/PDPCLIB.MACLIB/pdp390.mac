* Is the GCC or C/370 calling convention being used?
*
         GBLC &COMP               Declare compiler switch
*
* What system are the compiles being done for?
*
         GBLC &SYS                Declare variable for system
*
* Which OS are we targetting?
*
         GBLC &OS                 Declare compiler switch
*
* Are PUTs done in locate or move mode?
*
         GBLC &OUTM
*
*
*
&COMP    SETC 'GCC'               Indicate that this is for GCC
* &COMP    SETC 'C370'            Indicate that this is for C/370
&SYS     SETC 'S390'              Define either S370, S380 or S390
&OUTM    SETC 'M'                 Indicate move mode
* &OUTM    SETC 'L'               Indicate locate mode
&OS      SETC 'UNKNOWN'           Indicate that the OS is not known
* &OS      SETC 'MVS'             Indicate that this is for MVS
* &OS      SETC 'MUSIC'           Indicate that this is for MUSIC/SP
*
* The S/390 model (with code able to reside above the 16 MB line)
* has no AMODE/RMODE restrictions.
* Note that this option isn't available under CMS, which
* requires the executable to be RMODE 24 - even under z/VM.
*
         AMODE ANY
         RMODE ANY
