**     and supercede the general options. For non-SNA local devices  **
**     the terminal name is CRTnnnn (four digit device number for    **
**     newer systems, or 0 plus the UCB name for MVS).               **
**                                                                   **

*   Currently the language module is used only by the options
*   module, but that is subject to change.
*   Only the English language module is supplied, but feedback for
*   other languages is welcome.
LANGUAGE=USE                 U.S. ENGLISH (USE OR ENU)

*   Each options member may contain one level of indirection.
*   OPTLIB may point to a sequential library, a PDS with a member
*   name, or a PDS. For a PDS, options will be processed cumulatively
*   from member OPTIONS, a member name of the SMF id (if legal),
*   a member name of the SMF id with illegal characters replaced by
*   a pound sign # (octothorpe), the terminal id with an X wildcard
*   (CUU0xxx, CUU0cxx, CUU0crx, CUU0crt), and finally with the
*   user id, if one is available.
*   Note that options may be reprocessed using the OPTS LOAD command,
*   but some options have no effect because they are used only
*   at startup.
*PTLIB=HERC01.EXH.OPT        USER/TERMINAL OPTION PDS.

*   Exhibit displays a summary screen showing system activity.
*   For local terminals, this screen is usually updated every
*   five seconds. For remote terminals, a larger interval of thirty
*   to sixty seconds may be preferrable. E.g., use SWEEP=30
SWEEP=5                      1-120 SECONDS SCREEN UPDATE TIME

*   Some Exhibit commands have an option of updating the screen
*   until stopped by a PA1 key. This options sets the loop time.
*   Again, a larger value is recommended for remote terminals.
LOOP=5                       1-120 SECONDS LOOP UPDATE TIME

*   Exhibit uses a timer limiting how long a command response
*   is displayed. At expiration it reverts to the summary display.
*   The value is specified in seconds, or with MAX.
WAIT=YES                     1-655 SECONDS RESPONSE WAIT / YES=MAX

*   On larger terminals the summary screen has room for extra data,
*   displaying the date, time, SMF id, CPU busy, etc.
*   This (default) may be set by ZZID=YES or =NO
ZZON=ID                (old) DISPLAY ID LINE ON TOP OF MAIN SCREEN
ZZOFF=ID               (old) SKIP ID LINE ON TOP OF MAIN SCREEN
ZZID=YES           ALTERNATE DISPLAY ID LINE ON TOP OF MAIN SCREEN

*   Usually the largest space on the summary display is taken up
*   by the active task (DA) function. DAOFF and DAON allow
*   specification of which tasks are suppressed from the display.
*   (Due to a historicdally bad decision, this is backwards).
*   DAOFF specifies the task types not suppressed, i.e., displayed.
*   DAON  specifies types to be suppressed.
*   Options are: STC (start tasks), TSO (time-sharing tasks),
*   PRM (permanent STCs), IDLE (idle initiators), DRAIN (drained
*   initiators), INITS (all initiators), ALL (everything?),
*   and J2IO (JES2 active PCE counts, not DA but DQ - queue summary)
*   "Permanent" system tasks are ones assembled into module EXHDDA00,
*   starting with ALLOCAS. A name may be disabled by changing one byte
*   to an asterisk. Note that the list includes RACF, but not RAKF.
DAOFF=(STC,DRAIN)            DISPLAY START TASKS, DRAINED INITIATORS
DAON=J2IO                    SUPPRESS JES2 COUNTS

*   We used to have output only displays in the customer work area.
*   These may be defined with
* ATTENTION=NO     Ignore attention, enter, and function keys
ATTENTION=YES      (Default) respond to all interrupt keys

*   For terminals that support the Explicit Partition feature
*   (3180, 3290, BlueZone, ...)
*   set the preferred screen size from a table. This allows the
*   firmware to be set for a larger buffer than initially desired.
*   0-12*40   1-12*80   2-24*80   3-32*80   4-43*80   5-27*132
*   6-62*132  7-62*80   8-31*80   9-62*160   (A-F reserved;24*80)
EXPART=4                     Start as model 4

*   For terminals with two sizes, specify the size you wish to start
*   in. Supported are  S-small  L-large  C-card format (largest)
*   and D (default).
IMPART=L

*   Decide how you wih to handle terminal I/O errors:
*   DEFAULT/ABEND - terminate the Exhibit task with a dump.
*   DISCONN       - terminate without messages.
*   IGNORE        - retry every 60 seconds for intervention requests.
*   DELAY         - retry every 60 seconds for all errors.
IOERROR=DISCONN

*
*   There are three keywords related to security and accessability:
*
* LOGON=NO×YES     The default of LOGON=NO allows unprivileged users
*                    access to unprotected functions (e.g., initiator
*                    information, device lists and status).
*                    =YES requires a logon (either PAS or SIG) for all
*                    interactions.
* LOGON=SYS        is not usually defined in options, but flipped with
*                    the SET command. It restricts successful logons
*                    to users with SYStems privilege.
LOGON=NO

*
*   By default, a required logon uses the Exhibit PASsword method.
* SECURITY=NONE    Bypasses all checking; logons are optional.
* SECURITY=RACF    Requires SIGnon with a RACF/RAKF id. When the
*                    security is not active, all access is allowed.
*                    Unless the user belongs to a defined group, such
*                    as SYSnnn, OPERnnn, or CUSSnnn, privileges will
*                    be taken from the TSO privileges.
* SECURITY=TS      The logon is checked using the TSO data in SYS1.UADS
* SECURITY=RATS    Uses RACF/RAKF to check logon, but falls back to
*                    TSO when the security system is inactive.
SECURITY=RATS
*
* GAMES=YES×NO     Allows or inhibits access to games. Some have
*                    additional restrictions (e.g., in Adventure the
*                  cave is closed for cleaning during the first shift).
*
GAMES=YES

*  For users with multiple terminals of the same screen size and
*    display options, system overhead may be reduced by producing
*    the summary screen in only one task, and having the other
*    tasks just echo that screen.
*  The module also allows limited communication between tasks; e.g.,
*    issuing a MODIFY crt,QUIT to the primary (first started) Exhibit
*    task causes others to shut down when in summary display mode.
*  This is accompished by copying module EXHRDFLT to SYS1.LPALIB,
*    and specifying the suffix here:
GROUP=NONE                   Use the default member.

*  The function layout of the summary screen is determined by
*  pre-assembled "layout" modules. Each module specifies the layout
*  for three screen sizes:
*    EXHL-1920,  960,  480  (24*80,  12*80,  12*40);
*    EXHN-3440, 2720, 2560  (43*80,  35*80,  32*80);
*    EXHO-5676, 4620, 3564  (43*132, 35*132, 27*132);
*    EXHQ-9920, 4960, 4960  (62*160, 31*160, 62*80).
*  Source code for these modules is distributed in the USRC PDS.
LAYOUT=DFLT                  Defaults for each size.

*  In addition to the layout specification, each function
*  (DA-display active, DQ-display job queue counts, DR-display
*    pending replies, IR-display intervention requests,
*  MR-display mount requests, OF-display offline units,
*  ON-display online DASD, PA-display paging counts,
*  ZZ-mandatory last-displays screen) has a level value.
*  A level 0 function is invoked every sweep, a level 1 or 2 function
*    only every nth sweep. For OS/360, this was expedient because
*    the DQ function needed to do DASD I/O to get queue counts.
LEVEL1=1   DA
LEVEL2=1   IR,MR,OF,ON,PA
LEVEL3=2   DQ           Invoke once every ten seconds (SWEEP*LEVELn)

*  The summary screen has an option to invoke a user module, EXHDUSER,
*  on specified cycles:
ULEVEL=12                    Invoke once per minute (255-off)
UEXIT=NO                     YES or NO to invoke user exit

*  There are minor differences in terminal character sets. The
*  EXHT modules provide four translate tables per module:
*  output for data; output for control and data;
*  input in mixed case; input with upper case translate.
*  Supplied are: ATT8 (AT&T 3278 compatible), ITT8 (IT&T 3278/3179),
*  MRX7 (Memorex 3277), 1047 (supports brackets for 1047 code page),
*  and IBM terminals 3180, 3277, 3278, 3279.
*  Note that Graphics Escape may be used on output, but not with
*  these tables, and not on input.
TRANS=3279

*  Most terminals these days support color, but not equally well.
* --> NOTE THAT COLOR CODING IS SUPPORTED ONLY BY VTAM ATTACHED
* --> TERMINALS AT PRESENT.
*  The HWCOLOR option allows replacement of the intended color
*  (position 1-7) with another. For example, BLUE on some terminals
*  is hard to read, and CYAN provides a more readable display.
HWCOLOR=5234567              Replace BLUE by CYAN
HWCOLOR=1234567              No change

*  The SWCOLOR option allows assigning a color value to a Start Field
*  setting that otherwise has no color. The digits 0-7 are used
*  in the sequence corresponding to the low six bits of an SF order.
SFCOLOR=44445555777700004444555577770000

*  Subsequent definitions provide defaults that can be overridden
*    by relevant Exhibit commands.
*  Note that ad-hoc entries permit only a single data set name, with
*    an optional volume (if uncataloged), and no member name.
