.* DESCRIPTION    STANDARD IBM LINKAGE CODE IS GENERATED BY THE MACRO *
.*                TO RETURN CONTROL TO THE CALLING PROGRAM.  THE USER *
.*                MAY SPECIFY THE RETURN CODE TO BE RETURNED.         *
.*                RE-ENTRANT CODE IS SUPPORTED.                       *
.*                                                                    *
.*                REGISTERS 0 THROUGH 14 (OR OPTIONALLY, REGISTERS    *
.*                2 THROUGH 14) WILL BE RESTORED TO THEIR STATUS      *
.*                UPON ENTRY TO THE ROUTINE.  REGISTER 15 WILL BE     *
.*                USED FOR A DEFAULT OR USER SPECIFIED RETURN CODE.   *
.*                AN X'FF' WILL BE PLACED IN THE HIGH ORDER BYTE OF   *
.*                WORD 4 OF THE OLD SAVE AREA TO INDICATE THAT        *
.*                CONTROL HAS BEEN RETURNED TO THE CALLING PROGRAM    *
.*                                                                    *
.*                CODE IS ALSO GENERATED TO RESTORE THE PROGRAM MASK  *
.*                TO ITS STATUS UPON ENTRY TO THE ROUTINE.  THE       *
.*                VALUE OF THE MASK IS OBTAINED FROM THE HIGH ORDER   *
.*                BYTE OF REGISTER 14.  THE ASSUMPTION IS MADE THAT   *
.*                STANDARD LINKAGE WAS USED TO INVOKE THE ROUTINE,    *
.*                THAT IS, THAT ENTRY WAS MADE BY A  BALR  R14,R15.   *
.*                IF THIS IS NOT TRUE, THE PROGRAM MASK WILL BE       *
.*                RESTORED INCORRECTLY.  IF SPM=NO IS SPECIFIED, THE  *
.*                PROGRAM MASK WILL NOT BE ALTERED.                   *
