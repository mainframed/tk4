A brief history of the EXHIBIT package.

When IBM first announced the 2260 CRTs, I was working for Applied Data
Research Inc. in their Virginia office, supporting their service
bureau, and working on programming projects (mostly scientific or
plotting). After some years the office leased a 360/40, and four 2311
disks, and management wanted the programming staff to become familiar
with it, and allowed almost unrestricted use (except when customers
were running - PCP initially, then MFT).

One of our customers wanted to program for 2260s, so we leased a four
CRT assembly (I don't recall having a printer). After some prompting,
our manager said we could use them whenever the customer wasn't.
At the time we were running MFT, and the operators had a difficult time
keeping track of the partitions, and what jobs were running, and what
could be running, but wasn't. Also at that time ADR signed a contract
with the CIA to convert a batch word processing program to interactive
CRT use, for multiple concurrent users. As part of the contract I was
allowed to use our system, and CRTs, rather than working at the CIA,
with restrictions on test time. At the time, MFT did not support the
ATTACH service, so I had to improvise, with my own enqueue facility,
and other improvisations needed to support multiple CRTs and users.

When I finished that contract, I had a lot of MFT knowledge, and spare
time. I decided to write a program to display system information on
a 2260, to make things easier for the operators and systems staff.
The basic display showed partition information, running jobs, and job
classes for idle partitions. The program was later expanded to include
counts, by class, of waiting jobs, counts of jobs awaiting output, and
later was expanded again to include unit and message information.
At the time the minimum partition size was 12K, and the design was for
4K programs, with a 4K data area. My manager suggested selling it, but
strictly low-key. We got a free ad, selling the 2260 MONITOR package
for $35, in card form. Some time later I got a nice letter asking
whether I could add some on-demand displays; the writer was primarily
interested in a storage display.

Due to limitations of the storage manager, I was unable to get three
4K blocks into a 12K area. Eight bytes were needed by the system at the
end of the partition, so the work area was changed to 4K-8 to fit.
The timed wait (5 seconds) after each display update was modified to
test for a user attention, that triggered an XCTL to a conversational
module. At the time DUMP was the only command, but soon thereafter I
got more ideas, and more suggestions. The available commands expanded
to include a TCB display, ALTer storage, and a partial data set display
limited to small blocks and available storage. The office was
moderately successful, and upgraded to a 360/50 running MVS. The
minimum region was 16K, and I finally could read an entire 2314
block!

ADR downsized the Virginia office to sales only, and I was without
a mainframe for a couple of years. One of my prior managers asked me
to work for him at American Management Systems, where there was a small
mainframe and 3270s. The program was renamed to EXHIBIT, and adapted
for the new CRTs. The 2260 buffer required a one byte control (line
number), and the rest of the screen was a simple one-to-one mapping.
Much of the Exhibit code still relies on this, although programs have
been written to support color and varying screen sizes. I did not want
to waste a display line on an input field, so instead adopted the
convention of allowing inout after a prompt, but stopping at the
curssor position. This takes a while to get used to; later programs
and rewrites support a dedicated title and input area.

AMS ran a modified RAND version of Wylbur, and had a number of
asynchronous terminals, mostly dual-case TTY compatibles. So I added
an interface to support TTY (and later NTO) terminals. These operate
by converting the screen image to discrete lines, followed by the
prompt.

At this time some programs have both a screen and line version, some
are CRT only, and some haven't been converted yet. It's very much
a work in progress.

Some years ago I wound up on a consulting contract at an IVP running
OS/390.  So I started converting the code from MVT, but never finished.
Only the most critical programs were converted.  A few years later I
retired, and found Hercules (almost by accident, and only after
discarding old manuals).  I started with the turnkey-3 CD from Volker
Bandke, and had to convert the OS/390 version back to MVS.  All the VTAM
code was written for ACF/VTAM, and that code hasn't been fixed for
pre-ACF VTAM yet.

The package is assembler oriented, using conditional assembly to
accommodate different system releases (although MFT has been mostly
dropped, and MVT uses S/370 opcodes available on Hercules), and
options. Work has begun converting the option modules to a text
data set or member, using 71 columns, but it is not yet complete.
Please read the installation instructions carefully to make sure
you get satisfactory results.
