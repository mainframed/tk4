FINI     TITLE 'FORTRAN VS INITIALIZATION ROUTINE'
*        THIS MODULE IS SUGGESTED BY IBM APAR II01635
*
*        FORTRAN SUBROUTINES MAY BE USED FROM A NON-FORTRAN
*        ENVIRONMENT ONLY IF THE FORTRAN CONTROL CODE IS
*        INITIALIZED (SEE FORTRAN APPLICATION PROGRAMMING
*        GUIDE SC26-3985).
*
*        THIS CODE IS PROVIDED TO HANDLE THE INITIALIZATION
*        NOTE THAT THE IBM CODE IS NOT USED DUE TO UNNECESSARY
*        COMPLEXITY.
*        NOTE THAT COMMON ENTRY FOR VS FORTRAN IS VSCOM#
*        THIS ROUTINE USES IBCOM# FOR FORTRAN E, G AND H COMPATIBILITY
