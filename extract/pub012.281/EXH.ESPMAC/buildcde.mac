.*        IF GETMAIN SPECIFIES A NON-ZERO SUBPOOL, THE DELETE MACRO   *
.*        DELETES THE CDE BUT DOES NOT FREE UP THE STORAGE:  YOU      *
.*        MUST ISSUE FREEMAIN YOURSELF.                               *
.*                                                                    *
.*        IN A MAJOR CDE CREATED BY THE "LOADER" FORM OF IDENTIFY,    *
.*        THE "RENT" AND "REUS" ATTRIBUTES ARE OFF.  THIS MEANS       *
.*        THAT YOU MAY NOT ISSUE LOAD AGAINST THE EP NAME (BUILDCDE   *
.*        HAS ALREADY ISSUED LOAD), BUT YOU MAY ISSUE LINK, ATTACH    *
.*        OR XCTL IF YOU WANT TO (ONCE ONLY).  YOU MAY ALSO ISSUE     *
.*        THE STANDARD FORM OF IDENTIFY TO DEFINE SECONDARY ENTRY     *
.*        POINTS WHICH HAVE THE "RENT" ATTRIBUTE.                     *

.*        IF THIS MACRO IS USED BY AN AUTHORIZED PROGRAM, THEN        *
.*        A S306 ABEND WILL OCCUR (THE CDE CREATED HAS ITS CDSYSLIB   *
.*        BIT OFF).  LOOK FOR A SECOND VERSION OF THE MACRO THAT MAY  *
.*        BE USED IN AN AUTHORIZED PROGRAM AT THE END OF THIS JOB.    *
.*                                                                    *
.*        THE IDENTIFY MACRO SUPPLIED IN SYS1.MACLIB SUPPORTS THE     *
.*        "LOADER" FORM, BUT THE FORMAT OF THE PARAMETER LIST IS      *
.*        NOT DOCUMENTED, AS FAR AS I KNOW.  THE RETURN CODES X'18'   *
.*        OR X'1C' MAY BE RETURNED IN R15 WHEN THE PARAMETER LIST     *
.*        IS INVALID.  THESE RETURN CODES ARE DOCUMENTED ALONG WITH   *
.*        THE IDENTIFY MACRO.                                         *
.*                                                                    *
.*        WHEN THE LOAD-LIST IS EMPTY (I.E. NO LOAD HAS BEEN ISSUED   *
.*        FOR THIS TCB YET), IDENTIFY FAILS WITH A RETURN CODE 12.    *
.*        THIS CAN BE CIRCUMVENTED BY ISSUING THE FOLLOWING SEQUENCE: *
.*                                                                    *

.*        I'VE NOTICED THAT ON MVS SYSTEMS PRIOR TO MVS/ESA 4.3, THE  *
.*        "LOADER" FORM OF IDENTIFY RETURNS THE ADDRESS OF THE CDE IT *
.*        CREATED IN REG1.  IN MVS/ESA 4.3 THIS IS NO LONGER TRUE.    *
.*                                                                    *

.*        BY DEFAULT, BUILDCDE USES THE GETMAINED AREA TO BUILD THE   *
.*          IDENTIFY LIST. IF YOU USE THIS AREA BETWEEN THE GETMAIN   *
.*          AND BUILDCDE (E.G., SAVE AREA, OR INIT TO ZERO) THEN      *
.*          USE LIST= FOR AN ALTERNATE LIST ADDRESS. FOR EXAMPLE,     *
.*          TRY LIST=20(R13) - USE ANY RS FORMAT ADDRESS LENGTH 32    *
