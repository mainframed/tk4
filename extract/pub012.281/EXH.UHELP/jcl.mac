JCL member × mask ª ,nth ³

The JCL program searches for the specified member in all libraries
specified in the OPTions data set under the ªJCLLIB³ group. When the
member is found, a UPD display is invoked.

The request may use a mask, using ? as a single character match, and *
as a terminal match. JCL ???SAMP, assuming SYS1.SAMPLIB is in
the library list, would return COBSAMP
The optional "nth" value is an integer asking to retrieve the nth
occurrence of a match. So JCL ???SAMP,2 would retrieve GSPSAMP
