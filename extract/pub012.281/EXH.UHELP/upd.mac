UPD pdsname(member)

UPDate is a (misnamed) version of @UPDATE. It provides display of data
set information, but updating is inhibited. While scrolling up
and down is supported, it stops at block boundaries. To get to a
later block, hit enter; to get an earlier block, use TTR= to
position. F 'text' will position to a later occurring match. TOP will
start over.
