LOOP text

The LOOP command causes automatic screen updating for most
functions.
The exact four letters LOOP set input mode; any remaining text
is then processed as normal input.
When the requested function executes normally, the message LOOP
is issued in place of MORE ? If no input is issued during the
wait period, then an ENTER is simulated; this normally results
in a new page of information. An ENTER issued during this
interval triggers off the next page immediately, any other
response is processed as input and results in cancellation of
LOOP mode. Note that some functions will simulate LOOP mode
(e.g. BUMP), while others will not accept LOOP mode at all.
Still others will retain LOOP mode even if input is issued,
e.g. TCB will retain LOOP mode if an ampersand is entered.

Note that some functions allow the verb LOOP as part of their
normal operands; in general a LOOP specified after the verb
will act in a different fashion from the LOOP mode described
here.

The default LOOP interval is 3 seconds for a Started EXHIBIT
task, is 10 seconds under TSO, and may be set/reset (using the
SET command) to any value in the range of 3 to 655 seconds.
