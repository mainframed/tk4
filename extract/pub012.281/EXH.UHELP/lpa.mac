LPA < name × mask × A=hexaddr >

This program displays Link Pack Area information.

The display lists for each entry :
Location (FLPA, MLPA or PLPA)
Module name preceded by an * for an alias entry
Entry point address
Start address of module (loaded address)
Module length in hex
Use count
Responsibility count; minimum is 1 to keep module loaded
Attributes assigned by Linkage Editor (RENT+REUS are shown as
RENT only).

Either a module name, or a mask may be specified to locate
specific entries. For PLPA, a mask value is not recommended if
a name could be used instead.
The form LPA A=hexaddr may be used to locate LPA members
located at or near the specified address. This form may also
be used to locate ALIAS entries for modules; a request for LPA
IGG0190S would return an ENTRY and a START address. A
subsequent LPA A= with either address would then redisplay
IGG0190S, and the module it is an alias of.

Note that OS does not have an MLPA. Modules so displayed are
ALIAS entries (not made resident at IPL time), which were made
resident at IPL time under another name.

Following an LPA request, an ENTER will continue to the next
page or restart the display. Input of a period alone will
enter the REP command, using the START address of the first
displayed module as a BASE.
