PFK < cuu >
DPFK < cuu >

The PFK command displays the first or specified OS DIDOCS Console's
Program Function Key assignments. By default, assignments for the
first console with PFK entries will be displayed; else the "cuu"
operand may be used to specify the hardware address of the console
for which the display is to be made.

Error messages will be issued if no function key assignments are found
for any or the specified console.

The display shows, for each assigned key, the key number, the mode
(CON=Y means the command will be displayed for possible alteration
prior to execution, CON=N that it will be executed immediately),
and either (unquoted) other keys to be invoked by that one, or
(quoted) the text of the command(s) corresponding to that key.
