$F <Job=name×prefix> <Form=nnnn> <Remote=nnn × RMT=nnnn>

The $F function displays the JES2 Forms Queue. The beginning of each
line shows the form, UCS, and FCB, then the Q. The remainder of
each line will show, by priority, the JES2 job name, status (* if
the job is held, # if the job is executing, and ? if the job is
executing and held, else -), the job name and the record count.
