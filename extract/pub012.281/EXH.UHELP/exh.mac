EXH

Exhibit may run as a multi-user task under VTAM. This command, for a
VTAM session, shows the addresses of the MTS and MTV control
blocks, the user id, and other data.

In a non-multitasking environment the program displays credits.

When the invoking command is longer than EXH, it's assumed to be a
mistake - that the user meant to hit PF3 ($JOB) rather than ENTER,
and the request is rerouted accordingly.
