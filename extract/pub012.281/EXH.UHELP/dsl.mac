DSN serves as a router. It looks at the RECFM of the data set and
routes the request to the appropriate processor: DSL for F, DSV for
V, DSU (read only ZAP display), or DSW for Wylbur compressed
data.

On a system with RAC active, access will be checked (user sign-on is
required).

DASD displays disk data set contents in hexadecimal.
DISK displays in both EBCDIC and hexadecimal.
DSL displays mixed case (upper on a terminal without lower case).
DSU displays upper case EBCDIC data.
DSV displays V format print files (LRECL<150).
DSW displays WYLBUR compressed data sets.

Input data blocks are truncated to fit available storage, hence
blocks exceeding the available size (approx. Region - 9K) will
not be shown in full.

"dsname" is mandatory, the DSN= preceding it is optional. The data set
name may be specified as in SUPERZAP (xMASPZAP) to access a VTOC.
If the first byte of the DSName supplied is an ampersand, it
will be replaced by the index "SYS1."; for instance DSN=&PROCLIB
would be replaced by DSN=SYS1.PROCLIB.

The CCHH values may be used in place of the "dsname" to retrieve data
anywhere on a volume. The "volser" must be used.

The form "*.ddname" may be used to access a data set defined in the
TIOT of the current task (e.g. *.STEPLIB).

The member name (in either form) is optional; it allows display to
start with the indicated member. The operand must not be used
unless the data set is a PDS; if the data set is a PDS and the
operand is not used, then the directory will be displayed. If both a
member name and a "hexttr" are supplied, then the TTR applies to the
directory, not to the member. Refer also to the PDS command for member
mask and I/O error message information.

VOL=volser specifies the disk from which the data set is to be read.
It is optional if the data set is cataloged on the volume to be
searched, or if the "*.ddname" form is used.

When the MEMBER operand is not used, then TTR= may be used to start
data retrieval at other than the first record. The "hexttr" value
is treated the same as "ttr" in NOTE, POINT, and BDAM READ/WRITE
Macros.

Following display of a full screen, an ENTER will continue formatting;
an ampersand will skip to the next block. A TTR=hexttr may be
used to start at another block. Following an EOF or Error message,
the TTR= option is the only reply which will allow a continued
display; any other response will be interpreted as discrete command
input.
