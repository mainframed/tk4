SCR DSN=dsname, VOL=<type=>volser <,PURGE> <,UNCAT> < ,EVEN >

SCRatch is a privileged function, requiring UNLOCK, to delete disk
data sets. Input parameters may be specified in any order,
optionally separated by blanks.

The "dsname" may not contain special characters, nor may it be
surrounded by quotes.

The "volser" specifies the disk from which the data set is to be
deleted; the "type=" parameter is optional and may be used to specify
the device type, e.g. 2314, 2311, 3330, etc.

You may specify VOL=CAT or VOL=CATLG to request a cataloged data set.
The data set and volume will be displayed with the PURGE message
for verification prior to deletion. UNCAT must be specified
separately if desired; it is not forced by =CAT.

PURGE will override expiration date checking.
UNCAT will uncatalog the data set after a successful scratch.

If PURGE is omitted, and either Expiration or Creation date have not
passed, the message "EXPIRATION DATE PROTECTED" will be issued. Only
the exact reply of PURGE without leading blanks will then proceed
with the scratch.

A password protected data set will cause the appropriate message to be
displayed, followed by a PURGE prompt (KEY mode only).

If you are certain you know what you want, you may specify
    DSN=data.set.name,EVEN - for this form, all prompts are bypassed,
and the data set will be scratched even if it has an unexpired or
special expiration date, or is protected. This form may also be used
to uncatalog a data set pointing to a non-existent volume.

After a successful scratch, another request with similar parameters
may be entered in short form by specification of the altered
parameter only; e.g. to scratch two data sets on the same volume, the
second one would require input of DSN=name only; to scratch a
multi-volume data set, supply only VOL=volser for the next volume, etc.
PURGE and UNCAT may be added on a subsidiary request, but cannot be
negated.
