@EDIT ...all parameters valid on @ZAP

Full-screen editing is invoked either with the major command @EDIT
(with normal data set operands as on @ZAP), or from the @ZAP
command with the EDIT subcommand.

In EDIT mode, the top lines of the screen show the current mode, data
set name and position, error messages, and a short input area.
The remaining lines are formatted as in the normal @ZAP display,
except that all hex fields are unlocked and may be modified by
direct replacement. The INSERT and DELETE keys may not be used. If
any ERASE keys are hit, the CLEAR key will restore the screen.
Entry of a non-hex digit will result in redisplay of the screen
without update of the current and subsequent fields, and an error
message. Hex digits may be entered in lower case.

Three options are available - a command may be entered in the short
command field, and ENTER hit. The command is executed either by the
EDIT routine or one of the @ZAP functions. For a @ZAP subcommand,
the response will be a normal @ZAP display. EDIT is re-entered by
hitting ENTER or typing EDIT.

Alternatively, data may be replaced in the text area. Place the cursor i
the text area and hit ENTER. The screen colors change. Type the
replacement text over the old text. An ENTER will replace the data in th
buffer (a ZAP command is required to rewrite modifications to disk).
ENTER, when no modifications are made and no command is issued,
advances to the next page or block, unless ZAP was not used after a
replace. In this case a warning message is issued instead of advancing
to the next block. When both the command and text area are
modified, the command entry is ignored.

Several of the PA and PF keys may be used. PA1 and PA2 (Cancel)
terminate the @ZAP/@EDI function without ZAP. CLEAR, unlike its
definition for @ZAP, rewrites the current screen; it does not REREAD.
The Test-Request key issues a LOCATE command if a prior LOCATE
has been issued. The command field may be used to add requests to
the locate; e.g. SCAN=XYZ in the command area with Test-Request
issues a LOC SCAN=XYZ command. The PF keys all process modified
text; PFK12 returns the cursor to the command area. PFK1 advances
the display one line, PFK2 three lines, and PFK3 ten lines. PFK4
backspaces one line, PFK5 three lines, and PFK6 ten lines. Spacing takes
place in the current block only, and does not result in loss of
unZAPped data. Other PFKs are not defined, and will not cause loss of
data.

Modes:

Key and Data mode are as defined for @ZAP, and cause the
appropriate data to be displayed in the text area. Key includes the
block's key in the display and modification, Data does not.

When the block is too large to fit in the Exhibit region, it
cannot be rewritten. In this case EDIT displays the text in
intensified mode. No modification is allowed.

EDIT mode, but not @ZAP, is cancelled by the OFF subcommand from
an EDIT display, or by EDIT OFF in @ZAP displays. When both EDIT
and UPDATE are specified and in effect, EDIT is invoked. The OFF
subcommand cancels only the current mode, not both.
