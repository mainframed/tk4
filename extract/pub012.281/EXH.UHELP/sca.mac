The scan commands search for text strings in a sequential or
partitioned data set. The @SCAN variation also permits replacement of
strings using update in place.

Search text is supplied with FIND followed by a quoted string, or an
unquoted word.
When replacement is permitted, REPlace similarly specifies a find and
a replacement string of equal length.

The search may be restricted by specifying search columns with
  MARGIN start end
For a PDS,   SCOPE start end   may specify a limiting range of member
names.

Note that the search is done in mixed case buy default; specify UPPER
to compare in upper case.

One of three commands triggers the search. SUM displayes only the
member names in which matches were found, or replacements made.
BRIEF displays only the first five mtaches per member, and GO
displays all matches. Note that replacements will show the original
and the altered text.
