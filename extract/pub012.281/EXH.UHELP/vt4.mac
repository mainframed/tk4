VT4

The VT4 function searches through all DASD and reports any having a
discrepancy between the format 4 DSCB and the system Device
Characteristics Table. Compared are track capacity constants, number of
per track, and number of directory blocks per track. Several
versions of systems distributed to run under Hercules (notably MVS
3.8, and its turnkey distributions) have bad packs.

Erroneous values are shown in red, field offsets in yellow, and
corrected values in green. Note that it is NOT recommended to zap these
values, as that may render the VTOC and some PDSs unusable. The
recommended procedure is to copy individual data sets off the bad packs
unto good ones, and then reformating the erroneous ones. IEH
utilities have not been tried, and may not work as expected; IEB
utilities have been used successfully.
