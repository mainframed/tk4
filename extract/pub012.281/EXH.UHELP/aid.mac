AID

The AID module is invoked without arguments (any present are ignored).
The function is available on full-screen CRTs only. The display
shows basic 3270 referenece data (AID values, CCW codes, orders,
and attributes).

The screen has four input fields. The third line is set to the device
geometry, and defaults to the current settings. These may be overtyped
as needed.

The input field on line four accepts four hex characters to be
converted from a buffer address to a row/column value. Note that values
on lines four and five are relative to an origin of 1,1.

The fifth line accepts two input fields, being the row and column
value for which a buffer address is desired. The module handles 12,
14, and 16 bit addresses, depending on buffer size.
