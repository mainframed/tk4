SCV <VOL=>volser <,DSN=mask> <,DATE> <.op.> <yyddd>
SCV <VOL=>volser <,DSN=mask> <,DATE> <.op.> <ccyyddd>

The SCratch Volume function permits scratching of multiple data sets
by displaying a full screen of data set names, and scratching
those flagged by the user.

VOL=volser The volume serial is mandatory, and specifies the
volume to be processed.

DSN=mask specifies a mask to be used for data set retrieval. The
value may be a prefix, or may contain embedded quotes
(") for general match characters.

DATE the DATE options cause high-lighting of data set entries
whose creation or expiration dates match the request.
DATE used without other operands checks for equality with
the current date. .op. specifies the test operation. Valid are = ^ ^=
< <= > >=

yyddd 5 or 7 digit number to be compared. If omitted, the current
date is used.

The function may be invoked by unauthorized users. In this case the
flag fields will be protected, and data sets will not be
scratched. For users with some privilege levels, non-scratchable data
sets will show a reason (p - password protected; r - racf
protected; or a minus sign - not allowed to scratch or the name contains
undisplayable characters). An 'e' indicates the data set is unexpired.
Warning flags are high-lighted.

For a normal display, Enter-only will advance to the next screen of
data sets.

To request a scratch operation, place an 'x' in front of the data set.
When any flag field on the screen has been changed, the screen is
redisplayed with a VERIFY message. Enter-only will not advance the page
in this mode. Three alternatives are available :

1) Use the Clear key to reset the page (reverts to normal display
mode) 2) Change additional flag fields. 3) Enter ZAP into the
command area to execute the scratch requests.
