BROWSE { data set name { ,serial }}

This is a preliminary implementation of the BROWSE module from ETPS,
written by Bill Godfrey, Wayne Mitchell, and Brian Cook, with mods
for Exhibit use, and some fixes.
The display offers self-explanatory (?) menus, but not all features
are implemented (e.g., missing Catalog display).
