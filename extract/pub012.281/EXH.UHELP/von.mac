VON ALL × cuu, ...

This command, valid only from an Operator's CRT, will Vary
ONline ALL but selected disks.
VON ALL varies all off-line disks online (except 2321).
If one or more disks are to be left off-line, they are
specified individually by hardware address on the VON command.
Group selections may be made by replacing one or two characters
in the address by an X.

Examples :
To vary online all disks other than 110 and 257, specify :
VON 110 257 (Either blank or comma may separate entries)
To vary online all disks other than on channel one and the 250
bank (250-25F), specify :
VON 1XX, 25X

The addresses of all disks varied or the word "NONE" shows the
result of a valid request. Syntactically invalid input is
failed with an "INVALID OP" message. Addresses which are
specified with correct hex characters but which do not exist in
the system are ignored.
