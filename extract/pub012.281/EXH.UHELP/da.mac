Display Active tasks - (DA)

This module displays active task information, sorted by start
identifier (shown as "id"). If insufficient space is available to
display all tasks, then only the highest tasks in the Address Space
Vector Table are displayed. Note that tasks in the process of being
started are not displayed until they acquire a region and initialize
the control blocks needed by EXHIBIT.
In the examples below, lower case letters denote variable information,
upper case items will be displayed exactly as shown.
                ×id       WAITING FOR JOB CLASS abcdefgh ×
                +----------------------------------------+
                ×I4       WAITING FOR JOB CLASS EF       ×
                +----------------------------------------+
An Initiator is waiting for jobs; if there are jobs in the system,
check the classes and Queue Hold status. Also note later
description of variant "Waiting" message with JES2.
                ×id   hloc nnnK jobname stepname     time×
                +----------------------------------------+
                ×I1   0458 130K BIGJOB FORTGCLG GO 93:46 ×
                +----------------------------------------+
Initiator "id" is running a job. "hloc" is the hex starting region
address (of the largest or only region), less the trailing two
zeroes, e.g. address 045800 is displayed as 0458. "nnnK" is the
amount of storage in the largest region. The time field is in
minutes:seconds of Job CPU time (at your installation's option may show
time). The time field is divided by a ^ sign if the task is
non-dispatchable, by an * if the job is in a WAIT state; in VS a # indic
non- dispatchability due to high system paging rates.
     ×id   jobname  ABENDED S xxx USER nnnn   ×
     +----------------------------------------+
     ×I5   BADJOB   ABENDED S 722 USER    0   ×
     +----------------------------------------+
The current task or its Initiator is abending. If the displayed task
is a Writer, then the Abend may be normal (sort of).
     ×id   hloc nnnK SCHEDULING JOB jobname   ×
     +----------------------------------------+
     ×I3   01E0  80K SCHEDULING JOB TAPESORT  ×
     +----------------------------------------+
Initiator is processing a job. The processing may be active; or it may
represent a Wait state, usually accompanied by a pending reply or a
console message, or the job may be ENQueued on a resource.
     ×id   hloc nnnK taskname ucb  classes    ×
     +----------------------------------------+
     ×W2   0680  16K WTR     01E *C           ×
     +----------------------------------------+
This display represents an Operator Started Task. "ucb" is the device
address used by the task (shown only if the IEFRDER DD Card is the
first card in the Procedure). For an OS Writer the output classes
are also shown when available; classes are preceded by an * if
the Writer is waiting for work.
        TSO Region Display
     ×TSxx yyyK   zzz USERS    userid   mmm:nn×
     +----------------------------------------+
     ×TS 1 196K     3 USERS    BIGUSER    4:58×
     +----------------------------------------+
In a TSO system, an additional line is displayed for each active
region. TSxx indicates the Time Sharing region number, "yyyK" the
region available to the user, "zzz USERS" the number of users logged
on. For a user currently swapped in, the Userid and CPU time are
displayed if available.

    JES2 Remote Line Status
     +----------------------------------------+
     ×LINES INACTIVE                          ×
     +----------------------------------------+
    all lines are disabled or drained.
     ×LINE fg/nn fg/nn fg/nn . . .            ×
     +----------------------------------------+
     ×LINE 1 *2 $3                            ×
     +----------------------------------------+
    status:  line number only - line is active/enabled.
             *line - line is drained
             $line - line is enabled, but a $P (Stop)
                       command is pending.
             omitted - line enabled, no terminal signed on.

JES2 Initiator Status
The basic WAITING FOR WORK message may be replaced if JES2 information
is available.

     ×Inn     WAITING;         CLASS classes  ×
     +----------------------------------------+
     ×I 5     status           CLASS classes  ×
     +----------------------------------------+
where "status" may be one of the following:
    "DRAINING" - a $P/PI command has been issued for this Initiator
(or all); a job is still active.
    "DRAINED" - this particular Initiator (or all of them) has been
stopped with a $PI command.
