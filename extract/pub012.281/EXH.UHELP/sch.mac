SCH { debug }

The SCHedule command displays the records for Dave Cole's scheduling
facility. The data set name is specified in the ªSCHEDULE³ section. If
none, the routine uses SYS2.SCHEDULE.

An SCH command, without operands, displays one entry per line. SCH
with any non-blank additionally produces debugging data.
