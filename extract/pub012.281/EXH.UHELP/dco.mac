DCON

Display CONsoles formats information similar to the D CONSOLES command
for OS; refer to the Messages and Codes manual message IEE250I
for detailed information.

Note: this module was copied from IBM code, but contains one change.
If an unavailable device erroneously exists in the UCM then
EXHIBIT will display the device address as ???

Preceding the first console entry, DCON will format the number of
Write Queue Elements and the number of Operator Reply Elements in
use and supported. Note that the WQE count may exceed the
"maximum". For each console, the number of unprocessed WQEs is shown
also. If a console is also receiving the HARDCOPY output, the
hardcopy messages count will appear twice.
