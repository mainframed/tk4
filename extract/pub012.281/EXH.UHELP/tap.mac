DEBE ucb <,NOENQ>
TAPE ucb <,NOENQ>

DEBE consists of a number of tape functions. It is permitted only from
CRTs defined as Operator CRTs that have been unlocked with the
UNL, PAS or KEY commands.

"ucb" specifies the unit name (e.g., 480) of a tape drive. This drive
must be unallocated, and it must be unused or may have a tape
mounted on it (MOUNT command). Unless a prior MOUNT was issued, any
ready tape will be unloaded from the drive.

To prevent inadvertent errors, DEBE serializes on the allocation
resource SYSIEFSD/Q4. The request is rejected if allocation is in
progress, unless the user has systems privileges and has used the NOENQ
operand (this is not recommended, but may be necessary if an
initiator is waiting for a tape which must be labelled using another
drive).

The available commands are displayed when the function is first used.
HELP will repeat the command list.

        HELP - lists these options.
        END or EOJ - terminates the program; any ready tape is first
             unloaded unless it was previously MOUNTed.
        attention during command - terminates the current command,
             halts data transfer, but does not stop tape motion.
        RUN - rewinds and unloads a tape; this cancels MOUNT status.
        REW - rewinds a tape.
        DEN xxxx - sets mode and density; this command must be used
             before destructive requests (WTL/WTM) are honored.
             The value may be the density (800, 1600, 6250), or the
             corresponding hex value (C3, D3, etc.).
        WTM - writes 2 tapemarks and unloads the tape.
        WTL volser - initializes the tape with the specified volume
             serial and unloads the tape.
        MAP  for labeled tape maps DSN and DCB for all files.
        FSR nnnnn - forward spaces the specified number of records.
        BSR nnnnn - backspaces the specified number of records.
        FSF nnn - spaces forward the specified number of files.
        BSF nnn - spaces backward the specified number of files.
        LIST or L - lists the current record on the tape in EBCDIC.
             An ENTER following this command repeats the request.
        DUMP or D - dumps in hex and EBCDIC.
             An ENTER following this command repeats the request.
        ERA - erases entire tape (available on model 3420+ only).
             This function is available on STC drives only if it
             is requested from STC.
