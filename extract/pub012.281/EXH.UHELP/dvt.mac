DVT

DVT, or DVC, displays information from the Device Control Table
assembled into the nucleus. On color terminals, device types generated
in the system are yellow, while missing ones are blue. The
displayed values should match those in the format 4 DSCBs, and are used
by the BLKsize and CAPacity displays, among other. To check your
DASD, use the VT4 function.
