VTOC volser <,dsname × ,MASK=dsnmask> <,%INDEX × ,%INDON>

The VTOC function displays Volume Table Of Contents information one
data set at a time. If a "dsname" is supplied, the display is as
described in DSCB, and the "volser" may not be required. If MASK= and
"volser" only are supplied, behaviour is also as shown in DSCB. If
"volser" and "%INDON" (with or without MASK=) are supplied, then
behaviour is as detailed in VINDEX. Otherwise the program displays the
Format 4, 5 and 6 DSCBs; then the VTOC Index if "%INDEX" was
specified; then the Format 1, 2 and 3 entries for each data set on the
volume.
