I/O and WAIT Module - (ZZZZ)

This module invokes the exit module EXHDUSER if the EXIT option is
enabled, adds an ID line to the top of the screen if the ID
option is selected and enabled, and writes the buffer contents
to the CRT. It also checks for pending Attentions from the
CRT, and switches control to the Conversational Display modules
if an Attention has been received.

If no Attention has been received, and a STOP, Modify or CANCEL
command have not been issued, a WAIT is done for the time
specified by SW1 (default of 5 seconds). After the WAIT
interval has expired, the module again checks for Attentions or
pending commands. If none are pending, then control is given
to the first screen formatting module in the list, normally the
DA function. If an Attention is pending, then the
conversational functions are invoked. To process commands, the
module invokes the Command processor module, whose functions
are described in Section 1C of the Operator's Guide.

ID line information:
× date time system release cpu/id×
+----------------------------------------+
×78.234 13:32:50 MVT 21.8A 65/02×
+----------------------------------------+

In SVS, the ID line is shifted left, and followed by the CPU
utilization percentage; this value is derived from CPU time
billed by SMF, and does not include system overhead time. In
addition, if the system is running under VM, two additional
percentage values are shown. The first is CPU time used by the
virtual machine; the second includes CPU time for the machine
plus the associated VM overhead for servicing the machine.
