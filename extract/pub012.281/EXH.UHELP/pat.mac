PATH < cuu, ... >

The addresses of all devices varied or the word "NONE" shows
the result of a valid request. Syntactically invalid input is
rejected with an "INVALID OP" message. Addresses which are
specified with correct hex characters but which do not exist in
the system are ignored.

The PATH command displays the status of alternate paths. It is
invoked from a valid PON request. The command displays the
status of two to four paths for each disk and tape generated
with alternate path support. If the I/O Supervisor has turned
a path off, the entry will be OFF, otherwise it will be ON or
blank (path does not exist).

Note that the commands support alternate paths; neither one may
work correctly for alternate control units.
