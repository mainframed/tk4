NET <resource>

The NET command, when Exhibit is defined as a network operator, issues
display commands to VTAM, and reports the response.

This command was written for ACF/VTAM, which is a newer version than
is running in MVS 3.8 - the only working request seems to be for
terminal names. NET HELP shows all the goodies that are missing.
