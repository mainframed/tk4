UCV

The UCV function originally displayed the user CVT extension at AMS,
CCSI, and PID, but now has been repurposed to display information
for a local extension anchored at CVTLINK+4, otherwise unused in
MVS. The only currently assigned function is for the AUTOCMD
module, which permits assignment of a device and a matching OS
command. When the device is unallocated, an unsolicited interrupt
causes the command to be issued. For start tasks and jobs allocatin
that device, it works only if the program does not use the UCBATI
attention index, or sets the value it needs.
