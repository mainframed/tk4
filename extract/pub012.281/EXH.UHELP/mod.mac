MOD . . . parms

MOD invokes the MODIFY processing modules described in
Section 1C of the Operator's Guide.

Note that several options, e.g. LAYOUT= and FREE, are not
accepted from the CRT due to programming restrictions.
When used from a TSO terminal, the LAYOUT= request will be
honored; the RING request will not.

"parms" signifies one or more options described
below, separated by commas, and containing no blanks.

LIST The LIST request causes a printout of current sweep and
option settings; see the description of message EXH701I
for details.

SHOW The SHOW request causes a printout of the LIST
information, plus location and time information for each
defined Display module; see messages EXH701I and EXH704I
for further description

SW1=n or SW1=nn The decimal value specified by "SW1" gives
the approximate time interval at which the CRT display
will be updated (refered to as a "primary" or "first
level" sweep). The default value is 5 seconds; a lower
value may detrimentally impact system performance, and
should not be used. Display modules which update on a
primary sweep have a corresponding time value of zero.

SW2=n The decimal value specified gives the number of first
level sweeps after which second level functions (time=1)
are invoked; the time interval at which they are invoked
is the product of the values of SW1 times SW2. The
default value is 2; the corresponding default time is 10
seconds.

SW3=n and SW4=n Similar to SW2, these values specify the number
of cycles of the next lower level. SW3 corresponds to
time=2, and SW4 to time=3. Default values are SW3=12 (120
seconds); and SW4=5 (10 minutes).

ULV=n This value specifies the sweep level at which the EXIT
module is to be invoked (=0 specifies SW1, =1 SW2, etc.).

NOEXIT This option prohibits exits to the user module; it is
the default.

EXIT Requests the EXIT option; module EXHDUSER will be invoked
at the cycle specified by ULV= . The AMS local user
module (alias EXHDWAUT) automatically STARTs and STOPs a
dummy Writer for the purpose of cleaning out the garbage
SYSOUT queue (class Z); for proper performance ULV should
be set to 2 or 3, but never lower than the value for the
DQ function. If JES2 is running, then AMS EXIT processing
is automatically disabled. Refer to the message
description of EXH611I and EXH612I for further
information.

NORING Cancels the RING option; this is the default setting.

RING Request the RING option, which causes EXHIBIT to keep
track of conditions requiring Operator action. See
message EXH666A for details.
On a 3270 CRT with the Audible Alarm feature, message
EXH666A will not be issued, the alarm will be sounded
instead.

LAYOUT=name This option requests that screen layout
information be obtained from module EXHLname or EXHNname.
LAYOUT may not be issued from the CRT due to design
restrictions.
The layout modules offer a convenient way of specifying
the location and update cycle of each Display module.
Valid names (exactly four characters) will be supplied by
your systems staff.
Defined modules are :
OURS (DFLT) Standard A.M.S. module.
DFLT (USER) Distributed non-A.M.S. module

FREE This option, if used, should be the only request on a
Modify command. It is not valid from the CRT. This
request may be used to temporarily de-allocate the CRT
belonging to EXHIBIT to let a batch job use it. Following
acceptance of FREE, EXHIBIT cleans up the Unit Control
Block (UCB) and kicks off any Initiator waiting in
Allocation. Refer to messages EXH737I through EXH739I for
further details.
If EXHIBIT has more than one device assigned to it, only
the Master CRT is freed by this command. The other
devices remain allocated and unused.

DELAY This option, if used, should be the only request on a
Modify or Start command. After it is processed, EXHIBIT
will do one I/O to the Master CRT; if the I/O completes
without error, normal processing continues. If any I/O
error occurs, then EXHIBIT will suspend processing until a
subsequent Attention from the terminal, or an OS command
(Stop, Modify or Cancel) is issued. This option permits
an EXHIBIT task to be started for a terminal which is
turned off, and may be used to prevent storage
fragmentation which would occur if EXHIBIT were started on
demand when the terminal is readied.

dd=kkllmmnnt Display module reset command.
"dd" specifies the first two bytes of a display module
name (see EXH704I).
"kk" starting line assigned to the function.
"ll" starting byte on the starting line.
"mm" ending line number
"nn" ending byte on the ending line.
"t" module invokation time :
0 - on all sweeps (SW1) .
1 - on second level sweeps (SW2).
2 - on third level sweeps (SW3).
3 - on fourth level sweeps (SW4).
E - invoked at end of CRT input and following a
Modify command.
F - never; set for modules requested which are not
supplied or not usable, and for modules for
which layout information is incorrect.
Limiting values for location information:
Device LINE MIN LINE MAX BYTE MIN BYTE MAX
480 byte (2260,3277): 1 12 1 40
960 byte (2260): 1 12 1 80
1920 byte (3277): 1 24 1 80
2560 byte (3278): 1 32 1 80
2720 byte (3066): 1 34 1 80
3440 byte (3278): 1 43 1 80

Limitations:
Space for DA (Display Active) should always be a multiple of 40
bytes (80 bytes under MFT), and should always start and end on
a line boundary. Space for DR should be a multiple of 80
bytes, and should end on a line boundary.
Space for DQ (Display Queues) must start and end on line
boundaries, and must always be exactly 2 or exactly 4 lines.
Space for MR and ON may overlap; in this case the starting
space for ON may be exactly the start for MR, or it may be
exactly one line higher
Space for PA (VS only) should be exactly 80 bytes on a line
boundary.
All other functions require a minimum of 13 bytes.
