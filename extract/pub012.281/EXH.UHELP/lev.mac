LEV <opt><DSN=mask>,<CVOL=volser>,<VOL=volser>

The LEVel function formats the contents of catalog data sets, but does
not display DSCB 1 and 3 information (for extended DSCB
information, use the CATalog command, or DSCB for a specific data set).
Input options:
  none - list the system catalog in alphabetic sequence.
  CVOL=volser - list the catalog on disk pack labelled "volser";
Message "PROC. ERROR" is displayed if this pack is not available or
does not contain a catalog.
  VOL=volser - list only entries cataloged as residing on "volser".
  DSN=mask - list only entries starting with "mask"; the value may be
any part of an index or data set name.
  "opt" specifies special retrieval options. If any are used, they
must immediately precede the DSN; they must not be followed by
blanks or commas.
  * - includes hex TTR information; used for error tracing.
  0 - count and display number of empty catalog blocks in a CVOL
(OS/360) catalog.
  <dsn - start the display with the entries matching the mask and
continue from there on.

The above options may be specified together, in the order shown,
separated by commas; the listing will contain only those items which
satisfy all requests. Whenever possible, use DSN= to speed up the
retrieval.

In full-screen mode each applicable line has a one-byte selector byte.
Only the first line command is honored. Supported are:
  B Browse the data set
  C Displays a COPy men
  D Invokes the DIRectory command for a PDS
  E Edit the data set
  I Show detailed information from the format 1 and 3 DSCBs

  T Transfers to the text scan menu.
