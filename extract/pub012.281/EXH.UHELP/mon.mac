MON

The MONitor command loops with a 'no reportable activity' message a
reportable event occurs. The program scans all devices for mounts,
intervention requests, DDR swaps, and missing interrupts. When it finds
none, it checks the communications task for unanswered WTORs.

The first condition it finds is signaled in large letters, intended to
be readable across a computer room.

The function is terminated with PFK3 or PA1.
