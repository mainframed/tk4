Messages issued by EXHIBIT are described on the following pages;
they may be issued in response to normal functioning, or to
indicate an error condition. The general message format is :
EXHmnnt text
"m" represents an indication where in EXHIBIT the message was
issued from -
0 - not used 1 - not used
2 - not used 3 - not used
4 - not used 5 - TSO
6 - EXIT & Display 7 - START, STOP, Modify
8 - Error or poss. 9 - Catastrophic error
error
"nn" is a unique message number.
For 8nn series messages "nn" is the hex number of the SVC which
would have caused an Abend or other problem; for instance, 804
is used for GETMAIN, 813 for Open, 838 for ENQ, etc.
"t" is the message type :
I - informational message only
W - warning message
E - error message
A - operator action required
D - decision required

EXHIBIT module naming convention :
EXHAname Initialization and Control
EXHCname Conversational, further divided :
EXHCCnam Basic Conversational modules
EXHC$nam HASP/JES2 Display functions
EXHC@nam Privileged Systems functions
EXHC8nam ASP/JES3 Display functions

EXH501E TERMINAL TYPE NOT SUPPORTED
Your terminal is defined with a LINESIZE less than
40, or this message was preceded by an EXH804/EXH806
message explaining why non-3270 terminal support is
unavailable.

EXH506E THE TSO VERSION MUST BE RUN UNDER TSO
An attempt was made to run the EXHIBIT TSO code
outside TSO.

EXH507E SUB-TASK ATTACH ERROR
The ATTACH of the EXHIBIT subtask failed. Check the
dump; if due to an E04, this is an installation
problem. Otherwise it is a program error.

EXH508E STAX FAILED
The STAX function is used to provide EXHIBIT
Attention support for the PA1, ATTN and BREAK keys.
If this message is issued, processing will continue
with TSO provided ATTN support - when ATTN is
entered, EXHIBIT will be terminated. This may cause
I/O errors on the EXHPRINT file, and may result in
incomplete processing of WHO, @ZAP and similar
requests. The message indicates a system or program
error.

EXH513E mod-name ABENDED Sxxx; APSW=hex; PSW=hex
The EXHIBIT subtask has abended with the indicated
System or User completion code. A dump will be taken
provided a DD for SYSUDUMP or SYSABEND is available.

EXH599I CIAO
EXHIBIT termination message in response to STOP, END
or ABEND. Users at a 3270 should switch back to
normal mode from FULL SCREEN mode (using the CLEAR or
other installation defined key) when this message is
issued.

EXH611I AUTOWTR ENABLED (AMS/Technion only)
This message is produced in response to a startup or
the first enable of the EXIT option. Issued by
EXHDWAUT. It signifies that the AUTOmatic WTR
feature is enabled, and, unless JES2 is active, the
DRANO writer will be started periodically to clean
out the garbage queue. Under JES2 the AUTOWTR is
dynamically disabled.
This message will normally be followed by the OS
message IEE341I W69 NOT ACTIVE; this message may be
ignored. It is used to synchronize AUTOWTR with
operator started Writers. The Start "id" will be
W69; the queue Z, and the PROC name will be DRANO.

EXH612I AUTOWTR UNAVAILABLE
This message is issued in response to initial Startup
or following the enable of the EXIT option, if the
running system is not MVT, does not support AMS local
code, and does not have a CVTUSER extension. Issued
by EXHDWAUT.

EXH666A ACTION REQUIRED, mm, nn, . . .
This message is issued by module EXHDZZZZ when
operator action is required, and the RING option has
been selected. On a 3270 with the Audible Alarm
feature, the message is suppressed and the Alarm is
sounded instead. The message is triggered when one
or more Display Functions determine that Operator
Intervention is needed for the entire duration of a
third level sweep (default is 2 minutes). The
function spotting the need is indicated in the
message by a two letter abbreviation :
DQ - Jobs on the Input or HOLD queue, and/or queues
in HOLD status, when there are no jobs running.
DR - a WTOR has not been responded to. For some jobs
this may be normal; in this case disable the RING
option.
IR - An Intervention Request is pending for one or
more devices.
MR - Indicates a pending MOUNT request, either
specific or AVR.

EXH700I EXHIBIT ON cu
This message is issued by EXHAINIT in response to the
initial START command, indicating that the Start has
been accepted, and showing the CRT address to be
used.

EXH700I MODIFY ACCEPTED
Issued by EXHAMODS in response to a MODify request,
or for initial "parms" information at start time; it
indicates that no errors were found during parameter
processing.

EXH701I SW1=mmm, SW2=nn, SW3=ii, SW4=jj, ULV=kk, LAYOUT=name,
. . .
This message is issued by EXHAMODS in response to a
LIST request and when any of the numeric parameters
are modified. All values are described in
the MODify member, except:
ID is described in member ZZ; when the message
includes the word ID, then the ID option is enabled.
The warning message NO INPUT is used to show that
EXHIBIT was assembled without the CRT Input option,
or that modules required to support CRT input are not
available.
Other options are indicated by their presence or
absence in the message.

EXH704I name AT mm nn- mm nn; ss tt
This message is issued by EXHAMODS in response to a
SHOW request; it is preceded by message EXH701I, and
is issued once for each "name" module defined on the
display.
"name" is the suffix of a display module name (the
full name is EXHDname).
"mm nn" are the starting and ending screen positions
allocated to the function by the last LAYOUT or
function reset request.
"ss" is the function's current sweep cycle "time"
"tt" is the originally requested "time" value.
The numeric values used are the same as those for a
function reset. Refer to SHOW in member MODify for a
description.

EXH704W NO DISPLAY FUNCTIONS DEFINED
This message is issued by EXHAMODS in response to a
LAYOUT or initial Start request when the LAYOUT
module involved does not contain any valid
definitions, or if none of the requested modules are
available. During Startup, the program will try to
recover by using the "default" LAYOUT module EXHLDFLT
or EXHNDFLT. At MODify time, the LAYOUT request will
be ignored.

EXH707W ERRORS IN LAYOUT=name
In response to a LAYOUT request, EXHAMODS has found
one or more errors. Subsequent messages will be
issued to detail the error condition(s). Depending
on error severity, EXHIBIT may use part of the
requested LAYOUT information, reject the request, or
terminate (if Startup).

EXH708W name UNAVAILABL
This message is issued by EXHAMODS in response to a
LAYOUT request for an unusable EXHDname module. The
name may be incorrect, the screen positions may be
invalid, or the module may be an incorrect size.
This message will be preceded by EXH707W and does not
cause rejection of the LAYOUT definition.

EXH708W NO JES2 SUPPORT
This message is issued by EXHAMODS in response to a
LAYOUT definition which does not specify display
module EXHDDAxx as the first module, and when the
JES2 support option was chosen at EXHIBIT assembly
time. The message is issued even when JES2 is not
currently running; it simply indicates that no JES2
dependent code will be available.

EXH708E NO EXECUTABLE MODULES
This message is issued when a LAYOUT request is
rejected because the modules in it are too large for
the region, or are not available (not found, not
executable or non-reentrant). The previous LAYOUT,
if any, will be used.

EXH708E EXHDZZZZ NOT LAST MODULE
The CRT I/O module EXHDZZxx appears at an incorrect
location in the LAYOUT definition, or not at all.
The LAYOUT request is rejected.

EXH709E NO MODIFY PARAMETERS
A MODify was issued, but did not contain any
parameters. Correct your input request and retry.

EXH709E INVALID : text. . .
A MODify request specified unacceptable input. Check
for bad spelling, non-existing function name,
incorrect length, missing comma, or bad numeric
value.
Options preceding "text" will have been processed
normally; requests following the bad "text" have been
ignored.

EXH737I CRT RELEASED
Issued by module EXHAMODX in response to a FREE
request on a MODify. The CRT assigned to EXHIBIT has
been un-allocated and the Allocation ECB has been
POSTed to kick off any waiting Initiator.

EXH738I CRT NOT BEING WAITED ON
In response to a FREE request, EXHIBIT determined
that no other job was waiting on EXHIBIT's CRT. The
CRT is not un-allocated, and the FREE request is
rejected.

EXH739I CRT RE-ALLOCATE
EXHIBIT has found its CRT unused and un-allocated,
has re-allocated it to itself, and will resume normal
Display mode on it.

EXH755I EXHIBIT SLAVE CRT cuu
The CRTs listed are slave devices for the current
EXHIBIT task; normal display output will be written
to these whenever the screen of the primary CRT is
updated. Input mode is not supported for these
devices.

EXH756I EXHIBIT PRINTER cuu
The 3284/3286 at the specified address is available
for PRINT command output.

EXH758E INVALID DEB FORMAT FOR SLAVE/PRINTER SUPPORT
Due to a system change in the DEB format, EXHIBIT
cannot generate device entries for optional units.
If this message occurs on your system, force a dump
and notify AMS for correction of the problem.

EXH759W UNIT cuu IGNORE
Slave/Printer support for the listed device is not
provided due to one or more of the following problems
Device type does not match master CRT.
More than 5 CRTs in the Job JCL.
More than 4 CRTs plus one printer
Device is already allocated to another EXHIBIT.

EXH800E jobname I/O ERROR ON cuu
This is the first of a series of messages announcing
a CRT or Printer I/O Error. The message is followed
by the ECB completion code, the CSW, CCW and current
CCW address. For the Printer, the contents of these
fields may not be meaningful. Also shown are the
Status bytes (in hex and abbreviation), and, when
available, the Sense bytes.
This is followed by a message showing the possible
causes of the error; for instance HARDWARE, PROGRAM,
USER, etc. A reply is then solicited from the
Operator showing recovery options; at a minimum the
operator will have a choice between termination with
or without a dump. For secondary devices the error
may sometimes be ignored; some errors lend themselves
to one or more retries (loss of power). If EXHIBIT
is running with a Slave CRT, then one of the options
will be to SWAP the failing Primary unit with a Slave
unit. Message EXH800I is issued following a
successful swap; message EXH800W if the swap is
unsuccessful.

When a Read error occurs, the message "READ ERR - RETRY"
appears on the screen; if the error persists, but no error
occurs on a Write, then the CE should be called. No recovery
from this condition is provided by EXHIBIT.

When an error occurs on a Write, it may be ignored by the
program. If it is not, control is given to module EXHAMIOW,
which produces one or more EXH800E error messages. The
contents of the messages is essentially the same as that issued
by OS in the IEA000I message, but EXHIBIT tries to specify the
source or probable cause of error also.
The line ERROR DUE TO shows possible causes; among them
programming (always causes termination), hardware (Channel or
Interface or similar major errors), Device errors and User
errors. Note that an error may be shown as having more than
one cause; e.g. Intervention Request on a 3270 may be due to
the device or to a User's having turned off power.

Following the EXH800E message, a WTOR with message code EXH800D
requests one of several actions.
Provided at a minimum is the choice between CANCEL and END.
END results in termination without a dump, CANCEL in
termination with a dump
Warning: Note the restriction on the use of Cancel under
Section 1B of the Operator's Guide. (OS/MVT 21.6 only)
The other options, which may not be always present, are:
RETRY - tries to issue another Write to the device. If no
error occurs on this write, then the normal Display cycle is
restarted. If an error other than Intervention Request is
signalled, then no further retries are permitted; if the error
was an Int.Req., then an unlimited number of retries are
allowed.
The option IGNORE causes the use of the device to be lost until
EXHIBIT is shut down and restarted.

SWAP cuu TO cuu allows the functions of the Master CRT to
be transfered to the specified Secondary CRT. This transfer
includes Input Processing; after the swap, the original Master
CRT will no longer respond to Attentions, and the specified
Secondary will. SWAP will retry the I/O on the Secondary
device; if this retry results in an error, then both devices
become unavailable and the EXHIBIT task should be shut down.
DELAY causes EXHIBIT to retry the I/O. If the retry is
successful, normal processing resumes. If the retry is
unsuccessful, no error message is issued, and EXHIBIT becomes
dormant until the terminal issues an Attention, or until an OS
command is received (Stop, Cancel or Modify). Note that some
terminals have the Delay option assembled in; for these, an I/O
error message will not normally occur except when the error is
detected asynchronously; the completion code for this case is
normally 7E. The preferred response for this code is Retry or
Delay, unless the error persists.

If any problem recurs, save all pertinent information and call
the C.E.

EXH800D REPLY CANCEL,END,RETRY,IGNORE,SWAP
This WTOR lists the options available in response to
the EXH800E message described above. Only the first
three characters of the reply are examined. CANCEL
and END are the only options always present; other
options will be present only if supported for the
prevailing error condition and the device setup.

EXH800W SWAP CANCELLE
The SWAP requested by a response to EXH800D has not
been made due to an additional I/O error on the new
device or due to previously unrecognized problems
with the control block setup. This message will be
followed by another EXH800D message.

EXH800I SWAP cuu TO cuu COMPLETE
The requested swap has been performed; functions of
the two listed CRTs have been interchanged.

EXH804I EXHmname UNAVAILABLE
The module printed could not fit into the available
storage; inform Systems and try to run in a larger
region.

EXH804E EXHmname UNAVAILABLE
The module printed could not fit into available
storage. If the module name is EXHATALK, then the
CRT Conversational Input mode is cancelled; any other
module starting with EXHA, and module EXHDZZZZ, will
cause EXHIBIT to terminate in this condition. Inform
Systems, and try starting EXHIBIT in a larger
Region/Partition.

EXH804E REGION FRAGMENTED OR TOO SMALL
TSO EXHIBIT requires approximately 40K, most in one
contiguous block. Try a LOGON, if this does not
help, request a larger region. If nothing helps, you
may have found a program or system error.

EXH804W EXHmname UNAVAILABLE
The module could not fit into available storage;
execution will continue without the module.

EXH804W/EXH804E/EXH806W/EXH806E mod-name UNAVAILABLE
A required TSO module (or storage for *CORE* could
not be obtained. For 804, storage was not available.
See message EXH804E above. For 806, the module was
improperly link-edited or does not exist, or an I/O
error occured during BLDL. Try to LOGON again; check
with systems personnel if the problem persists.
Modules EXHATSOB and EXHAMODT are required; an abend
will be issued following the message. Module
EXHATSOP is required for non-3270 terminals; for 3270
terminals, processing continues without PRINT support
or buffer compression. *CORE* refers to working
storage required for EXHATSOP processing; if
unavailable, EXHATSOP will not function.

EXH806I EXHmname UNAVAILABLE
The specified module was not found, not re-entrant or
not executable. Notify Systems. Continued execution
is possible.

EXH806E EXHmname UNAVAILABLE
The specified module was not found, not re-entrant or
not executable. Notify Systems. Continued execution
is not expected.

EXH806W EXHmname UNAVAILABLE
The specified module was not found, not re-entrant or
not executable. Notify Systems. Execution may
continue without the module.

EXH808W EXHPname UNAVAILABLE
The specified module was not found, not re-entrant or
not executable. The module defines CRT
Options/Privileges; execution may continue without
the module.

EXH808W EXHPname INVALID MODULE FOUND
The specified module was not in correct format for an
EXHP module defining CRT Options/Privileges;
execution may continue without the module. Notify
Systems of the problem.

EXH808W EXHRxxxy UNAVAILABLE
The specified module was not found in the Link-Pack
area, or is otherwise not usable. Execution will
continue; the BRODCAST command will not work, and
system overhead will be higher. In VS2, check that
the module was added to the LPA, and that a CLPA was
used at IPL time. In all systems, check that the
name in the EXHPname module is the desired one.
Check that the proper CRT size was chosen. In MVT,
check that the module was added to a SYS1.PARMLIB
list (IEARAMxx) which was used to IPL, and that the
module exists in a library in LNKLST00.

EXH813E ddname MISSING/BAD
The procedure for EXHIBIT contains an incorrect DD
card for the EXHIBIT CRT, the DD card is missing from
the PROCedure, the Start command was issued with an
invalid unit override, or else the unit address and
type do not match the EXHIBIT Assembly time
specifications. EXHIBIT will accept a DDname of
IEFRDER in the PROC, in addition to the form DDunit,
e.g. DD2260 or DD3270. If the problem was not the
PROC or the Start command, check module EXHAINIT,
which issued this message.

EXH813E STEPLIB ERROR, DD IGNORED
The START command or PROCedure specified a STEPLIB DD
card which does not point to a Partitioned Data Set,
or which is otherwise unacceptable. The message is
issued by module EXHASLIB.

EXH813W LOADLIB DCB UNUSABLE
The TSO LOGON Procedure does not contain a LOADLIB
DCB, the Open failed, or an ALLOCate was not issued
for the EXHIBIT Load Module library. Unless the
EXHIBIT data set is in a STEPLIB or all modules have
been added to CMDLIB, an EXH806E message will be
issued, followed by command termination.

EXH813W EXHPRINT OPEN FAILED
Either no DD for EXHPRINT was allocated, or Open
abended. Processing continues without PRINT support.
An abend may be expected if the DD exists and defines
a SYSOUT data set which has become full. If PRINT
support is required, END EXHIBIT and LOGON again.

EXH814E EXHPRINT ABENDED ccc-nn
A PRINT request has abended in Open/Close/EOV during
a PUT. Printing is discontinued; in some systems,
this will be followed by an abend. An error message
will always be printed on the Operator's console.
For x37 abends, LOGON again to have the current
SYSOUT printed and to obtain a new data set.

EXH82AE TIMECHECK FAILE
This message is issued by EXHATMCK when the Attach
for the Time-check subtask fails, or the subtask
abends just after startup. Report to systems. For
an 806 subtask abend, check that the Executor module
EXCXLINK resides in LPA

EXH838E UNIT cuu NOT AVAILABLE
A second START command for EXHIBIT was issued to the
same CRT. The first copy of EXHIBIT was in un-
allocated mode and allocation permitted the second
one to start. To prevent this possibility, EXHIBIT
ENQueues on SYSEXHIB/cuu ; when the second copy is
started it terminates after issuing this message from
EXHAINIT.

EXH900E EXHIBIT UNABLE TO CONTINUE
This is a "catch all" message following some other
message with an error code. Normally it is followed
by an Abend with Dump. A dump may not be produced if
a SYSABEND or SYSUDUMP data set is not included in the
PROC, does not specify enough SYSOUT space, or if the
Abend is related to a Getmain or similar storage
availability problem.
