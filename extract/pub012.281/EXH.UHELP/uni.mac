UNIT <devtype>

The UNIT function presents summary status information for
hardware units.

"devtype" makes the display selective; one of TAPE,DISK
may be used. Note that the desired option may be
abbreviated to its first letter only, e. g. A to select
ALL, D to select DISK, etc. Disk types may also be
selected using 2314, 3330(single), 333D(double), 3340 and
3350.

The display is terminated by an "END OF UNIT DISPLAY" message;
else an ENTER will retrieve additional data.

If the system is running under VM, units generated but not
attached are not displayed (they are displayed by the UCB
command).

unless an UNLOAD command is issued and performed, resulting in
a "FREE" status display
