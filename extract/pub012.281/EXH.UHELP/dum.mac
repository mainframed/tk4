DUMP < < > < hexadr × keyword >

The DUMP program formats resident storage starting at the address
specified by the "hexadr" parameter, the address computed for
"keyword", or location zero if no parameter was used. A leading
less-than sign (<) left-adjusts the display lines.

   Valid keywords are

     AVT     TCAM Address Vector Table (rejected if TCAM inactive)
     CVT     Communications Vector Table
     IORMS   I/O Recovery Management Table
     MSRDA   Master Scheduler Resident Data Area
     PVT     VS2 - Page Vector Table
     SVCT    Secondary Communications Vector Table
     TSCVT   Time Sharing Communications Vector Table
       (rejected if TSO is not active)
     $HCT    JES2 Communication Table (rejected if JES2 inactive)
     WORK    EXHIBIT Work Area
     COMM    EXHIBIT Communications Area
     SQSP    EXHIBIT System Queue Space
     CSCB    Retrieve the first Command Scheduling Control
       Block from the CSCB chain; subsequent replies of
       ampersand or ENTER will in turn retrieve the
       next block on the chain. If the chain has been
       altered by the system during the display, then
       the results are unpredictable; in most cases
       continued display will be feasible.
       CSCB/name scan for the specified job/task name.
       Note that the display stays in BUMP mode.
     $DCT    JES2 Device Control Tables 3)
       $DCT/name scan for unabbreviated device name.
     $PCE    JES2 Processor Control Elements 3)
       $PCE/name scan for executing job's PCE.
     PFTE    VS2 - Page Frame Table Entry (Assignable real
       page frames)

In DUMP mode an ENTER will redisplay the current page; an ampersand
will display the next page.

In BUMP mode, an ENTER will display the next element on the chain.
Also refer to the BUMP and LOOP commands.

In addition, several other subcommands are available:
  . This command redisplays starting at the current BASE value.

The BASE value is the first requested DUMP address, or the start
address of the last displayed control block in chain mode.
  hexadr display at the specified address. BASE value is not changed.
  +hexadr -hexadr display at BASE+-hexadr
  .hexadr .+-hexadr display and use the new address as the next BASE
value.
  address% takes the low three bytes of the calculated address value,
truncated to a word boundary, as the next display value; e.g. DUMP CVT
followed by .+64% would display the UCM, and use the UCM address as
the new BASE.
  + advance to the next page or control block.
  - backspace to the previous page or control block.
  < left-adjust all display lines; display next page.
  * or LOOP sets LOOP mode
  PA1 key cancels LOOP mode and sets HOLD mode.
  EBCDIC - reset all translation options to the normal (default) mode.
  ANSI or ASCII - translates from ASCII code (e.g. for viewing tape
I/O buffers).
  TTY - translates from ASCII code used for TTY terminals (e.g. for
WYLBUR RTB display).
  TERM - uses the special terminal translation table if one was
defined in the options member (EXHPxxxx option TRAN=). For Memorex
1377s, this enables display of special characters.

An ALTER command issued from a DUMP/BUMP display keeps the BASE value
set. ALTER may be used with a relative address.
