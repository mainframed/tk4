WHO ...parameters...

The WHO function permits access to and alteration of the Passwords
used by PASSWORD. CHANGE is the only function available in normal,
LOCKed mode; it allows a user to change the current PASSWORD.

After you enter WHO, wait for a "SPECIFY REQUEST" message. At this
time you may enter your request : CHANGE name,oldpassw,newpassw

After the information is accepted, it will be re-written to disk.
Normal completion will be indicated by a "SUCCESSFUL UPDATE"
message; note that some messages may request immediate notification of
the Systems Group - this should be done at any and all times.

Changing Password information is restricted to one CRT at a time. If
two or more CRTs try to do updates at the same time, the
subsequent ones will be forced into a WAIT state until the first update
is completed. No message is issued to indicate the reason for
the WAIT.
An explicit response of END is required to return to normal mode.

Additional functions are available to users authorized for KEY mode;
the privileged functions are:
LIST                         list all current Passwords
ADD name,password,func       add a new user
"func" indicates the type of authorization to be used
for this name. SYS sets KEY mode; SUP sets UNLOCK
and PASSWORD mode; CON sets PASSWORD mode; and OPER
sets UNLOCK mode. Any of these may be preceded by an
asterisk to also set HOLD mode.
DEL name,password delete an existing user
