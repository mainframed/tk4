$JOB jobname × number <,options...>

This function displays JES2 information from the Job Control Table
(JCT), and data set information.

The job to be displayed is specified by a job name (first positional
operand), or a keyword of J=, S=, or T= for JOB, STC, and TSU.

When the request is for a job name, rather than number, and there are
multiple jobs with that name, a selection screen is shown. You may
type the number of the desired job and hit ENTER, or you may place
the cursor on a digit of the job number and hit ENTER. PF3/PF15
will cancel the request

Options:
Q = ª IN × OUT × REM × HOLD × EXEC × RDR × OTH ³
DSN=ds# will display a specific data set.

The information will be displayed as one or more pages on the CRT. The
first page is the JCT, which gives basic information on the source,
destination, and options of the job. Subsequent pages show the JES2 LOG,
the JCL, and then the individual data sets. In a data set
display, additional options are available, as detailed for the $DSN
command.

Neither input nor output data sets are displayed unless the requesting
CRT is set to some privilege level (e.g. Primary CRT, UNLock,
PASsword, etc.).
