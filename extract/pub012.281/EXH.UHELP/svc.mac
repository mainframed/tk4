SVCTABLE < nnn >

The SVC command shows the number, type, and address of SVCs.
For non-resident SVCs, the address is replaced by the TT.R and
length. Note that non-resident type 3 and 4 SVCs made resident
in the LPA will display as type 2.
The "nnn" parameter may specify the SVC number with which to begin the
display.
