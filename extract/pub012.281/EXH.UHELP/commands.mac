The Exhibit program is designed to produce output on a 3270 CRT (older
versions also supported the IBM 2260), and to offer conversational
functions.

By default, a screen with current system status is produced:
 a) Id line - time, date, SMF id, CPU type, and CPU and sliding
average CPU (L/T) are shown. {ZZ}
 b) Next lines display start tasks, initiators, and TSO sessions. {DA}
 c) The next line shows Paging and Swap counters. {PA}
 d) The next two lines show JES2 queues and the number of jobs on
each;the number followed by a percent sign is % free spool space. {DQ}
 e) The next lines lists units with a pending intervention
request.{IR}
 f) The next line(s) show units currently off-line (but see ªSPARES³
in the OPTIONS data set). {OF}
 g) The next line(s) show the numbers of pending WTORs, and their text
subject to available space. {DR}
 h) The next line shows the unit and volume serial for each tape or
disk with a pending mount request. {MR}
 i) The last lines display mounted DASD sorted by volume serial. {ON}

The braces show the member for which additional help information is
available; e.g., HELP DA shows information for the active task display.

Conversational mode is entered by pressing a Program Function or
Program Attention key. Depending on the security level, the response
is either a YES> prompt, or a sign-on screen.

Exhibit may be set to several levels of security protection. When NONE
or LAX is specified, all unrestricted functions are accessible,
but restricted functions are available only after the user has
entered either an UNLock, KEY, or PASsword command. PAS is table
driven, and must be maintained by the installation.
STRICT security produces a sign-on screen requesting a user id,
password, and (installation optional) account number. The id and
password are checked against the SYS1.UADS data set, and the TSO
privileges (Mount, Job, Acct, Oper) are mapped to corresponding Exhibit
privileges.
RACF/RAKF security checks the user id using the RACF/RAKF data base,
but (currently) sets the privileges from the UADS entry for that
user, if any, otherwise it uses the group from the ACEE. When
RACF/RAKF is not available, checking drops back to UADS verification.

When sign-on is completed, or when the YES> prompt appears, you may
enter a conversational command (listed below). Please note that
this uses a non-standard input convention - to allow sharing the
top line with the Id display, the input is considered terminated
at the cursor. So YES> pds sys2.asm_ would display the
directory, but YES> pds_sys2.asm would give an error for using pds
without operand.

Exhibit was written a long time before SDSF, so the Program Function
keys do not match. Most functions have been converted to use PFK3
to end a function, but some Exhibit functions do not recognize
this and require PA 1 to exit. The SET command and the options
data set permit function and attention keys to be redefined, but
reassignment of PFK3, PFK 15, and PA 1 will be ignored except on the YES
prompt.

Many functions were written to work on a line terminal as well as a
CRT, so conventional subcommands such as UP and DOWN (PF 7/8) are
not supported, and entering a misspelled command terminates the
function. Some functions are available in both modes; e.g., $LOC finds
jobs by prefix, but $SEL not only selects by prefix, but supports
line commands to issue JES2 commands, an OS CANCEL, or a $JOB
display.

The code was originally written for a terminal with a line width of 80
characters. All commands, other than a few games, should work on a model
5. A terminal with explicit partitions should be set to a
minimum width of 80, and at least 12 lines.

In general, all input is converted to upper case. Some functions,
e.g., UPDate, support mixed case, and offer an UPPER/LOWER
subcommand.

This member is displayed in response to a HELP command with no
operands. Once in help mode, additional members may be displayed by
typing the command (or member) name.

Common error messages are explained in member MESSAGES. Additional
information for the TSO HELP data sets is in member TSH.
