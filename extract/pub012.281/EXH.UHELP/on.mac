This function lists the volume serials of available Disk Packs.
The display is skipped if it shares screen space with the MR
function, and a Mount message is pending. If 80 or fewer bytes
are allocated for display space, then the display shows only
volume-serials of mounted volumes and the "cuu" addresses of
on-line but unused disk drives. If more space is available,
then the display shows
cuu - available drive
cuu* - off-line drive
volser - inactive volum
volser+ - disk with open data sets
volser& - disk with allocated or passed data sets
volser* - inactive disk, reserved or permanently resident.
