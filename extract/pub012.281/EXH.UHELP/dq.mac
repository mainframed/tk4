Display Queues - (DQ)

Under OS without HASP the Display Queue function does a large amount
of I/O to the Job Queue. For this reason it is invoked only on
third level cycles, resulting in a display which is always a little
out of date. Under JES2 the sweep level is set faster
automatically.

   Line 1:  IN: HOLD ASB A B C ... OTH TSO OUT: A B ...OTH    Line 2: nn
The left side displays Input Queues, the right side Output Queues; the
second line contains the number of jobs on the queue. "nn%" gives
the percentage free queue space available. Under JES2 this is the
free SPOOL space. The count under "OTH" shows the total number of
jobs on queues which did not fit on the display.

An asterisk preceding the queue name indicates that the queue is in
HOLD status ($HA under JES2). If an * replaces the O in HOLD, then
a general HQ or $HA was issued.
Under OS without HASP/JES2, an I/O error on the queue is possible and
is indicated with a question mark following the queue name, e.g.
A?, HOL?, etc.
