PRINT

The PRINT function described here will not work from a TSO terminal.
Under TSO, print support is provided using a SYSOUT file with a
DDname of EXHPRINT. Printing of all terminal I/O is enabled using
"PRINT ON", printing is disabled using "PRINT OFF". See TSHELP for
details.

The PRINT command copies the contents of the current screen on a
graphics printer (3284,3286) defined in the EXHIBIT Start Procedure.
The message "DONE" is issued about 30 seconds after the request to
indicate successful completion of the PRINT operation.
The message "NONE" is issued when a printer is not available in the
supplied JCL/PROC for EXHIBIT, or when a supplied printer becomes
unavailable due to permanent I/O errors, or when the user is
unauthorized.

If no response is received after a minute, check the OS Consoles for
possible error messages. If an error has not occured, check for
possible delays - channel tied up, hardware busy with other I/O, etc.
If no error can be found, call Systems. Alternatively, if the
printer is shared and not an active OS Console, try taking it out of
ready and watch for error recovery messages. If no messages appear,
the system may be hung. Try cancelling EXHIBIT with a dump. Try a
DUMP command; try anything ?
