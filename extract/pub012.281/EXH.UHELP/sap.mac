SAP no operands (3270 version)

The SAP function permits a privileged user to lock the
terminal. After the "name,password" entry is accepted, only
input of "password" will release the terminal. All other input
is rejected. The most important function of SAP (assuming you
wish to remain friends with your colleagues) is to determine if
anyone else knows your password - see WHO on changing it.
