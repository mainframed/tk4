PASSWORD name,password (2260 version)
PASSWORD no operands (3270 version)

The PASSWORD Function permits limited access to some System
Modification programs and some otherwise restricted functions
and data.

The "name" parameter represents the user's 2 or 3 character
Initials; "password" the corresponding 3 to 8 byte Password.

On a 3270, only PASSWORD or PAS is entered; the "name,password"
field is supplied in response to the subsequent "PASSWORD ?"
request. The response will not be shown on the screen; only
the cursor position is displayed. To correct a mistake (prior
to hitting ENTER) you may use the "Erase Input" button; this
clears the input and repositions the cursor. An erroneous
request will require re-entry of PAS.

AMS note : the PASSWORD request, which may be abbreviated to
PAS, must be issued prior to requesting any changes to the Tape
Library. The privileged mode is turned off if control is
returned to the normal Display Mode; or it may be turned off
using the LOCK function

Note also that you may change your Password at any time using
the WHO function documented later on in this manual.
