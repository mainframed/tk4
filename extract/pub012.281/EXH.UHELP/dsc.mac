DSCB dsname<,volser> × volser<,MASK=dsnmask>

The DSCB routine displays Format 1, 2, and 3 Data Set Control Block
information.

"dsname" requests a specific data set; "dsnmask" a group of data sets
starting with the specified mask. The "dsname" and "dsnmask"
parameters are mutually exclusive.

When a mask is used, then entry of an ampersand and ENTER will
position to the next data set.

The "volser" operand must be specified with the MASK= option; it need
not be supplied for a cataloged "dsname". Both the "dsname" and
"dsnmask" parameters may be supplied with surrounding quotes.

Mask characters are ? and *. The question mark matches any character
in that position, and the asterisk is a terminal match. E.g.,
DSCB HERC03.???.*,PUB000 displays data sets on PUB000 that begin
with HERC03, and have a three character second index level.

For a description of error and processing messages refer to the VTOC
function description.
