DIR pdsname <,volser>

The DIR command displays member information, and permits the
privileged user to modify PDS directory entries. The PDS data set name
is required; the volume-serial may be omitted if reference to
the catalog is to be made.

The available unprivileged subcommands are:

DISplay - quick list of member names

LISt × LIS member × LIS start end
LIST displays all, specific, or a range of members. Listed are the
member name, and an asterisk if the name represents an alias. In
full-screen mode, the list display accepts line commands of X (scratch),
U (update), E (edit), S (select U or E).

SSI member      displays the SSI information for a member.

ATTR member     for a load-module, displays the Linkage Editor
assigned attributes. If the name is an alias, the main member name is
displayed also.

CSECT member or
SECT member     list the CSECT entries for a load-module in
alphanumeric sequence

HIStory member  displays IDR information by CSECT for a load-module.

MAP member      displays the CSECTs of a load-module in ascending
sequence. For a module with the OVERLAY attribute, also shows the size
of the module without overlay. For modules with the SCATTER LOAD
attribute (system nucleus) the display is specific to the system type,
and the display will give incorrect information if used on a PDS
from a different system version.

Privileged options:

ALIAS member aliasname     assigns the new alias to the specified
member.

ATTR member attributes... changes the load-module attributes (a NO
prefix negates the attribute). Available are PAGE, REFR, RENT, REUS,
AC(n)

REName member newname     renames a member. Note that for all alias
load-modules under VS, and reentrant/reusable modules under MVT/MFT, the
main member name and entry address are not changed. If a member
with alias entries is to be changed, then the alias entries should
be deleted, the main member renamed, and the alias entries
re-assigned to obtain correct directory information.

SCRatch member  deletes the member from the directory. Note that alias
entries left pointing to the member are not changed.

SSI member newssi     alter SSI data for a load module.

The DIR function requires substantial storage for some functions, e.g.
a system nucleus may require a running region of 30K. Also note
that DIR issues a shared Enqueue for the data set, but will
rewrite the DSCB when a directory change is made, and the number of
free bytes in the last directory block changes.
