REMOVE < D × T × D,T
R < D × T × D,T >

The Remove function flags all possible drives with an Unload
pending. When a job subsequently enters termination or
initiation, the drives are unloaded by the system.

If no options are specified, the Unload is set only for disk
drives. The D and T parameters may be used to specify either
Disk or Tape processing

Only those units are processed which have no open data sets,
which are removable (not resident or reserved), and which have
no passed data sets.

Any unit flagged for Unload is shown on the display; if no
units are found, the message "NONE" is shown instead.

Note: You should be careful at what time you issue the Remove
request; if used at the wrong time, you will make extra work
for yourself.

Restriction: Remove is valid only from an Operator CRT.
