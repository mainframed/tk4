DEV <mask>

The DEVice function formats the Device Name and Mask tables for
the running system (DEVNAMET, DEVMASKT). In OS, sufficient
storage must be available to load at least the larger one into
the EXHIBIT Region; if the larger module exceeds Region less
8K, then an UNAVAILABLE message will be issued. The EXHIBIT
region is irrelevant if the modules reside in the Link-Pack
Area.

The display shows, for each Name table entry:
Mask - Hexadecimal mask used by allocation
Name - Generic or special Device name
nnnn - number of units of this type
Units - One or more unit addresses.
Error messages may be issued if discrepancies are found between
the definitions and the UCB lookup table (CVTILK2).

When the command is used with the "mask" option, selected
entries are displayed. The compare is made against the device
type, generic name, and, when the mask is 3 bytes or less, the
unit address. The mask may contain a quote (") as a general
match character; e.g.
DEV 4"0 might return entries for TP devices (device type
400...), and devices on channel 4.
