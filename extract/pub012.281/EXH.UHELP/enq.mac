ENQ <opt>< resource >,< JOB=name × JOB=userid >
ENQ <opt> &
ENQ ?

The ENQ function displays the system Enqueue chain.
Input of ENQ only will scan all ENQ requests; if the "resource"
operand is used, only the requested resources, if any, are
shown. With JOB= only those ENQs whose TCB has "name" as
either a job or step name will be displayed. If "&" is used,
all ENQ entries other than SYSDSN are shown.
An END OF CHAIN message will follow the last ENQ, if any.
"opt" bytes may be used to precede the request; they are
separated by blanks or commas from the remaining text.
* include hex control block addresses
? check for ENQ hangs; only entries contributing to an ENQ
Wait are displayed, subject to the remainder of the request.
Existence of a hang is reported even if no entries are
displayed.
Display format :
Major queue name, ("resource"), one to 8 bytes.
TCB address of ENQueued task
SYS or JOB denotes system or step ENQ request.
SYS.MC, STP.MC or blanks request was in
"system must complete", "step must complete" or not
in "must complete" mode
EXC or SHR request for EXClusive or SHaRed control of the
resource.
ENQ or RES request was ENQ or REServe.
** shown if task is in an ENQ Wait
Minor Queue name if the minor queue name is shorter than
eight bytes, and contains undisplayable characters,
it is displayed in hex: X'xxxx'.
If the Minor name is sufficiently short:
JOBNAME/STEPNAME of the requesting task (non-TSO).
USERID/Line # for TSO user entry.

You should be familiar with the standard system ENQ names,
particularly SYSDSN, SYSVTOC, SYSIEFSD (and Q1-Q9); these will
be your most frequent entries. A persistent entry for SYSIEECT
may indicate a non-recoverable condition after running out of
console or log buffers.
