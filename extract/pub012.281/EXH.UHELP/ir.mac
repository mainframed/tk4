Intervention Request display - (IR)

+----------------------------------------+
×73 RQES; INT.REQ: DDR 282* 00C 280 281? ×
+----------------------------------------+
The IR function displays the channel/unit address (referred to
as "cuu"), of any devices for which an Intervention Request
message has been printed and which is still pending. In a
system using the Time-Check (TMCK) Service Aid, units being
monitored by TMCK are displayed with a question mark. Unless
an entry persists, no action need be taken. If the System
includes Dynamic Device Reconfiguration (DDR), units awaiting
DDR processing are displayed with an asterisk. In addition,
the display will show either DDR to show DDR activity, or DDR-
WAIT if an initiator is waiting for DDR completion.
The IR header is preceded by RQE (Request Element) counts:
SVS/OS: nnn RQES; number of free I/O queue elements
SVS: nnn CPQES; number of free channel program queue
elements.
