REP < address × name > < ASID=nn >

REPLACE is a restricted function that displays storage. Authorized
users may replace storage by overtyping.

Defined names are ASCB, ASCVT (ASVT), ASXB, ATTN, AVT, CSCB, CVT, FTCB
(first), GDA, IOCOM, JSTCB, LPA=name, LTCB, MLPA=name, MSRDA (MSER),
OUCB, PFTE, PLPA=name, PVT, SCVT, SVC, SVC=nnn, TCB (last TCB),
UCB=cuu, USERCVT, (for JES2) $HCT, $SVT.

Use ASID=nnn to switch to another address space (note that TSO
sessions usually are swapped out, and can be accessed only if they set
themselves non-swappable with SYSEVENT DONTSWAP or TRANSWAP).

The first address resolved becomes the BASE value. Simple expressions
may be used to position the display, and optionally reset the
base.
REP CVT displays the CVT; entry of -8 displays the prefix (model and
release) on MVS; but entry of .-8 would also set that address as the
new base. PF 7 and 8 position the display up or down in memory.
PF 10 and 11 position two lines up or down. An ampersand
displays the next page, or for a chain display (e.g., CSCB) the next
element. A percent sign changes the display by indirect reference, by
default of the first word displayed on the page.

The display is locked except for authorized users. By default, the
hexadecimal display is unlocked. Changes may be initiated by overtyping
fields to be changed with valid hex; when done on that page, respond
to the prompt (ZAP to alter with CS verify, NOVER to bypass
verfification, or CLEAR to abandon changes). You may enter a TEXT comman
lock the hex portion of the display, and to unlock the text
portion (or place the cursor in the section to be unlocked and hit
ENTER). By default, only printable text may be replaced. When you
need to alter unprintables, issue an UNLOCK to permit replacement,
or switch to HEX mode. Also by default, all text is treated as
UPPER case; issue a LOWER command to support mixed mode.

By default, TEXT is displayed as though it were ECBDIC. When
looking at I/O buffers or similar data, ANSI and ASCII (losely
defined) will convert from ASCII-7. Similarly TERM will treat the data
as asynchronous ASCII with bit order reversed.

The FIND/F command will locate quoted or unquoted text strings.

The LOCATE/L command will locate DC format expressions; e.g.
LOCATE 2x'0',c'WYL' - the search may be restricted by using
START=addr and END=address before the DC specifications. Accepted are C
for text, X for hexadecimal (limit 8 bytes), B (one byte), H, and
F. Xnnn skips without compare; 0H, 0A, 0F, and 0D compare only
on the specified boundaries.
