ZZT

ZZT issues an Exhibit (or with / or # prefix, and MVS) command. It was
written to save me tim issuing a repetitive command. It was assembled
with plenty of ZAP space (starting at offset 03C in the text
record), and could be used for another command. For more extensice
cusomized commands, see the XTR functions.
