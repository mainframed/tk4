TEST <name>

The TEST routine is a debugging tool for checking out Display
module code. Provided the region is large enough, it may also
be used from a normal CRT to display information which does not
fit in the assigned screen area.

"name" is one of DA, DQ, DR, IR, MR, OF, ON, PA and ZZ.

If the "name" operand is omitted, all available functions will
be invoked. The screen layout is the default supplied with
Exhibit, and may not match your normal display.
