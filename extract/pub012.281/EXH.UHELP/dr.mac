The DR function displays the numbers of unanswered console
replies. It also displays, right justified, the text of the
highest pending reply

When more than 80 bytes are allocated to the function, then any older
pending replies are displayed underneath the highest one.

The function additionally checks the number of message buffers in use;
if the number exceeds 75%, or fewer than 10 buffers are free, a
message is placed prior to the "IDs:" text. For OS, the text is
either *WQE HANG* or *WQES LOW*; for JES2 it is *CMB HANG* or *CMBS
LOW*. If any of these appears, do not use the EXHIBIT terminal for
command input (/ or #) to avoid hanging it; use the CON, DCO or $CON
functions to determine the reason for the delay or hang.

If the RING command has been issued, then only those replies activate
the option for which the requesting task is in storage (not
rolled out) and is waiting for a reply. Tasks which have been rolled
out or which are not waiting for a reply will not cause a ring.
