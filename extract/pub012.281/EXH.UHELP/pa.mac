+----------------------------------------+
The PA display shows the current system paging rate in Pages
per Second, and the pages on the Paging Supervisor queues. In
addition, it shows the number of pages short/term fixed,
long/term fixed, and assigned to System Queue Area (a
consolidated figure is shown for SQA and LSQA).
AV designates the number of pages on the available queue.
These may be assigned as required without performing a page
steal.
H designates the number of pages on the HOLD queue. These
pages have been recently assigned and will not be stolen while
other pages remain.
S/T designates short/term fixed pages. These cannot be paged
out, but are expected to be released in the near future.
L/T designates long/term fixed pages. These cannot be paged
out, and are expected to remain fixed for a minimum of several
seconds.
SQA designates the number of pages assigned to SQA and LSQA.
SQA and LSQA pages cannot be paged out, but LSQA pages are
released whenever the owning job is swapped out.
R* designates the pages in the "Referenced-Unchanged" queue.
They had been referenced since the last time their storage
protect keys were checked, but have not been changed since
being paged in.
RC designates the pages in the "Referenced-Changed" queue.
They had been referenced since the last time their storage
protect keys were checked, and have been changed since being

protect keys were checked, and have not been changed since
being paged in.

protect keys were checked, but have been changed since being
