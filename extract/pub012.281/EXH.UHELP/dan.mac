DAN displays count fields of disk tracks, and assists in analyzing
alternate track assignments, R0 errors, etc.

Invokation is made using the data set parameters or volume
specification as for other disk functions.

The display contains three fixed fields for each track :
Field 1 - Home Address record
  First byte -       01 - alternate track
                     02 - defective track with assigned alternate
                     03 - defective alternate with alternate
                     04 - CE track
        Others - cccchhhh track address
Field 2 - Record 0 count field
        Four bytes - cccchhhh of current or alternate track
        Others - IBM standard 00000008 (eight byte data field)
Field 3 - Record 0 data field
        Access method dependent; may repeat address, contain track
capacity or track balance, number of records, and flags.
Fields 4-n - low order field of Record 1-n count fields          First
byte - record number (hex)          Second byte - key length (hex)
         Others - data length (hex) or 'EOF' for zero data length

Following display of a full screen, an ENTER will continue formatting;
an ampersand will skip to the next track. CCHH=cccchhhh or
TTR=hexttr may be used to reposition. After an error message, the TTR=
and CCHH= options are the only replies which allow a continued
display; any other response will be interpreted as discrete command
input.
