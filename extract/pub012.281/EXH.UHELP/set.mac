SET < HOLD × RESET > Unprivileged
SET < LOOP=time > < PFn=text...> < GLOBAL > Unlock/Password
SET < SYSTEM,SECON,MAIN,PRIME,FAIL,NOFAIL > KEY mode
< PSWD,NOPSWD,KEYS,NOKEYS >

The SET command may be used to display the text for all Program
Function and Program Attention keys; current settings of the
Privilege flags; HOLD mode status and time interval for LOOP
mode.
Any user may specify HOLD, which causes the CRT to stay in HOLD
mode on any interrupt. A specification of RESET changes all
privilege flags, LOOP time and WAIT time (NOHOLD) back to
normal.
A user with limited privileges (UNLock or PASsword) may in
addition set :
LOOP=seconds delay time for LOOP mode, from 1 to 650 seconds.
GLOBAL - keep current privileges until RESET.
PAn=text PFn=text CANCEL=text CLEAR=text TEST=text
These operands may be used to modify the internal text
used by EXHBCOMM in response to a Program Function Key or
Program Attention interrupt. The text is limited to five
bytes, and must be quoted if it contains blanks or commas.
The change is made in storage only, and does not change
the default definitions on disk or those used by other
EXHIBIT tasks.
Additional functions are available to users with KEY
privileges :
SYSTEM will set HOLD mode and KEY privilege flags globally;
i.e. on any subsequent interrupt KEY and HOLD mode will be set
automatically until they are cancelled with a "SET RESET"
command. This is intended to make for easier operation when
the machine is dedicated for system's use over extended
periods.
The remaining KEY mode operations are intended for EXHIBIT
debugging only, and may cause problems if used otherwise.
SECON sets secondary console mode, MAIN sets MAIN task and
primary console mode, PRIME sets primary console mode and turns
off MAIN task and secondary console flags. FAIL sets the KEY
module to permit only a single try for UNLock, PASsword and
KEY; NOFAIL resets to two tries. PSWD forces Password input on
any switch from display to conversational mode; NOPSWD resets
to previous status. KEYS restricts the CRT to use of Attention
and Function keys (unless unlocked - PAS should be defined for
at least one Key to permit unlocking); NOKEYS resets to
previous mode.
