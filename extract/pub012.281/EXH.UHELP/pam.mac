PAM

PAM (Printer Authorization Matrix) supports the customization of a
real 3274 control unit, from the CRT at the xx0 address. Other
devices or control units may result in I/O errors or fatal hangs.

A screen is presented that allows the user to customize which
printer on the control unit will process a screen print command,
whether the printer is to be addressable by software, and allows for
customization by linking (arbitrary classes) between terminals and
printers.
