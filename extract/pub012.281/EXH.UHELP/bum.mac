BUMP <hexadd×keyword>

The BUMP routine is a sub-function of the DUMP program. Input
parameters are identical to those for DUMP, only the routine's behaviour
differs somewhat.

Whenever BUMP has completed formatting one page of information, it
goes into a three-second (LOOP time) WAIT. At this time the top of
screen line will show "LOOP >" indicating BUMP mode. If an attention
is not issued during this interval, then BUMP will display the
next page of information. For a Chain request, the next element on
the chain is formatted; for other functions, the next successive
storage locations are shown.

When no further information can be formatted (end of chain or top of
storage reached), then the LOOP message is replaced by the standard
YES message and control reverts to command input mode.

If during the Wait interval ENTER is issued, then processing proceeds
to the next page without delay; any input other than ENTER
cancels BUMP mode and will be processed as normal input.
