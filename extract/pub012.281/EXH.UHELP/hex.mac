DEC { expression }
HEX { expression }

DEC and HEX provide a simple integer arithmetic calculator. Use /HELP
to get a list of commands.

Expressions may be written as a sequence of constants or variables
separated by an operator, or in assignment form of variable name
followed by an equal sign and the expression.

Hexadecimal values beginning with a-f must be preceded by a 0. Integer
values in HEX mode must be followed by a period; hexadecimal values
in decimal mode must be followed by an h (lower case input is
folded to upper case)

+   addition
-   subtracts second from first operand
*   multiplication
/   divides second into first operand
//  produces the remainder of the division
**  raises the first operand to a positive power
%   integer division (same as / in this routine)
×   inclusive OR
&&  exclusive OR
&   AND
^   unary NOT
Note that two-character operands are changed to a single character
internally; these may also be used in input. ** is › and && is | and //
is #

Please note that integer calculation produces sometimes unexpected
results, and evaluation sequence is critical.
8 / 5 * 4 yields 4, but 8 * 4 / 5 yields 6
Parentheses are not supported.

Hitting ENTER repeats the previous input line.
