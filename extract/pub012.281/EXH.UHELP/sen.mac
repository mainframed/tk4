SENd <TEXT=message>

The SEND command permits a privileged user to issue a
message displayed on CRTs using the same LPA group member. The
command is not accepted unless the installation has supplied
the appropriate EXHRxxxy module in the Link-Pack area, and the
CRT from which the command is issued is using the module. On
all CRTs using the same LPA group module, the message is
displayed on the regular display screen on the first completely
blank line found on the screen.

SEN issued without parameters displays the address of the LPA
module, and the current message.

SEN text= resets it to blanks.

TEXT='message' may be used to change the message.
The message is limited to 73 characters,
the length actually supplied is not checked.
