PIO mask

The Pending I/O function lists all Active, Pending
and Queued I/O (unlike RQE, which lists queued I/O only).
The function, if used without input, will list all I/O other
than for Tele-Processing. If TP I/O is wanted also, then a
"mask" value should be supplied.

The "mask" value may be used to display I/O for specific
addresses and address ranges only; e.g. PIO 1 will display
channel 1 requests only, PIO x3 will display I/O to any unit on
any channel having a control unit address of x3x. The mask may
be a maximum of three digits; any valid hexadecimal digit will
be used in a comparison test, any other digit will be used for
an address position only, without a comparison.

The display is as documented for RQE, but some additional
entries are made in the RQE address field. In place of an RQE
address, the display may show:
PEND I/O was issued - not yet complete
BUSY Unit or Control Unit is busy; I/O is delayed.
PERR error routines in control
