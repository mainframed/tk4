ALTER hexadr / verify string / replace string

Under MVS and later systems, ALTer only works on the current address
space. Please use the REPlace command instead. The ALTer function
replaces data in storage. It requires UNLOCK prior to use.
"hexadr" is the starting byte address to be patched.
"verify string" represents verification data.
"replace string" supplies the replacement data.

The two strings may be mixed EBCDIC and hex data; after conversion
they may not exceed sixteen bytes each. The two strings must be of
the same length after translation. The strings are assembled out
of hex digits (must occur in pairs), and character strings
surrounded by quotes or apostrophes. Embedded delimiters must be
doubled; e.g. 'AB"C' or 'AB''C' but not 'AB'C'
For example, after translation the following strings are equivalent:
'ABC234'
C1'BC2'F3"4"
'A'C2'C'F2'3'F4
C1C2C3F2F3F4
Blanks must not be used except to separate complete strings, and
within quoted character strings. Commas in Hex text are ignored;
commas inside a Character string are processed.

Result of a successful replace is a partial storage dump, starting
sixteen bytes lower than the ALTer address. Unsuccessful requests are
indicated by self-explanatory error messages.

When the ALTER command is issued from DUMP/BUMP, then the patch
address may be specified as a displacement relative to the "BASE"
value set in DUMP. For example:
 DUMP CVT
 ALTER -4 / '218A' / '218B'
