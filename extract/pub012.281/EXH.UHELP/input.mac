Input processing for Conversational Functions
A. CRT Input Option

From a 2260, an Attention is issued by pushing the ENTER button
while the SHIFT key is depressed. On a 3270, just using ENTER
will signal the Attention. This process is referred to as
ENTER in the rest of this description. You may enter a request
after the "YES >" message appears on the top of the Screen.

The Input mode is cancelled by either:
i. No reply for 30 seconds (see HOLD mode)
ii. One or more blanks, followed by ENTER in any mode, or
just ENTER when a new command is expected. Note that some
functions require input of END or $END before they
relinquish control.
Basic commands are:
HOLD - changes default delay from 30 seconds to 10 minutes.
See i. above.
LOCK - disable privileged functions. Refer to the KEY,
PASSWORD, and UNLOCK commands for further details. This
command also restores the short (30 second) wait mode.
/ text - OS command input
# text - protected command input
text - conversational module request - see following write-
ups.
$text - JES2 conversational module request.
@text - request for privileged system functions.
*text - (planned) JES3 conversational module request
8text - (planned) JES3 conversational module request
Descriptions of the available conversational modules are gotten
by typing the command name.

3270 Input Processing
The 3270 has several keys which signal Attentions in addition
to the ENTER key. If only the ENTER key is used, then
processing is identical to the 2260.
Several keys signal an Attention, but ignore input:
CANCEL (PA2) - Exit from the current function, and return to
the top level input mode ("YES >" message). From top
level input mode performs a LOCK.
PA1 - Sets HOLD mode.
CLEAR - Clears the screen and returns to top level input
mode; or, when some special functions are running, re-
initializes (e.g. ALLocate).
PA3 - Unassigned, not available on all keyboards.

Text input is never accepted from the keyboard unless a message
such as YES or MORE is on the screen. To switch from Display
mode to Input mode, only an Attention key may be used; data
also typed in will be ignored.
The following keys substitute for the listed function, and
accept data from the keyboard (except from normal display
mode):
ENTER - same as 2260 Shift/ENTER sequence
PFK1 - $F PFK2 - $I PFK3 - $JOB
PFK4 - $N PFK5 - $U PFK6 - $MSG
PFK7 - CON PFK8 - STOR PFK9 - ENQ
PFK10 - PIO PFK11 - Q PFK12 - U D,T
Test-Request - invokes the task summary display code with a
"TAS *" command. EXHIBIT supports this key exactly like a
Program Function Key with full data input capability.
Under TSO, the key used to switch to/from Full Screen mode is
not available. By default this is the CLEAR key.
Functions invoked by Attention and Function keys may vary at
various terminals, and are installation dependent. Use the SET
command to get a list of the options.

3270 Restrictions
INSERT mode will not work (locks the keyboard), unless a
portion of the input area is cleared (Erase EOF, Erase INPUT or
DELETE keys); however, the Erase keys will also clear the
entire screen.
Due to programming restrictions, input will be read only
between the start of the input field (>_) and the byte
preceding the cursor position. If text is entered, and the
cursor is backspaced to the beginning of the field
( the ">_" ), then the input will be treated as a request of
all blanks.
Warning : The RESET key must never be used to reset the
keyboard while a previous input request is being processed. If
you do use RESET, then in the rare case of an EXHIBIT abend,
you may crash the system. RESET should be used only when the
keyboard locks due to data input (into a protected field) or an
INSERT.
Note that several 2260 graphics do not exist on the 3270. For
input, the "Error Symbol" is replaced by a quote ("); for
output it may be displayed as a quote, an @ sign or as a blank.
The Start symbol is shown as a > sign.

3278 Considerations
Preliminary support for the 3278 does not provide for 24
Function keys; instead, keys 13 to 24 are treated as keys 1 to
12, respectively. To facilitate entry of JES2 commands, the
cent sign is accepted as a dollar sign for JES2 functions; e.g.
ÖI is treated as $I.

3066 Processing
The 3066 (or 5450) Operator CRT is supported in 3270 simulation
mode. The screen is written to the top 34 lines of the
display; the bottom line is reserved for input. Input is
processed similar to an OS console, i.e. input may be entered
while the display is updating. The input will be read only
when the ENTER or CANCEL keys are pressed. Input text will be
processed from the left portion of the input line to the cursor
only; characters after the cursor are ignored. The 3066 does
not have Program Function or Attention keys; to permit easier
use, PFK entries may be simulated by typing the key number, one
blank, then the input text; e.g. typing 5 alone would get the
PFK5 response (normally $U).

General notes on the Input Option:

Each function may have a one to eight byte name; but only the
first three characters (first three after $, @, * for special
requests) are significant (e.g. UNLOCK may be requested by
UNL. An @, *, 8 and $ are an integral part of the command.

Each command verb is followed by at least one blank; for most
functions one or more operands follow to make the request
specific. For most functions this "operand" is optional, but
some functions require it. Some others will not work with an
operand.

Conventions used in the module descriptions:
Items shown in upper case, if used, must be supplied as shown.
Parentheses, commas and periods, when described with optional
parameters, must also be supplied as shown.
Items in lower case represent user supplied parameters.
Items enclosed in brackets < > are optional.
Items enclosed in brackets, and separated by a stroke ×
represent mutually exclusive options; i.e. only one of the
bracketed options may be used.
Items in braces ¯ ò must be supplied; the braces usually
include a × to denote a choice.
An ellipsis " ....." shows that the preceding items may be
repeated.
Since the "TN" train on which this is being printed does not
have all the 2260 graphics, two of the 2260 symbols are
represented as follows
> is used in place of the START symbol.
" is used in place of an Error symbol.

Standard Response messages:
YES > ready for another command
MORE > the current function has MORE data to display;
ENTER will produce the next page, anything else will be
accepted as a command. This does not apply to functions
which require an explicit END or $END to terminate.
LOOP > this message corresponds to MORE, but also indicates
LOOP mode. An ENTER will advance to the next page; any
other input will cancel the LOOP request; if no response
is received within 3 seconds (or the SET LOOP time), then
an ENTER is simulated. Refer to the LOOP command for
details.
UNACCEPTABLE > invalid command input; syntax error in the
verb portion of the command; $ request when JES2 is not
running; */8 when JES3 is not up; or a @ request in locked
mode. Also produced on terminals restricted to KEY only
mode, where use of the ENTER key is restricted.
INVALID OP > an invalid operand, or text with erroneous
syntax follows a valid command verb request.
EXHCname UNAVAILABLE > the requested function "name" is
not available. Check for an incorrectly spelled request.
If the message occurs with correct input, check the
following conditions: is the function documented as
requiring special action (UNLOCK, PASSWORD, etc.); does it
work only from an operator CRT; does it run only under a
specific version of OS; or is it JES2 dependent and JES2
has been stopped or drained ? Otherwise, notify the
systems staff of the problem. Note that some functions
may require more storage than you are currently running
EXHIBIT in; in this case a message is produced to avoid an
804 or 80A abend.
