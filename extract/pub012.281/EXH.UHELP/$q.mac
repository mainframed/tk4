$N < qtype >
$Q < qtype >

$N and $Q scan the JES2 jobqueue. $Q returns a count of the jobs on
each queue; $N returns the job numbers of each job on the queue.
If the jobname is available, then it follows the job number.
*************************$N under MVS acts as $Q*********************
"qtype" specifies which queue or set of queues is to be searched. All
queues are searched if the operand is omitted.
Valid operands are :
  IN    all input queues        OUT    all output queues
  EXEC    jobs sent to OS       RDR    jobs being read
  HOLD    all input jobs being held or delayed
  R/REM     all remote output queues
  INx/OUTx    single input/local queue only
  n/nn/Rnn/REMnnn  all jobs from Remote "n"

Special flags: A queue name may be followed by an asterisk to indicate
that at least one job on the queue is in HOLD QUEUE status ($HA).

$N only: Each queue is displayed with priority values; the priority
*n* is followed by all jobs of that priority. Job on the HOLD
queue (specific hold) is followed by the input class in
parentheses. Job on an output or remote queue, or one in execution, may
followed by an asterisk to show that the job is held; a pound sign to
indicate that it is executing; and a question mark to show both
executing and hold status.

Note also that a job will be shown on a queue until it is completely
processed.
