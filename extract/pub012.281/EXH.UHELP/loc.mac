LOCATE <DSN=×MASK=>dsname/mask
LOCATE <MEM=×MEMBER=>member/mask
LOCATE <VOL=×VOLUME=>serial/mask

The LOCATE function searches for the specified data set or member (or
both) in the system catalog and on resident and mounted disk packs.

The MEM= operand may be used to find a specific member, or all
matching a mask. It may be used with or without a data set name.

MASK=dsname may be used to supply a pattern prefix; the data set name
may contain quotes " or ? to specify mask positions. A * or - are
used for a level match.

Note that unlike other masks used in Exhbit, the data set mask
operates on an index level. LOC HERC01.* searches for data sets with
one level; LOC HERC01.*.* searches for two levels, etc. To search
all levels, use a doubled ampersand: LOC HERC01.**

By default, the search covers only packs that are permanently resident
or which were mounted. The optional VOL= name or mask limits the
volumes searched. E.g., VOL=PUB* searches only volumes beginning with
PUB.

The output contains :
Catalog information (not produced for a mask request).

   Dataset name (displayed only for mask requests)
   Volume serial/type; RACF/Password flags; Creation date; Access date
(where available); tracks and extent information; DCB information.
For multi-volume and unitialized data sets, the next line shows
the volume the data set starts on (or was created on), and the
sequence number.
