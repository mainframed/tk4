ALL is a privileged function for allocating direct access
data sets. ALLocate requires an explicit input of END to
terminate. The input parameters may be supplied on the initial
ALL command, or they may be supplied, one or more at a time, on
subsequent input requests.

ALL .......... parameters as described below

On a full-screen CRT, ALLocate displays a screen with input
fields to specify the request. Mandatory fields are DSN, VOL, SPACE
(type/amount),and VOLUME. DSORG of PS or PO is inferred from SPACE (zero
directory block count. The DCB may be all omitted, or supplied
consistently; i.e., RECFM=U requires a block size, F and V require a rec
length, but will calculate a block size if none specified.

On a line terminal, ALL requires the user to supply one or more
input lines as follows:

    Required parameters
    VOL=volser volume serial to allocate on. This pack must be
available when ALL is issued; caution should be taken that this pack is
not removed while ALLocating.
    DSN=dsname desired data set name; quotes and embedded blanks are
not allowed. A leading ampersand is replaced by the index level
SYS1.
    SPACE=name basically the same format as on a DD card, but ABSTR is
not supported; of the third and fourth positional SPACE
parameters only CONTIG is allowed. A request for zero tracks (Dummy
DSCB) is permitted only when specified as SPACE=(TRK,0) or
SPACE=(CYL,0). If the space contains a directory request, then at a mini
the DCB=DSORG=PO operand must be supplied also.

    Optional parameters
    DCB= same syntax as on a DD card, optional for ALL. The DCB
suboperands LRECL, BLKSIZE, RECFM, etc. may be written without the DCB=
parameter. If it is used, then an extra level of parentheses must be
supplied around the subparameters.
    DSORG= same as on DD card; except IS is not supported. This
parameter is required if SPACE= specifies a directory quantity.
    EXPDT=yyddd expiration date, if desired. Any of the above
parameters may be specified without a value (followed by blanks or a
comma) to clear out the previous value.

    CAT catalog after successful allocation.
    CVOL requests Control VOLume cataloguing. If a CONNECT pointer can
be built, the data set is cataloged on the receiving volume (if
possible); if a CONNECT pointer cannot be built, then ALLocate will try
to catalog the data set on the system residence volume and the
receiving volume. Error messages are issued only for the return code
for the data set cataloguing on the receiving volume.
    NOCAT do not catalog after allocation (default)

    3270 CLEAR key, and INIT or ALL re-initialize the work
area. All previously supplied information is deleted.
If not used, multiple data sets may be allocated by
changing the appropriate parameters only.
    3270 PA1 key - will set HOLD mode without changing the
display; note that HOLD mode is set automatically by the
function.
    Other 3270 keys will function as documented from top level
conversational mode; if used, ALLocate will immediately
exit to the requested function.

Messages:

VERIFY REQUEST - hit ENTER to allocate/catalog; or proceed with more
input.
BAD OPERAND - syntax error in input
MISSING OPERAND - one or more operands required for allocation have
not yet been supplied
CONFLICTING PARMS - information is contradictory, e.g. DSORG=PS with
directory block request
