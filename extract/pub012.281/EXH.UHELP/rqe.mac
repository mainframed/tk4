RQE <*>

The RQE function lists the chain of pending I/O
Request Queue Elements.
A request for RQE * will cause display for "not ready" devices
only, if any. Otherwise all RQEs are shown.

If the display is ended with an END message, then a subsequent
ENTER will restart the scan from the beginning, otherwise
formatting continues with the next available RQE.

The display shows :
RQE hex address of the RQE
LINK next RQE address or hex 'FFFF'
UCB hex UCB address
*-flag an asterisk if the device is not ready
CUU device address in EBCDIC
VOLSER the volume serial, if available
IOB, DEB, TCB hex addresses of control blocks
JOBNAME the jobname, if any

Note: RQE shows only Queued Requests; to get all active and
pending requests, use the PIO function.
