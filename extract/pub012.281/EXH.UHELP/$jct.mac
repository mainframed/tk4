$JCT jobname × number <,options...>

This function displays information from the JES2 Job Control table for
the requested job. Note that the information may be incomplete
for a job in OS execution.

The retrieval options are similar to the JOB function, except DSN and
DSN=ds# are not honored

No data are displayed unless the requesting CRT is set to some
privilege level (e.g. Primary CRT, UNLock, PASsword, etc.).
