This module displays the "cuu" of any device (tape or disk) for
which the system has issued a Mount message; these will also
show up as Intervention Requests for non-AVR mounts. When
available, the volume serial is displayed with the address in
the form cuu/volser . For mount messages not specifying an
address (e.g. M 2400, Scrtch) the display shows AVR followed
by the device type(s), e.g. TAPE, 2314, 3330, etc. The next
line, if AVR is displayed on the first line, will show the
addresses which may be used to satisfy the request. This
second line is not shown either if no AVR mount is pending, or
if the space allocation for MR does not permit it.
