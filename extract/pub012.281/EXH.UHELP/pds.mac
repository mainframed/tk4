PDS <DSN=>dsname<(mask)×,NAME=mask><,VOL=volser> <,TTR=hexad>
PDS *.ddname<(mask)×,NAME=mask> <,TTR=hexad>

Routine PDS displays the directory of a Partitioned Data Set.

"dsname" is the required parameter specifying the data set to be
formatted. DOS names with embedded blanks or special
characters are not supported.
The form "*.ddname" may be used to access an entry via the
TIOT; this may be used under TSO, and using EXORCIST, or to
access the STEPLIB of the running task.
VOL=volser specifies the disk; this parameter may be omitted
if the data set is cataloged on the volume to be scanned.
TTR=hexad may be used to start display at a specific block in
the directory; this will result in incorrect directory block
counts (if any).
If the member name "mask" is omitted, the entire directory will
be displayed. If "mask" is specified, it will result in a scan
for a matching name in the directory. Valid characters in the
eight byte mask are the letters, numeric digits, the special
characters #, @, and $, trailing blanks, and a plus sign. The
plus sign allows retrieval of SVCLIB members containg a byte of
hex 'C0'.
For 3278 and later devices, x'C0' is displayed as a left brace, which
may be used in requests
The "mask" may contain a question mark to match that position, and an
asterisk for a terminal match. For example, PDS SYS1.PROCLIB(????CLG)
would find ASMFCLG, while (???F*) would retrieve all ASMF members.

PDS will perform I/O in either of two forms; if a member name
is used and starts with an error symbol (or quote), or no
member selection is made, then the directory is read
sequentially. If a member name is used and starts with a valid
character, then "SCAN mode" is used to read the directory only
partially (using keys). In scan mode, directory block counts
will not be shown.

The header line of the display will repeat the DSName, the
"volser", and show the "ttr" of the last block read. Using
this "ttr" or the "ttr" minus one should repeat the current
page on the next request.

For a PDS not produced by the Linkage Editor, the display will
list the member name, an A for an Alias entry, the TTR of the
first record, and, right-adjusted, the SSI information, if any.

For a Load Module Library, the display contains the member
name, an A for an Alias entry, the TTR of the first record, the
Entry Point address, the module length in hex, the TTR of the
first Text record, and the Linkage Editor assigned module
attributes. If SSI information is available, it will be
displayed on the right hand side of the line.

The last entry of the display is :
*** END FILE *** mmm BLOCKS FREE, OUT OF nnn (Read mode)
*** END FILE *** *** END OF SCAN *** (Scan mode)

Whenever the MORE message is displayed, PDS processing may be
modified by the user by supplying new input.
NAME= MEMBER= MEM= PDS=
Restart the previous request using the new member name or mask
specified (and/or switch to PDS mode from DSx).
DSN= DSL= DSW= DAS= DIS= ZAP= UPD= EDI=
invoke the specified display function using the new member or
mask specified (or the original requested name/mask if only a
function is given). ZAP= will be rejected unless the user is
in KEY mode (EDI and UPD are special ZAP functions).
END terminates the function.

Error Messages:
DATASET NOT PARTITIONED
VOLUME NOT FOUND IN CATALOG
DATASET NOT ON VOLUME OR VOLUME NOT MOUNTED
CCHH VALUES INVALID

*** PROCESSING ERROR IN EXHCXDEB ***
Possibilities: UCB was for tape rather than disk.
VOLSER not found (pack was unloaded).
DSCB bad or unreadable, etc.
I/O Error message:
>>> I/O ERROR ecb ttrn mbbcchhr status ccwad sense <<<
This message is produced in response to some I/O error
condition. The displayed information is similar to that
displayed in the system IEA000I message.
Two special conditions should be recognized as non-errors:
If the "ecb" code is zero, the message indicates that the I/O
was aborted because the disk pack was removed from the system
or the operator cancelled EXHIBIT.
If the "ccwad" is zero, and the "ecb" is hex '42', then an
extent boundary was reached. This situation may be found in
place of an END FILE if the data set does not have space for
writing the EOF record.

Note that a standard Intervention Request message will be
issued if the disk is physically taken out of ready. EXHIBIT
will go into a WAIT state until some pack is readied at that
address.
Additional information is available from the DIR command, which
also permits authorized users to modify the directory.
