VAT < PVT × STO × PUB >
VAT < 2311 × 2314 × 3330 × 3350 × 3375 × 3380 × 3390 × 9345 >
VAT < ucbname × device number × UCB=cuu × DEV=dev# >
VAT < Volser=mask >

The VAT function lists one or more DASD entries. The display shows the
unit name (cuu) or the device number (on systems having more than
sixteen channels); the volume serial; UCBSTAT byte, and its
explanation; the attribute (private, storage, or public); and the number
of users having the device allocated. For shared DASD, the
device number (or cuu) is followed by a colon.

The display may be made selective by specifying one or more attributes
(PVT,PUB,STO), and a DASD device type. Note that double-size 3330s may b
requested as 3331, 333D, or 3330-1.

A single drive may be displayed by requesting the cuu address or the
device number.

One or more drives may be selected by a volume serial or a volume
serial mask. Use a question mark for a single position not to be
tested, and an asterisk to end the comparison. For example, VAT
V=MVS* would list MVSCAT, MVSDLB, and MVSRES, while VAT VOL=????01
would list CBT001, PUB001, SRC001, WORK01, etc.
