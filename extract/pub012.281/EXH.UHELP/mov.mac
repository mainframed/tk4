COPY
MOVE

COPY is a full-screen command to copy data sets or members. Unlike the
commands in the DSN and ZAP family, data sets will have their access
dates and change flags set.
MOVE has not been implemented, and acts as COPY.

To copy an entire PDS, use an asterisk (*) in both member name fields.
At present it will not produce a sequential file from a pds, or
a PDS from a sequential file. The current code uses IEBCOPY, so
is limited by its restrictions.

The current version does not support copying a member of a PDS to the
same PDS, even with a new name. Data set compress in place is
planned for the near future.
