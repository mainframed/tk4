ATTACH cuu { cuu } { ,cuu } { cuu-cuu } { cuu:cuu }
DETACH cuu { cuu } { ,cuu } { cuu-cuu } { cuu:cuu }

The UCB has a bit (UCBNALOC in UCBFL5) that indicates that the IBM
Customer Engineer is running diagnostic tests (OLTEP or OLTSEP) on the
device, and it is not to be considered for allocation.

Several installations have used this bit to generate spare devices
(usually DASD) whenever they do an I/O gen, then zap the bit in the
nucleus, thus having additional devices ready for installation without
having to do another I/O gen.

ATTach and DETach without operands show the units currently
unavailable. The operands are cuu address, blank or comma separated, or
range of devices with a start and end cuu separated by slash or
colon.

Care must be taken which and how many units are made unavailable. For
example, MVS under Hercules is frequently generated with four tape
drives (480-483, or 400:403). If you want all your mounts to go to
480, you could issue DETach 481-483; however, any jobs that need
two or more tape drives would then fail with a JCL error, or with
an error code on dynamic allocation.
