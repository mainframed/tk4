VINDEX volser <,MASK=dsnmask>

VINDEX displays a disk VTOC in ascending sequence by absolute
disk address. The MASK= operand restricts the display to those
data sets whose name starts with the specified mask.

Error messages are shown in the VTOC function description.

Without the MASK= option the display includes an analysis of
available space; diagnosed are space missing from the Format 5
DSCB, overlapping allocation, and SPLIT Cylinder space not
allocated. This information is produced under the assumption
that the VTOC is not altered during the display processing; if
any error messages are shown, retry the display when the system
is quiesced to assure that the diagnosed error is not due to a
change in the volume during display.
