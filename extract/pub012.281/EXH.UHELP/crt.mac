CRT < message >

CRT loops through all CRTs defined to the system, reports status of
allocated ones, and tries to write a message to unallocated ones. The
function was originally used to verify the device address when labels
fell off, or users switched cables around.

Under Hercules, the function may be useful to check that the device is
connected correctly, and is usable.
