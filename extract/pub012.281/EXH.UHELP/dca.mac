DCALC

This is an old desk calculator program, sorely in need of repair. For
one thing, it does not recognize unary plus or minus. It does
support decimals and a limited number of built-in functions. Type
HELP to get a list.

For integer calculations, with hex and decimal results, use the
DEC and HEX commands. These also support Boolean operators.
