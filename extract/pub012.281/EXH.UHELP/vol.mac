VOL volser < ,dsnmask >

VOL produces a condensed listing of a direct access volume.
The disk specified by "volser" must be available, preferably
Mounted.

The display gives a free disk space summary on the first line,
providing the Format 5 DSCB information is available. For DOS
packs whose space has not been computed during OS use an
appropriate message is issued, normal formatting continues.

For each data set on the volume the program will show:
The data set name, data set organization, number of tracks
allocated, number of extents, record format, record length and
blocksize. If the data set name is sufficiently short, and the
data set has PS or PO organization, and the DS1LSTAR field is
available, then the percentage of space used is displayed
immediately preceding the space allocated.

The display may be made selective by specifying a "dsnmask";
only those data sets matching the mask will be shown.
