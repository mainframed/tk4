TMP <TSO command>

The TMP command attaches a TSO subtask (IKJEFT01) and sends a command
to it, if one was specified. If no command was typed,
conversational mode allows commands to be entered consecutively. TMP is
accepted only when Exhibit is running as a TSO command.
***WARNING*** This function works under MVT and SVS only. Under MVS
and later systems the commands (no CLISTs nor REXX modules) are
executed correctly, but when the TSO session is ended, the task abends
with 0C4; this is a documented IBM restriction.
