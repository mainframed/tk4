BLDL

The BLDL function displays the contents of the resident BLDL list
built by the Nucleus Initialization Program at IPL time.

For an IBM list, the display shows basic directory entry information,
as SVC 18 does not maintain staticstics. Alias names are
preceded by an asterisk

In systems with dynamic BLDL installed, the display shows module
names, location, and the use count similar to the listing produced
by DYNABLDL (usually installed with PROC DBSTART).
