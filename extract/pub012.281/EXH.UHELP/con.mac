CON <cuu×number> , < * > , < MSG=prefix, > , < ID=name >
MCO < * > , < MSG=prefix, >

The CONsole function prints current, unprocessed console messages. It
may be used to keep the system running following System Console
malfunctions, or if the Consoles are backed up. Only the first 80 bytes
each message are displayed; for D A and related requests
(multi-line WTO), only the message header is shown.

When the MCO command (Master COnsole) is issued, and the current
master console is a CRT, its contents will be displayed with an
automatic update every (LOOP=) 5 seconds. Use PF3 or PA1 to exit.

CON with no operands lists all messages.

* requests only action messages to be listed

MSG=prefix will display only messages with the specified prefix (up to
8 bytes) ; for instance CON MSG=IE would retrieve messages
starting with IEA, IEC, IEE etc.

In a system with DIDOCS consoles, messages may be retrieved as they
are currently displayed on the screen. Use CON cuu (console unit
address) or CON number (logical console number, e.g. 1 is first
console, etc.); display responses (e.g. D A, D U, etc.) are not shown.
