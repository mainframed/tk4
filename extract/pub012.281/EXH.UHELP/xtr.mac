XTR <name>

The XTR function permits convenient entry of predefined OS, JES2 or
EXHIBIT commands. Entry of XTR presents a page listing Program
Function and Attention keys and a command that will be executed when
the corresponding key is pressed. An asterisk after the key name
indicates "conversational mode", the text will be displayed prior to
execution. The text listed will usually contain one or more fields with
question marks - to use these, enter one value (or character string),
separated by commas, for each field prior to using the corresponding
key.

The commands displayed by XTR are obtained from a module with the name
EXHKCcuu, where "cuu" is the CRT address, or from EXHKDFLT. Unless your
CRT is in protected mode and the XTR key was assigned to an
Attention rather than Function key, you may specify a "name" of the
form "Ccuu" and "DFLT" to obtain a command list other than the
default.

If you wish to terminate the request rather than execute a command,
use END to exit.
