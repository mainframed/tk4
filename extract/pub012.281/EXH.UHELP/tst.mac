TSTERM

The TST command is used for Exhibit debugging. When invoked,
it shows the terminal character set for hex values 40 through
FF. It then solicits input from the terminal. Input is
processed without going through normal translation and editing,
and is displayed on the screen in hex and EBCDIC as read (up to
256 bytes). The function terminates when the input contains
the character string 'end' anywhere in the input buffer; the
text may be upper or lower case.
