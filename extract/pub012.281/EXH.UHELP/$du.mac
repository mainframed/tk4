$U <devname>

This function displays JES2 Unit status. Only those units for which
information is available are displayed; for instance, a tape reader whic
has not been started, or an internal reader which was drained,
will be omitted from the display.

For other units, the display shows the JES2 name of the unit, the OS
unit address (preceded by an asterisk if the unit is not ready),
and unit type dependent information. For a Reader, Printer and
Punch processing a job, the job number and the job name are
displayed if available. For remote lines, the active remote functions
are listed.

Note that for a Printer/Punch displaying a jobname, there is
insufficient room for the status field; in this case the status is shown
only if the unit is DRAINING; this condition is indicated by a
dollar sign in the last display position. A "not" sign (^) preceding
the form indicates that a separator will not be produced; a comma
that it will.

For HASP II Version 4 and JES2, the Printer format is different. The
first character after the form is the first byte of the UCS
parameter, the second character is the first letter of the FCB
parameter. This field is followed by one to five output classes.
