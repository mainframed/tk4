The SMCA function formats the System Management Facilities
Control table, which contains SMF related information.
The first four lines display current and IPL options; the
remaining lines status of the SMF data sets (SYS1.MANX and
SYS1.MANY). The first displayed data set is the current one (if
recording is active). The information includes the data set
name, the volume, and usage information.
