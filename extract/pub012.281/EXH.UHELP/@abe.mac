@ABEND/@013 is a privileged system function for Abending tasks. It
requires KEY to unlock.

ABEND/013 provide a semi-privileged entry to this function. The
request is honored only if issued from the Primary CRT, which must
have been unlocked with UNL or PASsword, and if the task to be
abended (by Job/Start name) exists in a table built into this module.

ASID specifies the number of the address space to be used. "tcbaddr"
specifies a valid TCB address in that asdress space. Optional
parameters are the completion code, specified as either a decimal User
Completion Code (USER=), or as a hex System Abend Code (SYS=). DUMP
requests a storage dump; STEP requests a STEP abend instead of just a
task abend; EVEN requests that the abend be issued even if the
task is already in abend.
