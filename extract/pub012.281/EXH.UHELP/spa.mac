SPACE < volser × mask × SYSDA × & >
SPU < volser × mask × SYSDA × & >

The SPACE function displays "available" disk space on all
mounted disks, a specific disk, or a group of disks
(mask×SYSDA×&).
The SPU function performs similar to the SPACE command, but
displays used storage

The program invokes LSPACE (SVC 78) to obtain the space
information in EBCDIC. LSPACE will not display a volume for
which error recovery is in progress, or for which an Unload or
Vary Offline command has been issued. The LSPACE output is
reformatted prior to display; free tracks in excess of a
cylinder are added to the cylinder count. If LSPACE returns a
non-zero return code, then in place of the space information
the message "LSPACE ERROR - RC xx" is shown.

SPACE supports LOOP mode.

A request of SPACE without operands will list all possible disk
packs; a request of the form "SPACE volser" will retrieve
information for a single volume. A request with a volume mask
will list all volumes matching the mask, and display
PUBLIC/STORAGE summaries for the displayed volume(s). A
request of the form "SPACE &" or "SPACE SYSDA" will show detail
and summary listings of available Public and Storage disk space
by device type.
Note : Classification of Storage and Public space is made by
attribute bits in the UCB (Unit Control Block); thus the
displayed space may exceed that used by allocation if volumes
with the Public/Storage attribute are mounted on drive address
which are not defined in the Device Name and Mask table for
this use.

The information for each volume shows :
Volume location (cuu) and volume-serial
Total free space (cyl,trk)
Number of free extent
Largest contiguous free area (cyl,trk)
For mask and SYSDA requests the bottom of the screen will show
the summarized information by device type and attribute.
