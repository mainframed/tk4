CVT <fieldname>

The CVT module formats the contents of the Communications Vector
Table. It is intended for systems' use. When an optional name is
specified, the display will start with that field, if the name is found.
Note that a specified request may be specified in three formats, e.g.,
CVT CVTDCB, CVT DCB, or CVTDCB

Optionally the field name may be followed by a special character.
"name." displays memory starting at the CVT's name field. "name*"
displays memory starting at the contents of the field (24-bit).
"name%" treats the field address as a 31-bit value and displays that
when in AMODE 31 (available under MVS/380 and later systems).
The module transfers control to REPlace when the terminal is a
full-screen CRT with at least 12 lines, otherwise it invokes DUMP.
