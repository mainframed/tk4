SIG
SIGNOFF

SIGNOFF, without operands, resets all privileges and returns the
session to unprivileged. If SECURITY in the options data set is
STRICT, RAKF, or RACF, then any subsequent attention will bring up
the signon screen again

SIG presents a sign-on menu, requesting a user id, a password, and an
optional account number. When the SECURITY setting is RACF or RAKF, a
RACHECK is issued to verify the user and privileges. When RACF or
RAKF are unavailable, or when SECURITY is set to STRICT, SIG
checks SYS1.UADS and uses TSO remapped privileges.

When SECURITY is set to NONE or LAX, this routine invokes the UADS
verification. If it is not used, then the user needs to use either the K
or PASsword interface to access restricted functions.
