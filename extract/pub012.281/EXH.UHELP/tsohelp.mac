EXHIBIT under TSO

The majority of EXHIBIT functions are supported under most
types of TSO terminals.
Prior to invoking EXHIBIT, the user must provide a DD for the
EXHIBIT Load Module data set (SYS1.EXHIBIT at most
installations). This data set may be allocated in the LOGON
PROCedure :
//LOADLIB DD DSN=SYS1.EXHIBIT,DISP=SHR
or dynamically using the ALLOCATE command :
ALLOC FILE(LOADLIB) DATASET('SYS1.EXHIBIT') SHR

Allocation of a SYSUDUMP DD SYSOUT= is recommended to help
diagnose errors. If the PRINT function is to be used, then a
DD needs to be allocated :
//EXHPRINT DD SYSOUT=?,SPACE=(... or
ALLOC FILE(EXHPRINT) SYSOUT
Dataset attributes are forced to RECFM=VBA, LRECL=137,
BLKSIZE=689; user specified attributes are overridden.
After file allocation, the 3270 user should switch to
FULL SCREEN mode using the installation defined key (IBM
default is the CLEAR key). EXHIBIT is then invoked specifying
the command EXHIBIT or an installation provided alias
(e.g. EXH). Note that a prompter for the EXORCISE version of
EXHIBIT is distributed with the name GHOST; if supported by
your installation, it will provide the required DD allocations.

The TSO version of EXHIBIT behaves as documented for a local
3270 with the following exceptions :
The key used by TCAM/TSO to switch to and from FULL SCREEN mode
cannot be used by EXHIBIT. Default is the CLEAR key.
The TEST-REQ key may or may not function as documented
depending on whether TCAM was generated with the TOTE option.
The PA1 key (or BREAK/ATTN from non-3270 terminals) is
supported as in the batch version, except that an attention
issued while a previous attention is unprocessed results in an
EXHIBIT B22 abend. For non-3270 terminals, attention issued
during a write to the terminal results in suppression of output
up to and not including the next prompt message (e.g. YES,
MORE, etc.).
Normal display loop processing has been disabled; anytime the
display buffer is written, a wait for terminal input is forced.

LOOP mode does not work correctly for 3270 terminals, and works
for non-3270 terminals only if the interval is sufficiently
long to permit TCAM to read and process input between EXHIBIT
writes. The default LOOP time has been set to 10 seconds.
As in the batch version, EXHIBIT may be terminated by an
operator using the OS STOP and CANCEL commands; CANCEL may
cause problems and is not recommended. The terminal user may
stop EXHIBIT by using END or ABEND. ABEND results in
termination with a system abend code of B22 and a dump; END
results in normal termination.
The MODify or F command from the terminal supports the LAYOUT=
subcommand, but does not support the RING and FREE requests.
The PRINT command has been replaced by a Print function. If a
DD for EXHPRINT has been allocated, the user may obtain a copy
of all EXHIBIT terminal I/O upon enabling the PRINT option :
PRINT ON start printing
PRINT OFF cease printin
If the Print DCB cannot be opened the response is
"PRINTER UNAVAILABLE"; else the response is "OK".
If the print data set becomes full or the DCB abends, message
EXH814E may be written to the terminal. Print support ceases;
under some systems this is followed by an EXHIBIT abend.
In order to make non-3270 terminal I/O faster, code has been
added to suppress printing of any output which is identical to
the last written page (except prompt); only the new prompt
message is printed. Non-3270 terminals are simulated by 24*80
CRTs if the LINESIZE is 80 or more; 12*80 if the terminal is
12*80; and as 12*40 CRTs otherwise. Output to CRT type
terminals other than the 3270 (or compatible devices) may cause
loss of data unless the terminal has paging capability or
software changes are made.
Some EXHIBIT functions are not supported under TSO . Among
these are BUMP, 500, 21, STA, and others doing multiple writes
to the screen with a conditional test for input.
