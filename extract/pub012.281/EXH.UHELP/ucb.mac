UCB <devtyp × X=ucbadd × cuu × volser>

The UCB function formats Unit Control Blocks. If no options
are chosen, then the first UCB in the system is shown,
subsequent ENTER requests will retrieve the next sequential
ones. The display can be made selective by using one of the
options :

X=ucbadd display the UCB at the specified location in
storage. An ENTER will return the next sequential
UCB.
"devtyp" display the UCB with a corresponding device
type. An ENTER will retrieve the next UCB with that
type. Supported device types are :
1403,2540,2400,2311,2314,2260,3400,3330,3211,BSC1,etc.
"cuu" retrieve the UCB with that channel/unit
address (e.g. 00C, 182, etc.). An ENTER will refresh
the display.
"volser" retrieve the UCB with the specified volume
mounted. An ENTER will refresh the display.

The displayed fields are accompanied by mnemonics which are
shortened versions of the ones listed in the System Control
Blocks Manual.
