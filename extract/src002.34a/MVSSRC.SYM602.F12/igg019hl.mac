*FUNCTION/OPERATION- THIS MODULE CONTAINS THE SKELETONS OF THE CHANNEL*
*   PROGRAMS USED BY SCAN MODE. IT IS LOADED BY OPEN. THE DESIRED     *
*   CHANNEL PROGRAMS ARE MOVED TO THE WORKAREA AND COMPLETED THERE.   *
*   THERE IS A VECTOR TABLE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MODULE WHICH      *
*   ENABLES OPEN TO LOCATE ANY CHANNEL PROGRAM.                       *
*                                                                     *
*   CP22, BELOW IN FORM A, IS USED FOR READING AND WRITING BACK BOTH  *
*   PRIME DATA AND OVERFLOW RECORDS.  FORM A IS USED WHEN KEY AND DATA*
*   OF UNBLOCKED RECORDS IS SPECIFIED IN THE SETL INITIATING THE SCAN.*
*   FORM B IS USED FOR BLOCKED RECORDS OR UNBLOCKED DATA ONLY.  THE   *
*   READ COMMANDS ARE CHANGED TO THE CORRESPONDING WRITE COMMANDS IF  *
*   THE BUFFER IS PUTXED.                                             *
*                                                                     *
*   CP24 IS USED FOR READING THE COUNT AND DATA FIELDS OF THE TRACK   *
*   INDICES INTO THE WORK AREA.                                       *
*                                                                     *
*   CP23 IS USED BY THE SETL K MACRO TO LOCATE THE RECORD SPECIFIED   *
*   IN THE MACRO BY SEARCHING THE HIGH LEVEL INDICES, IF ANY, THE     *
*   TRACK INDEX AND THE DATA TRACK.  THE TRACK INDEX ENTRIES ARE READ *
*   INTO THE 'W' AREA OF THE WORK AREA.                               *
*                                                                     *
*   CP26 IS USED BY THE SETL K MACRO IF THE DESIRED RECORD IS AN      *
*   OVERFLOW RECORD AND THE OVERFLOW CHAIN MUST BE SEARCHED.          *
*                                                                     *
*   CP25 IS USED BY THE SETL I MACRO TO OBTAIN THE KEY AND TRACK      *
*   INDEX ENTRIES PERTAINING TO THE REQUESTED RECORD.                 *
*                                                                     *
