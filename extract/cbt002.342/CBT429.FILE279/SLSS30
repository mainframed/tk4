:h1.Introduction
.sp 3
:p.The System Library Subscription Service (SLSS)
is an interactive dialog application that you can use to
aid in creating and maintaining a library.  SLSS may be used
to support an individual library or several libraries which can
be accessed by a single or several users.
:h3.Major Functions
.sp
SLSS is an ISPF dialog that you use at a display terminal.
The functions available to you include:
.sp 2
:ul.
:li.BROWSE existing libraries.
:li.EDIT existing libraries.
:li.CREATE new libraries.
:li.DELETE entire library or selected entries within a library.
:li.PRINT listing of library.
:li.SORT library either in manual ID, location or title sequence.
:li.AUTHORIZE users to browse and/or edit library.
:li.UTILITY to maintain library owner and location.
:li.RESET library if abnormal termination of the dialog session
occurs.
:li.KEYWORD SCANNING of libraries.
:li.SCROLLING of data within library within the edit or browse
function.
:li.SPLIT SCREEN capability that allows you to partition the
display screen.
:li.DEBUG capability that allows you to trace the session while in
use.
:eul
:h3.SLSS Hierarchy
.sp
Internal to SLSS is a hierarchy that controls authority
and access to libraries.  There are four levels of access
within SLSS.
The highest level is assigned to a single user known as the
Library Administrator.  Assigning the administrator is done at
initialization time of SLSS (refer to Intialization for further
information).  The second level within SLSS is the Library
Owner.  The owner is assigned at the time the library is created
and can be modified or re-assigned by the owner of the library.
The third level is the authority to edit an individual library.
This authority is assigned or modified by the owner of the library.
The fourth level is the
browse authority, and is also assigned or modified by the owner of
the library.

:h1.Interacting with SLSS
.sp 2
This chapter tells you how to begin and end your SLSS session, and
how to use the display screen and terminal keys.
:h3.Panel Displays
.sp
SLSS communicates with you through a series of panels.  A PANEL
is a predefined display image that is presented on a display
terminal.  Panels may require a response, and that response is
used to determine the next panel to be displayed on the function
to be performed.  Your responses may be in uppercase or lowercase.
.*
.*===header break================================================
.*
:h3.Types of Panels
.sp
In using SLSS, you will see the following basic types of panels:
.sp
:ul
:li.Selection Panel - You select from a list of options by typing
its number or letter on the command/option line and pressing
the ENTER key.  Selection panels are also called menus.
.sp
:li.Entry Panel - You supply information by filling in labeled
fields.  In many cases fields are pre-entered based on what
you last entered.
.sp
:li.Manual/Library List - Displays a list of manuals available
within a pre-selected library or a list of available libraries that
can be selected.  These panels are scrollable by using the
pre-defined PF keys or entering the scroll commands.
.sp
:li.Scrollable Data Display - Displays output listing from the
report utility.
:eul
.*
.sp
:h3.Panel Field Definitions
.sp
The following is an alphabetic list of fields displayed
on Library Selection, Manual Selection, Browse and Edit panels.
:ul
:li :hp2.Creation Date:ehp2. - is the date the library was created.
:li :hp2.Date Ordered:ehp2. - is the date the manual was ordered.
:li :hp2.Date Received:ehp2. - is the date the manual was received
after being ordered.
:li :hp2.Last Mod. Date:ehp2. - is the date the library was modified.
:li :hp2.Library Name:ehp2. - is a user defined four character
name to the library.
:li :hp2.Library Number:ehp2. - is a user defined field.  This is
normally the library number supplied by IBM.
:li :hp2.Library Owner:ehp2. - is the user that owns the library.
This user is allowed to establish and remove authority to edit and/or
browse the library.
:li :hp2.Location:ehp2 - supplies the location of the manual
within the library.  This field is user defined and an understanding
of the filing system used within the library may be required to
aid in use of this field.
:li :hp2.Manual ID:ehp2. - is the identification key
of a manual.  This field is a :hp2.unique:ehp2. key within
the library.
:li :hp2.O:ehp2 - indicates if the manual is on order.
If the manual is on order the field will contain an '*' else blank.
:li :hp2.Sort Seq.:ehp2. - is the sequence the library is sorted.
If the library has not been sorted this field will be blank.
The sequence is either 1 - 4, L or T.  One through four indicate
the library was sorted using position one, two, three or four of the
Manual ID, 'L' indicates the location was used and 'T' indicates the
first title line was used.
:li :hp2.Title:ehp2 - this is the first or three title lines of
the manual.
:li :hp2.U:ehp2 - indicates if updates have been applied to the manual.
If updates have been applied the field will contain a 'Y' else blank.
:li :hp2.Ver:ehp2. - version of the manual.  This field may be blank.
:eul
.sp 2
:hp2.CAUTION:ehp2. :
Use of an :hp2.Ampersand '&' :ehp2.is not supported within SLSS.
If the character is entered into any of the fields unpredictable
results may occur.  :hp2.Do Not:ehp2. use the ampersand character
within SLSS.

.*===header break================================================
:h3 SLSS Invocation
.sp 1
To invoke SLSS, enter the command "SLSS".
When SLSS is invoked a copy of the library control file is
copied into the user's session.  This copy is edited to allow
only authorized library to be displayed on the 'Library Selection
Panel'.  If the user is not authorized to view any existing
libraries they will be prompted to either create a new library
on terminate the SLSS session.
.sp 1
If the user has been given authorized access to a library within
SLSS the first panel to be
displayed is the primary menu (Figure 5).  You may select an
option by typing its number or letter in the option field and
pressing the ENTER key; for example:
.sp 1
.fo off
  OPTION ===> 2
.fo on
.sp 1
to select the edit option.

:h2.KEYWORD (OPTION 3.2)

The owner of the library and the SLSS administrator are the only
users allowed to select this option.
This option will build a keyword scan file to be used by primary
option 'S' (SCAN).  The user is warned when invoking this option
that it could require several minutes to complete.  The reason for
this is that the manual title is parsed and each word is placed
in the keyword file along with the manual number.  The value of
a space is used as the delimiter when the title is parsed.  All
three lines of the title are parsed.

This option is used to modify information about a library.
The library name, owner, owner name, and location can be modified.
If the owner ID is modified that person and the administrator
are the only people allowed to select this option.  This means
that if a library owner selects this option and assigns a new
owner through this option that once this update is completed the
person that invoked this option is no longer the owner and cannot
perform the options allowed to the owner.  Caution should be used

:h1.SCAN (OPTION S)
.sp 3
The scan option allows a user to scan a pre-built keyword file
(utility option 3.2) and scan for a unique or partial word.
This option is intended to aid the user in locating manuals
for a subject or topic without knowing the manual ID's.
The user supplies the keyword to be scanned for.  If a partial
keyword is to be entered an asterisk '*' should be the last
character in the word.  The file is searched using the
keyword and the user notified of any matches found and the
manual ID's.  The user then has an option of viewing the titles
of all manuals found or continuing.  If a partial keyword was
entered the search continues and the process repeated if any
further matches are found.

The following figures supply the panels used in the scan option.

:h1.LIBRARIES, INSTALLATION and INITIALIZATION
.sp 3
The libraries contained on the install tape are as follows:
.sp
.fo off
  FILE #   TAPE DSN  DISK DSN        CONTAINS
  ______   ________  ________        ________

    4      SLSS.F4   SLSS.ISPSLIB    UNLOAD OF SKELETON LIBRARY
 
.fo on
The first step in the install instructions is to load down file

.sp
.fo off
 
  //SLSSLOAD JOB SLSS,UNLOAD
  //STEP1    EXEC PGM=IEBCOPY
  //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
  //SYSUT3   DD UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(1024,(100,50))

.sp
The input tape volume serial number, output data set name and
output disk should be modified before submitting.  After the
data set is loaded to disk the member PRINTDOC can be used to
print the remaining installation instructions and users guide.
.sp
.sp
The following libraries (partitioned data set) are required
for operation of SLSS in the MVS/TSO environment.
.sp
.fo off

.sp
The unloaded files for ISPCLIB, ISPPLIB, and ISPSLIB must
be allocated to the TSO user before you can invoke SLSS.
The output table library 'ISPTABL' does not have to be
pre-allocated, the initialization CLIST will free and re-allocate
the 'ISPTABL' DDname with the data set name supplied.
.sp
Once the files have been unloaded and allocated
the user should execute CLIST 'SLSSINIT'
to initialize the SLSS system.  The following panels will be
displayed and the user must supply the required information to
begin using the system.  Contained on tape file 1 is an SLSS
library that can be copied and replace the sample library 'SAMP'
created at initialization time.

During initialization the output table data set name is supplied
and stored in a control entry within a member of the output table.
.sp
The space for the table libraries will depend upon the
number of manuals and the number of libraries contained within the
SLSS system.
.sp
After executing CLIST 'SLSSINIT' the control file and the
library administrator entries will be saved in the output table.
You can now copy the sample library unloaded from tape file 1 or
invoke SLSS at this point.  Select option 2 and enter required
information.  The user must be authorized to edit the library
before option 2 will be invoked.
