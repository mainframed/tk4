Overview
________

Uploading Programs To MVS Using FTTSO or IND$FILE
_________________________________________________

    1) On  the MVS  system: Allocate  a JCL library using ISPF 3.2 or
       IEFBR14.       The   library   should   have   the   following
       characteristics:
                    BLKSIZE=3120, LRECL=80, RECFM=FB,
                    DSORG=PO, SPACE=(TRK,(15,1,10))

    2) On  the PC:  Execute the file SENDJCL.BAT to transfer assembly
       and link-edit  JCL to  the library  allocated in  the previous
       step.   SENDJCL.BAT, as  well as  the other .BAT files on this
       diskette,  contains   IND$FILE  control  statements  for  file
       transfer.   If you are using FTTSO or some other file transfer
       utility, edit  these files  so that  they contain  the correct
       control statements.
       Specify the host library as the operand of SENDJCL.BAT:
                    SENDJCL host.jcl.library

    3) On  the MVS  system:   Edit the JOB in member ALLOC in the JCL
       library.   This JOB, which allocates a macro library, assembly
       source library, object library and load library, contains edit
       instructions.  Submit the JOB and check the return codes.

    4) On the PC:  Execute the file SENDMAC.BAT to transfer macros to
       the macro library allocated in the previous step.  Specify the
       macro library as the operand of SENDMAC.BAT:
                    SENDMAC host.macro.library

    5) On  the PC:  Execute the file SENDASM.BAT to transfer assembly
       source files  to the  source library  allocated in step 4.  If
       you do  not want  to transfer all the source files to the host
       system (the  transfer may  take some  time), add 'REM ' before
       each SEND statement that is to be ignored.  Specify the source
       library as the operand of SENDASM.BAT:
                    SENDASM host.source.library

Uploading Programs To MVS Using XCOM 6.2
________________________________________

    1) On  the MVS  system: Allocate  a JCL library using ISPF 3.2 or
       IEFBR14.       The   library   should   have   the   following
       characteristics:
                    BLKSIZE=3120, LRECL=80, RECFM=FB,
                    DSORG=PO, SPACE=(TRK,(15,1,10))

    2) On MVS: Execute XCOM6.2 with the following SYSIN01 file:
                    TYPE=RECEIVE
                    LU=xcom-on-pc
                    FILETYPE=FILE
                    FILEOPT=REPLACE
                    LFILE=host-jcl-library(SYSIN01B)
                    FILE=A:\SYSIN01B.XCM
                    NEWXFER
                    LFILE=host-jcl-library(SYSIN01C)
                    FILE=A:\SYSIN01C.XCM

    3) On  MVS: edit  the member  SYSIN01B which was transferred from
       the PC:

       . Change LU= to PC XCOM's LU.
       . Change all strings "@JCL@" to the host JCL library name.

       Execute XCOM6.2 on MVS using this SYSIN01 file to.

    4) On  the MVS  system:   Edit the JOB in member ALLOC in the JCL
       library.   This JOB, which allocates a macro library, assembly
       source library, object library and load library, contains edit
       instructions.  Submit the JOB and check the return codes.

    5) On MVS: edit the member SYSIN01C transferred from the PC:

       . Change LU= to PC XCOM's LU
       . Change  all strings  "@SOURCE@" to the host assembler source
         library name.
       . Change  all strings  "@MACLIB@" to  the host  macro  library
         name.

       Execute XCOM6.2 on MVS using this SYSIN01 file.

Assembling, Linking and Executing Programs
__________________________________________

    1) On  the MVS  system: Edit  the JOB in member ASMLKD in the JCL
       library.   This JOB,  which contains  steps  to  assemble  and
       linkedut the  programs in  the source  library, contains  edit
       instructions.

    2) The member EXEC in the JCL library contains JCL to execute the
       sample program as a batch job.
