  FUNCTION:           The GETMY command is for use within CLISTs to
                      obtain  information   which  is   useful  for
                      building  JOB  cards and  SETUP  cards.   The
                      fields which can be requested are the account
                      number, the system number  and the programmer
                      name field of the user.

       Command        Operands

  -----------------------------------------------------------------

  Operands:  At least one of the following are required:

    PROG     - Returns programmer name field to CLIST variable &PROG.
    SYS      - Returns system number to CLIST variable &SYS.
    ACCT     - Returns account number to CLIST variable &ACCT.
    TERMID   - Returns your 4 byte terminal id

  Example:
    Assume you have logged on to TSO with the following command:
       LOGON XXSN111/PASSWORD ACCT(2222$33-S) PROG(MYNAM 4444 T)
    You then execute a CLIST containing the following command:
       GETMY PROG SYS ACCT

    After the CLIST uses that command it can access these variables:
       &PROG which contains "MYNAM 4444 T       " (full 20 char field);
       &SYS  which contains "SN" (two char field);
       &ACCT which contains "2222,33-S" (nine char field).
