  CLIST:              CLIB
  AUTHOR:             Jeff Sprehn
  AGENCY:             WDPSC
  FUNCTION:           Allocate  a  private CLIST  library  for  the
                      duration of your session.

  TERMINAL TYPE:      3270 type or dialup

  The CLIB  CLIST is used to  allocate a private CLIST  library for
  the duration of your session or  until you free it.  This library
  then  becomes an  implicit command-library  like  the user  CLIST
  library  (USER.CLIST).    Members  of  this  CLIST   library  can
  thereafter  be executed  simply  by  entering their  name.   This
  library should  have the same  DCB characteristics  as USER.CLIST
  since  they are  concatenated.   Every time  that  this CLIST  is
  invoked, the library to be allocated is  placed at the top of the
  stack and all  other CLIST libraries that might  be allocated are
  shoved down to make room for this library.  (In prior versions of
  this  CLIST,  subsequent  CLIB's would  wipe  out  prior  CLIBS).
  Unless you  LOGOFF, FREE  DDNAME SYSPROC,  or do  an UNCLIB,  all
  CLIST  libraries used  in  CLIB command  are  "attached" to  your
  session and their members may be invoked implicitly.

  Operands -

    Required - clist-library

    Default  - None.
      clist -library:  The name of the CLIST library to be allocated.
      clist-library#2:  An additional CLIST library to be allocated.
                        To avoid dataset name prefixing, this data
                        set name must be enclosed in triple quotes.

      print notif          Enter YES, NO, or do not specify.
                           'YES' will  cause the  following message
                           to be  displayed on your  terminal after
                           successful completion:

                                SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION
                                     (RETURN CODE = 0)

                           'NO' will prevent the above message from
                           being written to your  terminal.  If you
                           do not  specify the PRINT  keyword, then
                           'YES' is the default.

  EXAMPLE:
       If you were  not a PROD1 user,  and you first logged  on and
       entered:
                 CLIB 'AGNCY999.MISC.CLIST' XLIB('''XX00999.MISC.CLIST''

  Then the  following CLIST  libraries would  be allocated  to your
  session in the following order:

       l.   AGNCY999.MISC.CLIST
       2.   XX00999.MISC.CLIST
       3.   WDPSC.MASTER.CLIST
       4.   USER.CLIST
