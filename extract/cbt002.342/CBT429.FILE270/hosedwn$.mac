  CLIST:              HOSEDOWN
  AUTHOR:             Jeff Sprehn
  AGENCY:             WDPSC
  FUNCTION:           De-allocate user SPF Dialog Manager libraries
                      (undo what a previous FIREUP did).

  TERMINAL TYPE:      3270-type only

  The intended purpose of  this CLIST is to cancel the  effect of a
  previous execution of FIREUP.

  This CLIST will  de-allocate for you ANY OR ALL  of the following
  SPF Dialog Manager libraries:
       Panel library
       Message library
       Skeleton library
       Table input library
       Table output library
       File tailoring output library
       SPF link library

  The format of this command is as follows:

  HOSEDOWN  PANEL (dataset name of panel library) -
            MESSAGE(dataset name of message library) -
            SKELETON(dataset name of skeleton library) -
            TABLEIN(dataset name of table input library) -
            TABLEOUT(dataset name of table output library) -
            TAILOUT(dataset name of file tailoring output) -
            SPFLOAD(dataset name of SPF link library) -
            PRINT(de-alloc notification)

       'De-alloc notification' enter 'YES' if you wish the CLIST to
       write  out  one   line  message  for  each   library  to  be
       de-allocated stating  that the deallocation  was succcessful
       or enter 'NO' if you DO NOT wish this to take place.

  EXAMPLE #1
  __________

       De-allocate a  panel library called  "AGNCY999.PANEL.LIB", a
       message  library called  "AGNCY999.MESSAGE.LIB",  and a  SPF
       link library  called "AGNCY999.SPF.LOADLIB"  (User's PROFILE
       PREFIX  is  XX00999  and user  DOES  NOT  want  deallocation
       notification messages).

       HOSEDOWN  PANEL('''AGNCY999.PANEL.LIB''') -
                 MESSAGE('''AGNCY999.MESSAGE.LIB''') -
                 SPFLOAD('''AGNCY999.SPF.LOADLIB''') -
                 PRINT(NO)

  EXAMPLE #2
  __________

       De-allocate a panel library  called "XX00999.SPF.PANELIB", a
       message library called "XX00999.SPF.MSGLIB",  and a skeleton
       library called "XX00999.SKELETON.LIB" (User's PROFILE PREFIX
       is  XX00999 and  user  DOES  want deallocation  notification
       messages).

       HOSEDOWN  PANEL(SPF.PANELIB) -
                 MESSAGE(SPF.MSGLIB) -
                 SKELETON(SKELETON.LIB) -
                 PRINT(YES)

                                                         03/16/83


  This CLIST must be placed in one of the following:
       .    Inside a CLIST executing in  "straight TSO" (outside of
            SPF).

       .    Inside      a     LOGON      PROCEDURE     such      as
            PREFIX.MISC.CLIST(LOGON) for PROD1 users.

  The Dialog  Manager libraries  cannot be  deallocated within  SPF
  (Option  '6')  because  the   SPF  Program  Development  Facility
  libraries are OPEN and are not CLOSED until you exit SPF.
