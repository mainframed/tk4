  PROGRAM:       DDNTODSN
  AUTHOR:        Jeff Sprehn
  AGENCY:        WDPSC
  LANGUAGE:      Assembler
  LOCATION:      WDPSC.SHARED.LOAD
  FUNCTION:      Obtain DSNAME and VOLSER(s)  of data set allocated
                 to a given DDNAME.

  RUN MODE:      Batch or Interactive

  This program is a  subroutine meant to be called by  a high level
  language program such as COBOL which  will accept a DDNAME passed
  to it and pass  back the DSNAME allocated to that  DDNAME and the
  volume serial number(s) where the data set resides.

  To call this program, do the following:

       Move your 8 byte DDNAME to DDNAME of DDNTODSN-I-O-AREA.

       CALL 'DDNTODSN' using DDNTODSN-I-O-AREA.

            Where:
                 01  DDNTODSN-I-O-AREA.
                    05  FILLER  VALUE 'VS' PIC X(2).
                    05  DDNAME             PIC X(8).
                    05  DSNAME             PIC X(44).
                    05  VOL-COUNT          PIC S9(5) COMP.
                    05  VOL-TABLE
                        OCCURS 5 TIMES     PIC X(6).
                    05  SUCCESS-INDICATOR  PIC 99.

       Success-Indicator   Meaning
          00              DSNAME was successfully generated
          04              DDNAME was not allocated
                             (i.e., DSNAME could not be generated)




1                                                        DDNTODSN.2

  After the call, interrogate SUCCESS-INDICATOR.

  If SUCCESS-INDICATOR = 0/, then  DSNAME, VOL-COUNT, and VOL-TABLE
                         /0
  contain the following:

       DSNAME         DSNAME of the data set allocated to the given
                      DDNAME.

       VOL-COUNT      A number representing the significant entries
                      in VOL-TABLE.

       VOL-TABLE      Table  of volume  serial  numbers where  your
                      data set resides.
