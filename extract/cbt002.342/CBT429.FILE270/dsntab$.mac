  PROGRAM:       DSNTAB
  AUTHOR:        Kermit Kiser
  AGENCY:        WDPSC
  LANGUAGE:      Assembler
  LOCATION:      KK00150.MY.LOAD
  FUNCTION:      Subroutine to pass back list of all DSNAMEs
                 concatenated to a given DDNAME.

  This is a subroutine which accepts a DDNAME and passes back to the
  invoker a list of DSNAMEs concatenated to that DDNAME.  This program
  can return up to 50 datasets concatenated to a given DDNAME.

  To use this program from COBOL, do the following:

     .  Place the following data areas in WORKING STORAGE:

           01  THE-DDNAME                        PIC X(8).
           01  DSNAME-TABLE.
               05  DSNAME-ELEMENT OCCURS 50 TIMES.
                   10  FILLER                    PIC X(6).
                   10  THE-DSNAME                PIC X(44).
           01  TABLSIZE      VALUE +2500         PIC S9(4) COMP.
           01  NO-OF-SIGNIF-DSNAMES              PIC S9(4) COMP.

     .  Place the following code in the PROCEDURE DIVISION.

           MOVE your ddname TO THE-DDNAME.

           CALL 'DSNTAB' USING  THE-DDNAME
                                DSNAME-TABLE
                                TABLSIZE
                                NO-OF-SIGNIF-DSNAMES.

     .  After the CALL, the list of DSNAMES will be found in
        DSNAME-TABLE and the number of significant dataset
        names will be found in NO-OF-SIGNIF-DSNAMES.
