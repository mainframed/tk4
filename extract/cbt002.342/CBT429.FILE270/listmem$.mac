  PROGRAM:       LISTMEMS
  AUTHOR:        Jeff Sprehn
  AGENCY:        WDPSC
  LANGUAGE:      Assembler
  LOCATION:      WDPSC.SHARED.LOAD
  FUNCTION:      Given the name of a  partitioned data set, produce
                 an output file whose records  contain the names of
                 the members of that PDS (one record per member).

  RUN MODE:      Batch or Interactive

  This program is  used to produce an output  file (LRECL=80) which
  will contain  (in record positions 1-8)  the member names  of the
  partitioned data set which is allocated to the DDNAME INPDS.

  HOW TO USE THIS PROGRAM:

      IN BATCH:

            //    EXEC PGM=LISTMEMS
            //STEPLIB  DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=WDPSC.SHARED.LOAD
            //INPDS    DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=dataset name of your PDS
            //OUTMEMS  DD  UNIT=SYSDA,DISP=(NEW,PASS),
            //   DSN=&&MEMBERS,
            //   SPACE=(TRK,(2,1)),
            //   DCB=(RECFM=FB,LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=6160)

                                                         03/16/83


       UNDER TSO:

            ATTR AT1 RECFM(F,B) LRECL(80) BLKSIZE(6160)
            ALLOC F(INPDS) DA('dataset name of your PDS') SHR
            ALLOC F(OUTMEMS) DA('work dataset name') NEW -
                  UNIT(SYSDA) TRACKS SPACE(2,1) -
                  USING(AT1)
            CALL 'WDPSC.SHARED.LOAD(LISTMEMS)'

  NOTE:  LISTMEMS will output a valid dummy NULLFILE if your PDS
         contains no records.  Therefore, a subsequent step that
         reads the dataset would result in an immediate EOF.
