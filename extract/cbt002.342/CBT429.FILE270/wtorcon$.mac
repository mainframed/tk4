  FUNCTION:
    This program is intended for use by internal support staff at
    WDPSC.  Its purpose is to ask a question about the environment
    which the operations staff can answer with a Y or N.  Based on that
    answer a jobstep which performs certain functions can be executed
    or skipped.

  HOW TO USE:
  - Create a jobstep which executes WTORCOND.
  - Place the question (up to 38 characters) in its PARM field.
    The program will supply the phrase 'REPLY Y OR N' and place the
    supplied question in a WTOR after it.
  - The operator's reply is analyzed and a condition code is set:
      0 - reply was Y   8 - reply was N    15 - parm length more than 38
    If the reply is something other than Y or N the WTOR is reissued.
  - The condition code can then be tested in a succeeding jobstep.



  SAMPLE JCL:

 //*

 //*      "REPLY Y OR N.  SHOULD WEEKLY LOGREC BE SUBMITTED?"
 //*
 //WTOR  EXEC PGM=WTORCOND,PARM='SHOULD WEEKLY LOGREC BE SUBMITTED?'
 //STEPLIB DD DSN=WDPSC.PROGLIB,DISP=SHR
 //*
 //* TEST THE CONDITION CODE SET IN THE PREVIOUS STEP AND ACT ON IT.
 //*
 //TESTER EXEC FTL,COND=(0,NE,WTOR)
 //IN01 DD ...
 //OUT01 DD ......
