           PURPOSE:      The RMF DIRECT ACCESS DEVICE ACTIVITY REPORT
                         only reports on DASD within a single CPU.  This
                         makes it difficult to spot heavy usage of some
                         volumes that are being accessed by more than
                         one CPU in a shared DASD environment.  This
                         program causes the ERBRMFPP program to give a
                         summary of all shared DASD from all CPUs on
                         one ERBRMFPP report.

           FUNCTION:     Process SMF Type 74 records, change the CPU
                         ID on all records to a common name (COMB) and
                         multiply various fields by the number of CPUs
                         represented by the RMF Type 74 data.  The CPU
                         count is passed as a PARM to SMF74MOD.  Both
                         XA and Non XA SMF Type 74 are modified.  The
                         IBM ERBRMFPP program can handle both XA and
                         Non XA SMF Type 74 with the same CPU name to
                         produce a composite report.

           ADVANTAGE:    The combined report can allow the viewer to
                         see the effect of all CPUs on a single volume
                         without adding counts from several reports.
                         It allows the spotting of very busy devices
                         that may need attention; but might be missed
                         due to apparent moderate activity on seperate
                         DASD within CPU reports.

           NOTE:         The RMF on all CPUs must be collected using
                         the same cycle time and elapsed time.  If any
                         CPU needs IPLing during the collection time the
                         the results will be inaccurate in porportion to
                         the the CPU down time.
