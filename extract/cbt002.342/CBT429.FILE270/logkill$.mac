LOGKILLR actually consists of two CSECTs which are assembled together.

LOGKILLM, the entry point, is used to replace the call to IKJEFLE in
module IKJEFLA or IKJEFLA1(XA). This requires some tricky link-editing:

 INCLUDE USERLB(LOGKILLR)
 CHANGE IKJEFLE(LOGKILLM)
 INCLUDE LPALIB(IKJEFLA1)
 INCLUDE LPALIB(IKJEFLA1)     (to get IKJEFLE back in there)
 ALIAS LOGKILLR,and all the normal stuff...
 NAME IKJEFLA1(R)

LOGKILLM attaches LOGKILLR as a subtask before calling IKJEFLE which
attaches IKJEFLC who does the prompting stuff (terminal IO).

If IKJEFLE does not return in five minutes, LOGKILLR will abend the
address space. If IKJEFLE returns within five minutes, LOGKILLR is
detached before he can complete his mission.

This code may have to be updated to run in 31 bit mode. I don't think
we ran it under XA.
