  PROGRAM:       ALLOCMEM
  AUTHOR:        Jeff Sprehn
  AGENCY:        WDPSC
  LANGUAGE:      Assembler
  LOCATION:      WDPSC.SHARED.LOAD
  FUNCTION:      Dynamically allocate a partitioned dataset and its
                 member  to  a  given  DDNAME  from  a  high  level
                 language program.

  RUN MODE:      Batch or Interactive

  ALLOCMEM is  a subroutine  which can  be called  by a  high level
  language such as COBOL, PL1, or DYL260/DYL280.  Its purpose is to
  dynamically allocate a partitioned dataset  and its member to the
  supplied DDNAME.   In this way, if  the member name is  not known
  until execution time,  this subroutine could be called  to do the
  allocation when the  member name is known.   Also this subroutine
  will deallocate  (FREE) the DDNAME  (if needed) before  doing the
  allocation.  To call this subroutine from a COBOL program, do the
  following:

       o    Place the following data area in the WORKING STORAGE:

            01   ALLOCMEM-I-O-AREA.
                 05  DDNAME                    PIC X(8).
                 05  DSNAME                    PIC X(44).
                 05  MEMBER-NAME               PIC X(8).
                 05  SUCCESS-INDICATOR         PIC 9(2).

       o    Place the following code in the PROCEDUREDIVISION:

            MOVE your ddname
              TO DDNAME OF ALLOCMEM-I-O-AREA.
            MOVE your dsname of your partitioned dataset
              TO DSNAME OF ALLOCMEM-I-O-AREA.
            MOVE your member name
              TO MEMBER-NAME OF ALLOCMEM-I-O-AREA.

            CALL 'ALLOCMEM' USING ALLOCMEM-I-O-AREA.

       o    After     the   CALL    of     ALLOCMEM,    interrogate
            SUCCESS-INDICATOR             OF     ALLOCMEM-I-O-AREA.
            SUCCESS-INDICATOR  will contain  one  of the  following
            values after the call:

                      VALUE              MEANING
                      -----     -----------------------------
                        00      Allocation was successful
                        04      Invalid or missing ddname
                        08      Invalid or missing dsname
                        12      Invalid or missing member name
                        16      Dataset not catalogued
                        20      Unsuccessful free of ddname
                        24      Unsuccessful dynamic allocation
  NOTE:     Make  sure that  DDNAME,  DSNAME,  and MEMBER-NAME  are
            padded with spaces if less than maximum size.
