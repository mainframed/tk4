 FUNCTION


  IF THE PARM FIELD CONTAINS JUST A NUMBER, IT IS RETURNED AS COND CODE

  IF JUST CHARS, THE FIRST IS CONVERTED TO DECIMAL AND RETURNED.

  IF A NUMBER FOLLOWED BY CHARS IS PRESENT, THE NUMBER IS USED AS AN
     INDEX INTO THE CHAR STRING AND THAT CHAR IS RETURNED.
     (A BLANK OR COMMA IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE NUMBER IS IGNORED)

  IF PARM IS NULL OR CHAR REQUESTED IS NOT PRESENT, CODE IS ZERO

  LEADING BLANKS ARE IGNORED

  EXAMPLES:

   EXEC PGM=SETRC,PARM='99'    SETS COND CODE = 99

   EXEC PGM=SETRC,PARM='A'     SETS COND CODE = 193

   EXEC PGM=SETRC,PARM='AB'    SETS COND CODE = 193

   EXEC PGM=SETRC,PARM='2,AB'  SETS COND CODE = 194

   EXEC PGM=SETRC,PARM='3 ABC' SETS COND CODE = 195

   EXEC PGM=SETRC,PARM='3ABC'  SETS COND CODE = 195

   EXEC PGM=SETRC,PARM=''      SETS COND CODE = 0

   EXEC PGM=SETRC,PARM='3,AB'  SETS COND CODE = 0

   EXEC PGM=SETRC,PARM=' $'    SETS COND CODE = 91
