*    FTL MAY BE USED UNDER O/S FOR  TRANSFER OF MULTIPLE SEQUENTIAL
* FILES IN ONE STEP. THIS SAVES INITIATION/TERMINATION TIME.AND IS
*    FTL WILL RUN IN 4K (NOT INCLUDING FILE BUFFERS)
*
*    FTL CAN REBLOCK FILES OR CHANGE PHYSICAL RECORD LENGTH OR FORMAT
* BY SPECIFYING APPROPIATE DCB PARAMETERS ON THE OUTPUT DATA DEFINITION
* (DD) STATEMENT.
*
*    THE DD STATEMENTS ARE PAIRED USING NAMES IN AND OUT AS PREFIXES
* FOLLOWED BY A TWO-CHARACTER NUMBER FROM 01 TO 99. THESE PAIRS MUST BE
* SEQUENTIAL STARTING WITH IN01 AND OUT01 AND INCREASING WITHOUT BREAK
* FOR AS MANY FILES AS DESIRED.
*    ANY SEQUENTIALLY ORGANIZED FILE MAY BE INPUT OR OUTPUT. IT MAY
* HAVE ANY RECORD FORMAT, RECORD LENGTH, AND BLOCKSIZE CONSISTENT WITH
* O/S. EXCEPTIONS ARE INDEXED SEQUENTIAL(ISAM) DATA SET ORGANIZATION,
* VARIABLE SPANNED RECORD FORMAT, AND PARTITIONED DATA SETS. THE LATTER
* MAY BE PROCESSED AS INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS.
*
*    WHEN EXPANDING   THE RECORD LENGTH, THE ADDITIONAL FIELD WILL HAVE
* UNPREDICTABLE CONTENTS. OTHER CHANGES OF LENGTH, FORMAT, OR BLOCKSIZE
* DO NOT AFFECT FILE CONTENT.
*
*    FOR EACH TRANSFER PAIR, A MESSAGE IS WRITTEN TO AN OUTPUT DATA SET
* (DD NAME IS MESSAGES) GIVING A RECORD COUNT AND VOLUME SERIAL NUMBER
* OF INPUT AND OUTPUT DATA SETS IF ON DIRECT ACCESS OR TAPE.
*
* FTL IS AN OLD SCIENCE FICTION TERM MEANING "FASTER THAN LIGHT".

*    THIS EXAMPLE SHOWS A DCB GIVEN FOR EVERY DD STATEMENT, THIS IS
* NOT NECESSARY WHEN NO CHANGE OF RECORD LENGTH, RECORD FORMAT, OR
* BLOCKSIZE IS BEING MADE, BECAUSE THE PROGRAM WILL COPY THESE DCB
