  CLIST:              WATDSN
  AUTHOR:             Jeff Sprehn
  AGENCY:             WDPSC
  FUNCTION:           Given a  DDNAME, display, in  the appropriate
                      order, all of  the DSNAMES (if any)  that are
                      currently allocated to that DDNAME.

  TERMINAL TYPE: 3270 type or dialup

  Syntax -
  ___________________________________________________________________
      Command          Operands
  ___________________________________________________________________
      WATDSN           ddname
  ___________________________________________________________________

  Operands -
    Required -
      ddname:  DDNAME with which the datasets are allocated to.

  Example:

       To determine the  order of concatenation on  ddname SYSPROC,
       enter the following:

            WATDSN SYSPROC




1                                                        WATDSN.2
                                                         06/25/82


       The CLIST would return, for example, the following:

            DDNAME:  SYSPROC     DSNAME:  AGNCY999.MY.CLIST
                                          JC00999.MISC.CLIST
                                          WDPSC.MASTER.CLIST
                                          USER.CLIST

   NOTE:

       SYSPROC is the  DDNAME used by your session  which the CLIST
       libraries  (whose members  may  be  invoked implicitly)  are
       allocated to.
