* CBT Update                                ------------  Date 10/26/98
*
*       SUPRASM  - added new sample JCL to assemble SUPRNAME utility
*       SUPRJCL  - added new sample JCL to execute SUPRNAME utility
*       SUPRNAME - PARSEKMD should be PARSKMD pickup correct macro
*       KMDPARS  - fixed to pickup supplied register equates

*
* DIS Mods Tape - Version 8.0               ------------  Date 10/17/89
*
*       PANLEXIT - deleted as SPFEXEC is a more powerful replacement.
*
*       CONCAT   - (AKA CONCATEM) updated to V2.0 which is REENTRANT.
*
*       SETVAR   - updated to 2.2, now defaults to TSOE assemble. Refs
*                  to IKJCT433 are now WXTRN. Too many phone calls!
*
*       FILEINFO - updated to V2.0 which is REENTRANT.
*
*       HOTKEYS -  updated HOTKEYS to have options for using
*                  FILEAID and IOF as some installations may not have
*                  these critical packages!
*
*       STACK FAST - updated STACK command to version 2.0 which has the
*                  "FAST" operand. Placing this at the beginning of a
*                  CLIST may improve performance by 50% or more. It runs
*                  most CLISTs and eliminates the TMP ATTACH overhead
*                  for TSO commands. Not tested with 1.4 or 2.x TSOs.
*
*       VPSSSEPR - Deleted. VPS 5.0 has an 80 column separator routine.
*
*       EDITNEW  - Finally, after many requests, I think we have
*       EDITAPP    identified most of the pieces of the "better edit"
*                  interface which has been often requested by those
*                  who once worked at this installation. See the
*                  EDIT$ member for details on this "object-action"
*                  interface we developed years ago.
*
*
* DIS   Mods Tape - Version 7.3             ------------  Date 05/05/89
*
*       HOTKEYS  - updated clists to add FLIST option which allows
*                  placing cursor in a dataset name and requesting
*                  all datasets which match name to cursor postion.
*
*       ISPCDSN  - updated to allow extraction of entire screen
*                  image and determine precise cursor positioning.
*                  See HOTKEY update for example of capabilities.
*

*
*       ISPCDSN  - updated to fix a problem with extracting dataset
*                  names in ISPF message lines and to better handle
*                  DDNAMEs and dataset names in CLIST code. (HOTKEYS)
*
*       SMPEIOF  - updated to fix a problem with new SMPE users.
*
*       LOGKILLR - added by request of Donald Daley at The Aerospace
*                  Corporation. We used this to kill TSO LOGON
*                  address spaces if prompting did not complete
*                  within five minutes. We don't use it now.
*                  I don't know how this will work with XA. See LOGKILL$

*                  blksize and required space for allocation of
*                  disk files.
*
*          PFKEYCHG - added program that determines which
*                  PF Key has been pressed or determines
*                  which function (such as END, RETURN, UP,
*                  DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT, etc) has been requested.
*
*          PFKEYRST - added program that is used with
*                  Dialog Manager to "restore" the users PF Key
*                  definitions to their original values after
*                  the program PFKEYCHG modified them.
*
*       NEWISPF  - updated NEWISPF, SPFEXEC, and WDPSCXS to fix a
*                  problem due to a TSOE change in the stack format.
*                  NEWISPF and SPFEXEC do not need to be linked with
*                  ISRPCP (PDF) anymore - they will LOAD and CALL it.
*
*       SCXSCAN$ - added the usermod I use to install the "X" command
*                  exit facility under TSOE (links into IKJTSLAR).

*                  a batch job. Reads same data as ADMUSP6 and calls
*                  PGF ICU to create charts.
*
*       INDEX    - updated to allow right-to-left searching.
*                  Note: TSOE R3 &SYSINDEX does substring searching
*                   if you need that capability.
*
*       TRANS    - new TSO command which translates characters in CLIST
*                  variables like REXX TRANSLATE command. We will try
*                  to make this into a builtin function if we ever get
*                  TSOE release 4...
*
*       WHATDDN  - new TSO command which returns the DDNAME associated
*                  with a given dataset name. Written to allow HOTKEYS
*                  to support VIO and uncataloged datasets.
*
*       HOTKEYS  - added support for FILEAID and IOF APPLIDS and
*                  support for VIO datasets via the WHATDDN command!

*                  Note: Although I have not yet installed ISPF 2.3,
*                   I have read the install manual and those 'slick'
*                   new user exits do not allow any ISPF functions!
*                   SPFEXEC is much more powerful as a panel exit.
*
*       SHOW     - updated for JES 2.1.5 level (& SHOWFJM).

* WDPSC Mods Tape - Version 3               ------------  Date 6/28/84
*                               First version sent to CBT
*
*     The purpose of this tape is to transfer some of WDPSC's local
*   utilities. All this stuff works here, but we don't guarantee it
*   to work anywhere else. Some programs may need modification for
*   an installation. Some are good only as "HOWTO" samples.
*
*     This tape contains the WDPSC programs which were released in
*   CBT files 270-274. Two of those programs, named FTL and KOMM, have
*   been modified and the latest versions are on this tape.
