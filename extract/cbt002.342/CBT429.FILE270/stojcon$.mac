  PROGRAM:       STOJCONV
  AUTHOR:        Jeff Sprehn
  AGENCY:        WDPSC
  LANGUAGE:      COBOL
  LOCATION:      WDPSC.SHARED.LOAD
  FUNCTION:      Convert  standard dates  of the  form (MMDDYY)  to
                 Julian and serial after date validation.

  RUN MODE:      N/A...this is a subroutine.

  This is  a subroutine which accepts  a standard date of  the form
  (MMDDYY) and converts it to two  (2) other types of dates, Julian
  and serial  if and  only if the  input date is  a valid  date.  A
  Julian date is of the form YYDDD where  YY is the year and DDD is
  a  three digit  number  representing  the displacement  from  the
  beginning  of that  year.  A  serial date  is of  the form  NNNNN
  representing the displacement from the beginning of the twentieth
  century.   For example  January  1, 1900  is  serial date  00001,
  January 2, 1900  is serial date 00002, January 1,  1901 is serial
  date 00366 (since 1900 was not a leap year), and so on.

  Serial date is a very useful tool  when one wishes to compute the
  days elapsed between two dates in time when the years may differ.
  Julian date will not serve this purpose well.  For example; using
  Julian dates there would be 636 elapsed days between December 31,
  l979 and  January 1,  1980 (80001 -  79365 =  636) where  in fact
  there is  only 1.   Using serial dates  rather than  Julian would
  yield the correct answer of 1.

                                                         06/25/82


  This program  is also  an interface to  the CONVDATE  entry point
  STOJDATE.  STOJDATE will  abend if you supply it  with an invalid
  date  such as  063279 (there  are only  30 days  in June).   This
  subroutine (STOJCONV) will completely edit your date first before
  calling STOJDATE to  obtain your Julian date.  A switch  is to be
  interrogated to determine the success of that edit.

  HOW TO USE THIS PROGRAM:

  Place the following 0l level into your WORKING STORAGE SECTION:

       01   STOJCONV-I-O-AREA.
            05   FILLER              PIC X(8).
            05   IN-STANDARD-DATE    PIC X(6).
            05   OUT-JULIAN-DATE     PIC 9(5).
            05   OUT-SERIAL-DATE     PIC 9(5).
            05   UNSUCCESSFUL-EDIT   PIC X(3).

  Do the following in your PROCEDURE DIVISION:

       MOVE your date to be converted TO IN-STANDARD-DATE OF
            STOJCONV-I-O-AREA.
       CALL 'STOJCONV' USING STOJCONV-I-O-AREA.
       IF UNSUCCESSFUL-EDIT = 'YES'
            do your error routine

       ELSE
            your date is now in Julian and serial date format in
       OUT-JULIAN-DATE and OUT-SERIAL-DATE respectively.
