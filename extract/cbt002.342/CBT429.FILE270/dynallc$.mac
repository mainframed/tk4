  PROGRAM:       DYNALLOC
  AUTHOR:        Jeff Sprehn
  AGENCY:        WDPSC
  LANGUAGE:      Assembler
  LOCATION:      WDPSC.SHARED.LOAD
  FUNCTION:      Subroutine to dynamically allocate a given dataset
                 to a given DDNAME.


  RUN MODE: Batch or interactive


  This  program is  a subroutine  which  dynamically allocates  the
  following types of datasets to the DDNAME given:

       .    Sequential dataset
       .    A partitioned dataset with or without member name
       .    A GDG  expressed with  absolute or  relative generation
            number
       .    A VSAM file

  To call this program from COBOL, do the following:


  1.   Place the following area in WORKING STORAGE:


            01  DYNALLOC-I-O-AREA.
                05  DDNAME                    PIC X(8).
                05  DSNAME                    PIC X(44).

  2.   Place the following in the PROCEDURE DIVISION:


            MOVE your ddname
              TO DDNAME OF DYNALLOC-I-O-AREA.
            MOVE your dataset name
              TO DSNAME OF DYNALLOC-I-O-AREA.

            CALL 'DYNALLOC' USING DYNALLOC-I-O-AREA.


  3.   After the call, examine RETURN-CODE


       RETURN CODE Value      Meaning
       _________________     ________


             0                Dynamic allocation was successful

             4                Unable to free the DDNAME

             8                Unsuccessful dynamic allocation

            12                Dataset not catalogued

            16                Invalid DSNAME given

  Example
  _______


  Within a COBOL  program, dynamically allocate a  VSAM file called
  VSAMA.AGY999.TABLE.INDEX.BASE to DDNAME=TABLINDX


       MOVE 'TABLINDX' TO DDNAME OF DYNALLOC-I-O-AREA.
       MOVE 'VSAMA.AGY999.TABLE.INDEX.BASE'
         TO DSNAME OF DYNALLOC-I-O-AREA.

       CALL 'DYNALLOC' USING DYNALLOC-I-O-AREA.

       IF RETURN-CODE = 0
         NEXT SENTENCE
       ELSE
         Do error routine  (See Table of return codes)
