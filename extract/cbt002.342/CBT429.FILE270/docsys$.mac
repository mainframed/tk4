 DOCSYS

  DOCSYS is an ISPF dialog used for maintaining online documentation and
  retrieving it interactively.  A document system consists of DOCSYS, an
  index library and one or more document libraries.  Multiple document
  systems can be established and even linked together if desired.  A
  document system is started from ISPF by a clist (See DOCSYS, DOCTECH,
  DOCSAMP, DOCIOCTL for examples.) which defines the primary high and
  middle dataset qualifiers used for document libraries and also
  specifies display headings and authorization for updating.
  Indexes to the documents are used to generate and display an ISPF
  table from which the user may select documents for display or printing

  Notes:
     1) References to CLOG may be removed. CLOG is a copy of the IBM
        send command zapped to use an alternate dataset for logging.

     2) The ROTATE90 program is not enclosed. It is an IBM FDP. If not
        available, substitute another print option on the DOCPM.. panels
        There is a public domain 90 degree pgm called ROTATER in file
        316 of the CBT mods tape.

     3) The LISTPDS program is from file 316 of the CBT mods tape.
        The PDS command is from file 182 of the CBT mods tape.

     4) The authorization code must be altered to fit each startup
        clist to the document system.

     5) The INDEXES library must use INDEXES for the final qualifier
        as coded and it must have an LRECL of 200. Be sure to copy the
        sample index library to a dataset with that LRECL after loading.

     6) Here are the components as far as I have been able to identify
        them. Please let me know if you find anything missing. Note that
        the PARMCNVS program which builds a control card used by ROTATE9
        has no source but I have enclosed the load module.
