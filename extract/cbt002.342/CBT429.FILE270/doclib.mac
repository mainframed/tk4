  FUNCTION:      Utility table handling program used by DOCSYS systems.
                 This is the program that dynamically builds, scrolls,
                 and processes the DOCSYS indexes and detail screens.


  This is a general purpose Dialog Manager tabling services program.
  This program accepts an input file which contains the table data and
  then builds and displays a temporary virtual storage table.

  The program processes two (2) action codes which are as follows:

       S    Display documentation member
       P    Print documentation member

  Each record on the input file (which becomes an entry in the table)
  instructs this program which ISPF SELECT CMD to invoke for the above
  two action codes.


  Input file format
  .................

    Cols         Contents
    ---------    ------------------------------------

    001 - 002    'D1' for first description line
                 'D2' for 2nd description line if any
                 'D3' for 3rd description line if any
    003 - 003    FILLER
    004 - 073    Description of entry (could be 1 - n
                   columns of data represented here)
                   this field is protected output.
    074 - 074    FILLER
    075 - 079    First 5 bytes of command name to be
                   invoked if this entry is selected
                   (spaces if this is not a 'D1' rec)
    080 - 080    FILLER
    081 - 200    Parameters to pass to command if this field is
                   selected.  Three parameters must be supplied.
                   (spaces if this is not a 'D1' rec)

  For example;
      If a record on the input file has 'DOC01' in
      record positions 75-79:
        then
          the CLIST DOC01SEL will be invoked if the user
                             selected action code = 'S'
                    DOC01PRT will be invoked if the user
                             selected action code = 'P'

   The first three (3) records on the input file
   however must contain panel title and column heading
   information as follows:

      Columns       Contents
      -------       --------------------------------

      001-002       'T1'  for the panel title
                    'T2'  for panel column heading #1
                    'T3'  for panel column heading #2
      003-003       FILLER
      004-082       Title or column heading
      083-200       FILLER


   A PARM must be passed to this program as follows:

      ISPEXEC SELECT PGM(TBLHNDLR) PARM(n,tttttttt)

           where:

                 n = '1' for using panel TBLHDLR1
                           (single spaced entries)
                     '2' for using panel TBLHDLR2
                           (double spaced entries)
                     '3' for using panel TBLHDLR3
                           (triple spaced entries)

    How to add a memo to the Tech Services online document system (K.D).

 1. Copy the memo into the SOFTD150.DOCSYS.MEMO library.

 2. Edit the index for memos in SOFTD150.DOCSYS.INDEXES(TECHMEMO) and
   create a new index line (at line four) similiar to the current ones.
   The four items of non-display control information in column 75 are
   updated as follows:

   A. The first item is the DOCSYS component which handles a request for
     this item. Should not need to be changed.

   B. The DSNAME suffix added to SOFTD150.DOCSYS to make the library
     name which contains the document. Should not need to be changed.

   C. The member name of the memo. Use the name you copied your memo
     with.

   D. A parameter for sequential datasets and special print requirements
     Should remain as DUMMY1 normally.

 3. To be real nice, you should edit the primary index in
   SOFTD150.DOCSYS.INDEXES(TECHPRIM) and update the date for when the
   last memo was added.

  PROGRAM:       ALLOCGDG
  AUTHOR:        Jeff Sprehn
  AGENCY:        WDPSC
  LANGUAGE:      Assembler
  LOCATION:      WDPSC.SHARED.LOAD
  FUNCTION:      Dynamically  allocate  a   generation  data  group
                 member  expressed  with  the  relative  generation
                 number to the DDNAME and DSNAME provided.

  RUN MODE:      Interactive

  This program is intended  to be used in CLISTS to  allocate a GDG
  member expressed with the relative  generation number because the
  TSO ALLOC command will not let you  do so.  Hence; if you wish to
  allocate  a GDG  member expressed  with  the relative  generation
  number, issue a CALL to this program in the CLIST where you would
  normally place your  TSO ALLOC statement (if  the ALLOC statement
  were to allow you to do so).

  To call this program from a CLIST, do the following:

       CALL 'WDPSC.SHARED.LOAD(ALLOCGDG)' 'ddname,dsn×'

            where
                 ddname is the ddname you wish the data set
                        allocated to.

                 dsn is the DSNAME of the GDG expressed with
                     the relative generation number.

  EXAMPLE:

       CALL 'WDPSC.SHARED.LOAD(ALLOCGDG)' 'MASTERIN.AGY999.MY.GDG(+0)×'


       After the call, &LASTCC will contain either 0 or 4.

       If &LASTCC = 0, then the file was successfully allocated.
       If &LASTCC = 4, then the file was not successfully allocated
                       for the one of the following reasons:

                       a.  Invalid DDNAME passed to this program.
                       b.  Missing comma between DDNAME and DSN.
                       c.  Data set DSN not cataloged.
                       d.  Data set DSN not on on-line disk.
                       e.  Missing × after the DSN in parm.

                  1 - SHOW IMPORT CHART ; The member you specify is load
                    your import data library and, provided there are no
                    the Chart Utility is called to plot the data immedia

                  2 - PRINT IMPORT ONLY ; the member you specify is load
                    your import data library and, provided there are no
                    the Chart Utility is called to print the chart. The

                    the Chart Utility is called. The home panel is displ

                  4 - LOAD SAVED CHART ; The Chart Utility is called to
                    the member specified from the data save library. The
                    panel is displayed.

                  5 - SHOW SAVED CHART ; The Chart Utility is called to
                    the member specified from the data save library. The

         Import Data Formats:

           The import data library consists of members containing either
          data or paired data. The table data format is described below.
          paired data format is described on the following page.

              Table data consists of a number of records which give a ta
          data to be plotted.  The records are formatted as follows:

           Record 1.
              Contains the chart heading.  Leading and trailing blanks a
              removed from the text supplied in the record and the resul
              string is used to title the generated chart.  The heading
              be longer than 132 characters.

           Record 2.
              Contains the column headings of the table, which will form
              chart keys. The chart keys are the labels used in the grap
              legend to describe the dependent lines (variables).  These
              must be single words (without imbedded blanks) of not more
              132 characters.  Occurrences of underscore characters (_)
              word are replaced by blanks so that blank characters may b
              generated in the key text if required.

              One word must be provided for each data column to be plott
              (except the first, which is used as the X data).

           Records 3 - n
              Contain the table of data.    Each record contains one tab
              The first word is the 'X value' for the row, further words
              the dependent Y values.  There must be one Y value for eac
              specified on the key record (Record 2).  X values may be n
              or alphanumeric.  Y values must be numeric.

          Sample data might be:

             History of Results for XYZ Ltd. 1973-1980
                      Costs       Sales

             74        220         220
             75        280         300
             76        330         340
             77        430         520
             78        550         630
             79        620         640

         Import Data Formats (continued):

              Paired data consists of four types of records which descri
          or more groups of X-Y data pairs (paired data groups). In cont
          table data, where each X value must have a Y value for all dep
          variables being plotted, paired data groups have X-Y pairs (po
          where each X value needs only one Y value.

           Record 1.
              Contains the chart heading.  Leading and trailing blanks a
              removed from the text supplied in the record and the resul
              string is used to title the generated chart.  The heading
              be longer than 132 characters.

           Record 2.
              Contains the group labels for the chart.  The group labels
              chart keys) are the labels used in the graph legend to des
              the dependent lines (variables).  These keys must be singl
              (without imbedded blanks) of not more than 132 characters.
              Occurrences of underscore characters (_) in a word are rep
              by blanks so that blank characters may be generated in the
              text if required.

              This record can be left blank (not omitted) if the keys ar
              placed on the group delimiter records. (See Record 3 and e
              below.)

           Records 3 and where needed. (Group delimiter record.)
              This record begins with the three character string "=NG" w
              indicates the beginning of a new paired data group. It may

  FUNCTION:      Subroutine which  accepts a standard  date, julian
                 date,  or  serial  date and  returns  a  formatted
                 gregorian date.

  RUN MODE:      Batch or Interactive

  This is a  subroutine which accepts a standard date  (of the form
  MMDDYY), julian date (of the form  YYDDD), or serial date (of the
  form NNNNN) and returns an l8 byte formatted date as follows:

       18 Byte Field = MMMMMMMMM DD, 19YY
            where
                 MMMMMMMMM is 'January  '
                              'February '
                              'March    '
                               Etc.

                 DD        is day of month (zero suppressed)

                 YY        is year

  HOW TO USE THIS SUBROUTINE:

  1.   Place the following data area in WORKING STORAGE:

            01  CNV2GREG-I-O-AREA.
                 05  INPUT-FIELDS.
                      10  TYPE-OF-INPUT-DATE             PIC X(03).
                      10  INPUT-DATE                     PIC X(06).
                 05  OUTPUT-FIELDS.
                     10  VALID-INPUT-DATE                 PIC X(03).
                     10  FORMATTED-DATE                   PIC X(18).

  2    Do the following in your PROCEDURE DIVISION:

       a.   Load  TYPE-OF-INPUT-DATE with  'STA',  'JUL', or  'SER'
            depending  upon whether  the date  to  be converted  is
            standard, julian, or serial.

       b.   Move the date to be converted to INPUT-DATE (INPUT-DATE
            is 6 bytes  in length.  If the date to  be converted is
            julian or serial, left justify it in INPUT-DATE.)

       c.   CALL 'CNV2GREG' USING CNV2GREG-I-O-AREA.

       d.   If VALID-INPUT-DATE = 'YES'
                 the date was valid and the
                 formatted date is in FORMATTED-DATE
            ELSE
                 the date to be converted is invalid.


  3.   After the CALL, the formatted date is contained in
       FORMATTED-DATE OF CNV2GREG-I-O-AREA.

        The value of 'n' is used to signal what kinds of printing
        will be allowed.  The three ways in which the documents can
        be printed are as follows:

              .  direct print to RJE  (via DEST=RMTxx)
              .  direct print to 3800 Page printer rotated 90 degrees
              .  route print to a local cluster printer


        IF n=1, then a panel will be displayed which will allow all
                three ways to print the dataset

        IF n=2, then a panel will be displayed which will allow the
                dataset to be printed at an RJE or at the 3800 Page
                Printer rotated 90 degrees only

        IF n=3, then a panel will be displayed which will allow the
                dataset to be printed at the 3800 Page Printer rotated
                90 degrees only

  FUNCTION:      Dynamically  add  specified  number  of  directory

  The purpose of this  CLIST is to make it very  easy to expand the
  directory  of  a  PDS.   Without the  ability  to  do  a  dynamic
  expansion of  the directory,  it is  a time  consuming four  step
  process.  The  four step process which  can now be  replaced with
  this one step process was:

       Step 1:   Allocate a new PDS with  a different name and with
                 an increased number of directory blocks (SPF 3.2)

       Step 2:   Copy all members  of original PDS to  this new PDS
                 (SPF 3.3)

       Step 3:   Delete the original PDS (SPF 3.2)

       Step 4:   Rename the new PDS back  to the original name (SPF
                 3.2)

  This CLIST  examines the terminal  type to determine  whether the
  terminal being used to invoke this  CLIST is a 3270 type terminal
  (supporting  Full Screen  services)  or is  a  dialup (TTY)  type
  terminal.

  If the  terminal type is  a 3270  type terminal, then  this CLIST
  invokes  the  Dialog  of  the same  name  (EXPANDIR)  to  do  the
  expansion of the directory.  Therefore,  if your terminal type is
  3270, then  reference the  documentation in  this manual  for the
  Dialog EXPANDIR.

  Therefore,  the  following  documentation   is  for  Dialup  type
  terminals.

  PROGRAM:       INTRDR
  AUTHOR:        Jeff Sprehn
  AGENCY:        WDPSC
  LANGUAGE:      Assembler
  LOCATION:      WDPSC.SHARED.LOAD
  FUNCTION:      Accept a DDNAME and  then dynamically allocate the
                 internal reader.

  RUN MODE:      N/A...this is a subroutine.

  This program is a subroutine which will accept a DDNAME passed to
  it  in  the parameter  list  and  then dynamically  allocate  the
  internal reader to that DDNAME.  This could allow, for example, a
  COBOL program  to submit  a job from  within the  executing COBOL
  program  (by  outputting JCL  to  the  file associated  with  the
  DDNAME).  This could also allow a  CLIST to allocate the internal
  reader.  The TSO  ALLOCATE command currently has  no provision to
  do this.

  To call this program from a CLIST, do the following:

       CALL 'WDPSC.SHARED.LOAD(INTRDR)' '&DDNAME'
            where &DDNAME contains the DDNAME

  To call this subroutine from a program, do the following:

       MOVE the length of your ddname
            TO DDNAME-LENGTH OF INTRDR-I-O-AREA.
       MOVE your ddname
            TO DDNAME OF INTRDR-I-O-AREA.
       CALL 'INTRDR' USING INTRDR-I-O-AREA.
            where:

  PROC NAME:          LOADXREF
  AUTHOR:             Jeff Sprehn

  FUNCTION:           Cross  reference calling  programs to  called
                      program and vice versa.

  This PROCEDURE by simply providing it the DSNAME of a load module
  library(ies) will produce the following:

       1.   CALLING PROGRAM CROSS REFERENCE:

            This report shows the calling programs (in alphabetical
            order)  in the  left  column  and the  called  programs
            (subroutines) in the right column.

       2.   CALLED PROGRAM CROSS REFERENCE

            This report shows the called programs, subroutines, (in
            alphabetical order) in the left  column and the calling
            programs in the right column.

  HOW TO INVOKE THE PROCEDURE:

  1.   Insert the JOBPARM statement with LINECT=90 (The reports are
       produced by the 3800 page printer and are shifted 90 degrees
       to read like a book).

  2.   EXEC  the PROC LOADXREF.

  3.   Supply all of  the load module libraries  required using the
       symbolic variables LIB1,LIB2,LIB3,LIB4,..........LIB15.

  4.   Indicate the  number of copies of  the two reports  that you
       desire.  The symbolic variable COPIES allows you to indicate
       the  number  of  desired  copies.   The  procedure  defaults
       COPIES=1.

  NOTES:

  1.   This procedure will allow up to  15 load module libraries as
       input.  Hence, the intention is  to feed this procedure with
       all of the load module libraries  in your shop.  However, if
       your  shop  has  9  load module  libraries,  then  only  the
       symbolic variables  LIB1 through  LIB9 need  to be  provided
       (the  procedure  defaults  LIB2 through  LIB15  to  a  dummy
       library that will not affect your reports).

    How the Document System works:

  It is an ISPF dialog, of which the highest level is a CLIST
 named DOCSYS (for SPF D) or DOCTECH (for SPF K.D) etc.

  The DOCSYS clist sets variables to establish the high and middle
 default qualifiers for the Document System and the high level index
 member name.

  It then calls via ISPF SELECT the TBLHNDLR dialog program which reads
 the index member from the document system library with last qualifier
 INDEXES and builds a table from the index which is displayed using
 ISPF table services. It accepts S or P selection codes which are
 translated to SEL or PRT and appended to non-displayed data from the
 index to form a clist command which is then invoked via ISPF
 SELECT service.

  The various clists (DOC01SEL,DOC01PRT,DOC03SEL,etc.) examine the data
 passed from the index to locate the document or sub-index requested
 and browse it or recursively invoke TBLHNDLR to display a new index.
 They may print the document or do anything neccessary to search it.

  TBLHNDLR is documented under CTS DOC System as a CTS utility pgm.

    The TECHINFO system works as follows:

  Job SOFTD150.TECHINFO.CNTL(DOCBGET) is submitted every Friday in
 class S. It is a batch TSO job which executes Clist DOCBGET in
 SOFTD150.MISC.CLIST. The DOCBGET Clist allocates the Clist library
 SOFTD150.TECHINFO.CLIST. It then processes a DOCSYS index member
 requested by the job and transforms all selected documents into
 a format loadable by the INFOSYS OZB program and stores them into
 a dataset called SOFTD150.TECHINFO.MAINPDS . If running in the first
 7 days of the month, the job submits job DOCBGETM, otherwise RBLDINFO.

  Job DOCBGETM (same cntl lib) processes a different index member and
 submits job RBLDINFO.

  Job RBLDINFO rebuilds the local INFOSYS database from the updated
 MAINPDS members. The database is SYSVS.SOFTD150.TECHINFO .

  There is also a clist called DOCSTEAL invoked as an ISPF dialog by
 SPF option K.K.D which operates the same as DOCTECH except that
 documents selected with the P option are converted to INFOSYS load
 format and saved.

  PROGRAM:       RJETRANS
  AUTHOR:        Gary Duffield
  AGENCY:        WDPSC
  LANGUAGE:      DYL280
  LOCATION:      N/A
  FUNCTION:      Reassemble records  that have been  transmitted in
                 80 byte segments via RJE to their original logical
                 record length.

  RUN MODE:      BATCH

  This program can be used to input  from one to seven 'user tapes'
  via a Remote Job Entry station.

  Before using  this program,  it must be  'compiled' to  meet your
  input tape  specifications.  Once 'compiled',  it may be  used in
  any  job that  requires  transmission of  'user  tapes' with  the
  specified logical record length and block size.

  For any jobs  using 'user tapes' with a  different logical record
  length  or block  size,  another copy  of  this  program must  be
  compiled to meet its specifications.

  Before compilation, this program is identified as RJETRANS.  When
  you compile it, you may name it whatever you desire.

  To 'compile' RJETRANS, submit the following JCL:

  //    JOBCARD
  //STEP1   EXEC DYL280,COPYLIB='WDPSC.CARD'
  //SYS280FZ  DD DSN=&&OBJECT,DISP=(,PASS),UNIT=SYSDA,
  //             SPACE=(TRK,(5,5))
  //SYSIN     DD *
  OPTION FREEZE XXXXXXXX
  COPY RJETRANS #1=888 #2=9999
  //STEP2   EXEC PGM=IEWL,PARM='LIST,LET'
  //SYSLIN    DD DSN=&&OBJECT,DISP=(OLD,DELETE)
  //SYSLMOD   DD DSN=AAAAAAAA,DISP=SHR
  //SYSUT1    DD UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(TRK,(3,1))
  //SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=A
  //

  Where:

       888       =    Actual input logical record length.

       9999      =    Smallest multiple of 80  that will fully
                      contain the input blocksize.

       XXXXXXXX  =    Name you  want assigned to  the compiled
                      module.

       AAAAAAAA  =    Load  library you  want  the compiled  module
                      placed in.

  Once you have  completed this compile, you may  use the resulting
  module in your  production job stream by  including the following
  JCL:
  //STEPX  EXEC DYL280,PARM='UA=Z'
  //STEPLIB  DD DSN=AAAAAAAA,DISP=SHR
  //IN01     DD *
     YOUR RJE TAPE ASSIGNMENT CONTROL CARDS
       .
       .
       .
  //IN07     DD *
     YOUR RJE TAPE ASSIGNMENT CONTROL CARDS
  //OUTFILE  DD DSN=   (DATASET YOUR WANT OUTPUT PLACED INTO)
  //SYSIN    DD *
  OPTION RESTORE XXXXXXXX

  Where:
       Z         =    Number of input tapes being processed.

       AAAAAAAA  =    Load library  you compiled  your module  into
                      (see previous page of documentation).

       XXXXXXXX  =    Name  of module  you  compiled (see  previous
                      page).

  IMPORTANT:
  _________

  In the case of  multiple input tapes; each tape must  go in under
  its own  separate 'INO_'  DD statement.   You need  only code  an
  'INO_' DD  statement when there is  a tape to be  input following
  it.  All  input tapes to  the step must  have the same  LRECL and
  BLKSIZE.  The  parameter 'Z'  must be  changed to  tell how  many
  tapes  are being  input.  If  this parameter  specifies a  number
  greater than  the number  of 'INO_' DD  statements, a  user abend
  '300' will result.

      ________________________________________________________


          1.  First; the document must be in DLF.  Therefore; ask
              Barb, Kari, Sandy, or Lee (whoever keyed it) to ARC
              (ARCHIVE) it out from ATMS into DLF

          2.  Go to Option '6' of SPF and invoke the CLIST:  DLFTODOC

                 This CLIST will prompt you for:
                      .  Documentation System Library (eg WDPSC.DOCSYS.T

                      .  Document name in DLF
                      .  Class of job

          3.  After the job has run, you may need to edit it if it is mo
              55 records in length.  Put a '1' in column 1 wherever a pa
              is desired.
