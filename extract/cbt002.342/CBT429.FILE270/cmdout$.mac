0Function -
0  The CMDOUT clist is used to allocate a temporary work file for use
 by the calling clist. It can reuse a previous work file allocation if
 it has been set free by "CMDOUT FREE(n)" where "n" is the work file
 number returned by CMDOUT in &LASTCC.

-Operands -
0 DDN(ddname) - causes a given ddname to be used for the allocation. If
      not given, the ddname used is CMDOUTn where "n" is the file
      number returned in &LASTCC.
0 FREE(n)     - causes a previously allocated work file to be marked as
      available for reuse. "n" is the file number returned in &LASTCC
      at time of allocation.
0 MOD         - causes another ddname of CMDOUTnM to be allocated as a
      MOD disposition file.
0 USE(attrlist) - specifies an attribute list name to be used for the
      allocation of the work file.
0 FORCE       - cause any previous allocation of the work file to be
      ignored. The allocation is new.
-Example -
0 If this command is executed:
0  CMDOUT
0 Then a dataset with name prefix.COMMAND.OUTPUTn is allocated to
  ddname CMDOUTn and &LASTCC is set to "n" which is the file number.
-Note -
0 If an error occurs while allocating the file, &LASTCC is set to 99.
  A pre-existing dataset may be used by CMDOUT.
