  This member is an attempt to document or at least list the
pieces of the "better edit" system used here at WA St. DIS.
This system has been requested often by people who visited or
worked at DIS for a while then moved on to another installation.
Unfortunately, no one knows quite what all of the pieces are
since this was an evolved set of systems which made use of a lot
of the mods already installed here. I have finally attempted to
track down the various pieces and make sure they are all on our
WASHMODS tape. Please let me know if you find any pieces missing
and I will try to find them.
  This system or set of systems represents several years of work
to implement the object-action oriented mode of user interface,
even before IBM was talking about SAA components. We first developed
the original "Better Edit" system, now known as EDITNEW, because
after using ISPF/PDF for a short time, any regular user knows what
the edit function does; He just has trouble remembering what datasets
he is currently working with. EDITNEW offered a screen which
remembered 17 dataset names (best we could do with 24 line screens)
for the user to select from for editing. This was fine, but many of
us worked on multiple systems at once and need more datasets with
segregation by system (application). EDITAPP was created to add
another level of selection with 17 applications, each then having
17 datasets remembered in the profile. Many enhancements were added
over time, such as different EDIT select panels which supported
volsers for software groups, up and down scrolling between
applications and various member search options, eventually even the
FLIST function of HOTKEYS.
  The needs of the customers varied from the staff needs, however,
so the technical people supporting them created an edit system
which is completely different and far more comprehensive, replacing
almost all of the ISPF/PDF functions with object-action interface
and adding many extensions such as VSAM browse/edit. This system is
called the "Edit Workbench" and is used extensively by our customers
and development staff. I do not know how it works, but I think it uses
a lot of command table, panel exit, and SUPERKEYS facilities to give
fast access to various functions. It has scrollable access to many
dataset names and user defined functions. I am making no attempt to
add this variety of EDIT to the tape at this time. Perhaps later.

  Here are the components so far identified for the EDITNEW and EDITAPP
systems:
PANELS:
       ISR@PRIM - selects optional user edit clist
       SPFEOPT - allows user to specify type of edit (and other opts)
       MULTEDIT,MULTSOFT - default and special edit panels
       EDITAPP - application selection panel.
       SPFYFND2,FNDSMEM - search panels
CLISTS:
       EDITAPP - starts multi-application interface
       EDITNEW - starts multi-dataset interface
       SPFEOPT - sets user options from panel
       FNDSMEM,SPFYFND - special search functions
SOURCE:
       DPSCEDT6 - last version of better edit dialog (COBOL)
       PANLEXIT - FLIST interface (note SPFEXEC is real pgm name)
       SCAN4HIT,BREAKDSN,FILEATTR,FINDMEM - subroutines for DPSCEDT6
       DEVTYPE,STACK,FINDEM,SPFYFND5 - search subroutines
LOADMODS:
       PANLEXIT,DPSCEDT6,FINDEM,SPFYFND5,DEVTYPE,STACK
TABLES:
       ISPCMDS
MESSAGES:
       TRIK10,WDED10,FNDS10,SPFY10
