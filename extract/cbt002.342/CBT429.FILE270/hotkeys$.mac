HOTKEYS is an ISPF CLIST dialog which sets the ISPF function keys
        so that they will call various functions such as browse, edit,
        library, PDS command, etc. and pass a dataset name found at
        the cursor location when the key was pressed. In other words,
        you move your cursor somewhere onto a dataset name, even in
        some data you are editing/browsing, and hit the key and
        presto! You are now editing/browsing, etc. the new dataset.
        When you are done, you press END or RETURN and you are back
        where you started.
          A line of PFKey definitions is displayed at the bottom of
        your screen, but this may be turned off with command
        "PFSHOW OFF" without affecting the HOTKEYS.
          If you only have 12 PFKeys then you can set one to select
        the "HOTKEY MENU" which allows you to alter the dataset name
        and specify which function you need.
          The letter "U" may be entered in the command field prior to
        pressing the HOTKEY PFKey for some functions. This will allow
        you to change the dataset name or select alternate functions.
          The HOTKEY PFKeys work from most ISPF panels.

SYNTAX -
        HOTKEYS ON    HI   MENU(nn)
                OFF   LOW

       default is ON, HI

       ON  - means turn HOTKEYS on.
       OFF - means restore PFKeys to state prior to HOTKEYS ON.
       HI  - means use PFKeys in range 13-24 for HOTKEYS.
       LOW - means use PFKeys in range 1-12 for HOTKEYS.
       MENU(nn) - means only set PFKey nn to the HOTKEY menu.


USAGE NOTES:

     1. Since HOTKEYS changes the PFKey definitions, in order to
       use it under dialog applications which change the APPLID,
       such as FILEAID, IOF, etc., it is neccessary to turn it on
       while under these applications with TSO %HOTKEYS ON.

     2. Some of the HOTKEY functions such as LIB (3.1) may not support
       recursive entry, although EDIT and BROWSE now do.

     3. The copy function requires you to select two datasets before
       the copy utility is called. The copy PFKey initially is labeled
       "FROM". After selecting a dataset, the label changes to "TO",
       which indicates that the next use of the key will designate
       the destination dataset and invoke the copy utility. An "R"
       may be entered in the command field to copy with replace.

INSTALLATION NOTES:

     1. Changes to some ISPF panels are required to allow automatic
       entry to ISPF functions with a passed DSNAME. I have enclosed
       copies of my ISRUDA1, ISRUMC1, ISRUMC2A, ISRUMC2B panels.

     2. Some of the other mods on this tape are required to support
       HOTKEYS. Also PDS and URZAP from the CBT mods tape are needed
       for some of the options. Change the code which checks to see
       if the user is authorized to have URZAP in clist HOTKEYS.

     3. As sent, FILEAID is required for the INFO key, but this
       can be changed to use ISPF 3.2 easily.
