  PROGRAM:       PFKEYRST
  AUTHOR:        Gary Duffield
  AGENCY:        DIS
  LANGUAGE:      COBOL
  LOCATION:      Located in a "system library".  That is, it can be
                 executed without supplying STEPLIB.
  FUNCTION:      Used with Dialog Manager to "restore" the users PF
                 Key  definitions to  their  original values  after
                 program PFKEYCHG  modified them.  This program  is
                 used in conjunction with PFKEYCHG.

  RUN MODE:      Used under Dialog Manager only.

  The  purpose  of  this  program  is   to  "restore"  the  PF  Key
  definitions  back to  their  original  values after  the  program
  PFKEYCHG was used to temporarily change them.

  This program  is usually executed in  the closing routine  in the
  Dialog.  This program is used  in conjunction with PFKEYCHG.  For
  a discussion  on how to use  the program PFKEYCHG,  reference the
  documentation in this manual for that program.

  HOW TO INVOKE THIS PROGRAM:

       ISPEXEC SELECT PGM(PFKEYRST)
