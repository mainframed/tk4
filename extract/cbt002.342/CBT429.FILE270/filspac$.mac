  PROGRAM:       FILSPACE
  AUTHOR:        Jeff Sprehn
  AGENCY:        WDPSC
  LANGUAGE:      Assembler
  LOCATION:      WDPSC.SHARED.LOAD
  FUNCTION:      Subroutine that accepts a dataset name and volume
                 serial number and returns the number of used extents
                 and the number of used tracks.


  This program is a subroutine that accepts a dataset name and the
  volume serial number that is passed to it and returns to the invoker
  the number of used extents and the number of used tracks.

  To use this subroutine, do the following:

     1.  Place the following data area in the WORKING-STORAGE:

         01  FILSPACE-I-O-AREA.
             05  FILLER                    PIC X(02).
             05  IN-DSN                    PIC X(44).
             05  IN-VOL-SER                PIC X(06).
             05  OUT-NO-OF-USED-EXTENTS    PIC 9(2).
             05  OUT-NO-OF-USED-TRACKS     PIC 9(5).

     2.  Place the following code in the PROCEDURE DIVISION:

         MOVE the dataset name
           TO IN-DSN OF FILSPACE-I-O-AREA.

         MOVE the volume serial number
           TO IN-VOL-SER OF FILSPACE-I-O-AREA.

         CALL 'FILSPACE' USING FILSPACE-I-O-AREA.
