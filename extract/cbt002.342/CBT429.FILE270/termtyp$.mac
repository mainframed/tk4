  PROGRAM:       TERMTYPE
  AUTHOR:        Kermit Kiser
  AGENCY:        WDPSC
  LANGUAGE:      Assembler
  LOCATION:      WDPSC.SHARED.LOAD
  FUNCTION:      Determine if a TSO user's  terminal is a 3270 type
                 terminal or not.

  RUN MODE:      Interactive only

  TERMTYPE  is  a  program  which  can be  called  by  a  CLIST  or
  application program  executing under TSO to  find out if  the TSO
  user's terminal is a 3270  type terminal.  A non-zero return-code
  indicates a 3270 terminal.

  To call from a CLIST:
       CALL 'WDPSC.SHARED.LOAD(TERMTYPE)'

  To call from a COBOL Program:
       Call 'TERMTYPE'.

  NOTE:     If the  return code is  not zero,  it is the  number of
            lines on the 3270 screen, which is normally 24.
