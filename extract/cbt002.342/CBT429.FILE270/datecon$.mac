       This command returns  three CLIST variables to  the invoking
       CLIST to use:

       &STADATE
       &JULDATE
       &SERDATE

  The standard date is returned in &STADATE
  The Julian date is returned in   &JULDATE
  The serial date is returned in   &SERDATE

  DEFINITION OF STANDARD, JULIAN, AND SERIAL DATES:

  o    A  standard date  is a  six (6)  digit numeric  of the  form
       MMDDYY (such as 122581).

  o    A Julian date is a five (5)  digit numeric of the form YYDDD
       where  YY is  the  year and  DDD is  a  three digit  numeric
       representing  the displacement  from the  beginning of  that
       year.

  o    A serial date is a five (5)  digit numeric of the form NNNNN
       representing  the displacement  from  the  beginning of  the
       twentieth century.  For  example, January 1, 1900  is serial
       date 00001, January 2, 1900 is serial date 00002, January 1,
       1901 is serial date 00366 (since  1900 was not a leap year),
       and so on.

  Serial date is a very useful tool  when one wishes to compute the
  days elapsed between two dates in time when the years may differ.
  Julian date will not serve this purpose well.  For example; using
  Julian dates there would be 636 elapsed days between December 31,
  1979 and  January 1,  1980 (80001 -  79365 =  636) where  in fact
  there is  only 1.   Using serial dates  rather than  Julian would
  yield the correct answer of 1.

  EXAMPLE:

  In a CLIST, determine whether the  date that the user has entered
  (which is stored in CLIST variable &USERDATE) is more than 5 days
  into the future.  If it is, inform  him that his date is invalid,
  and prompt him for the date again:
