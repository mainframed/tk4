INCLUDED ARE:

  TABLES AND JOBS NECESSARY TO GET SMF TYPE 32 TSO COMMAND ACCOUNTING
  RECORDS RUNNING. USEFULL TO SEE WHAT RESOURCES OEM TSO PRODUCTS USE.

  A FEW PDF EDIT MACROS AND HELP MEMBERS. A PDF FRONT END FOR
  DYNASOFTS TSO WORDPROCESSOR AND SPREADSHEET. A PRIMARY PDF PANEL
  THAT CAN SCROLL IN ALL FOUR DIRECTIONS TO ALLOW DISPLAY OF LOTS
  PDF OPTIONS.

  A COUPLE OF ACF2 ASM ROUTINES TO DO RESOURCE VALIDATION AND
  INQUERY FUNCTIONS.

  VERISON OF CLIP THAT WORKS WITH DSF REL9 AND XA OR 370.

  TO JES EXITS. ONE PROVIDES A MASKABLE VERISON OF $D'NAME*** .
  WAS A SOURCE MOD TO HASPCOMM RE-WRIITEN AS AN EXIT.
  EXIT FOUR ALLOWS FOR CODING DSN= ON SETUP CARDS. EXIT CONVERTS
  DSN NAMES TO VOLSER'S SO USER DOES NOT HAVE TO LOOK THEM UP. SOME
  LOCAL CODE IN THIS BUT WOULD BE EASY TO DROP OR CHANGE.

  MVS/XA MOD TO INSTALL CUSTOM CONSOLE PFK DEFINITIONS. ONE SAMPLE
  DEFINITIONS INCLUDED . THIS ALLOWS FOR SIMPLE RE-DEFINES ARE GENS
  OR MAINTENANCE. WE HAVE TEN CONSOLES SO THIS HELPS.

  MVS/XA MOD TO ALLOW RESTART OF JOBS THAT USE GDG'S AND REFER
  TO THEM AS +1 IN LATER STEPS.
  WITHOUT THIS MOD JOBS RESTARTED WOULD HAVE TO HAVE ALL
  REFERENCRES TO +1 CHANGED TO 0.  THIS IS AN ERROR PRONE AND
  TIME CONSUMING TASK. TESTED AND RUNNING UNDER XA 2.1.7 DFP 2.2.3.
  THIS IS A VERY STABLE MOD. HAS NOT CHANGE SIZE OF LOCATION IN
  YEARS. LAST CHANGE WAS A "DISPLACEMEMNT" CHANGE WHEN SIZE OF
  MODULE WAS CHANGED.

  SWTSO          SOURCE CODE TO SMF FRONT END PGM. THIS IS A
                 GENERAL PURPOSE PGM WHICH SETS UP THE SMF32
                 ENVIORNMENT. BECAUSE OF INTERNAL WB STANDARDS
                 A LMODLIB DD STATEMENT IS REQUIRED. THE CODE
                 COULD VERY EASILY BE ADDED TO DYNAPLAN OR
                 THE FRONTEND PGM SUPPLIED AS A USER OPTION.
                 THE SVC STARTS AND STOPS SMF32 ACCOUNTING.
  TRAP           EDIT MACRO. WILL TRAP THE OUTPUT OF A TSO CP
                 AND PLACE IT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE CURRENT EDIT
                 DATASET. GOOD EXAMPLE OF SOME OF THE NEAT
                 THINGS YOU CAN DO UNDER TSO/E. WILL ONLY
                 WORK WITH TSO CP'S THAT US PUTLINE. WILL NOT
                 WORK WITH FULLSCREEN TPUT'S.
  VPS            EDIT MACRO. QUICK WAY TO GET A VPSPINT OF
                 CURRENT EDIT DATA. NOTE: DOES A SAVE FIRST.
                 THIS TECHNIQUE COULD BE USED FOR ANY TSOCP OR
                 UTILITY.
