To install the $6 exec, do the following:

   o   Copy ISRTSOA to a data set (FB, LRECL=80).  This panel is a
       modified copy of the IBM ISRTSOA.  The only difference is that
       the Loadlib data set name will be displayed so that you know
       this is not the native ISPF Option 6.

       NOTE ****** DO NOT COPY THIS TO A SYSTEM ISPF PANEL DATA SET, OR
       IT WILL BE DISPLAYED BY ANYONE USING ISPF OPTION 6.

       Make a note of the data set name where you copied this member to.

   o   Copy $6 to the system CLIST data set.

   o   Modify the $6 Exec and change $VNV.CBT.PDS to the new dsname.


Syntax for $6:

       $6 LoadlibDsname
