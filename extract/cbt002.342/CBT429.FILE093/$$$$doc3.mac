          Here included is an updated source deck of OFFLOADW from
          CBT file 93.  It should now handle any LRECL from 1 to 256
          inclusive, and if the T=IEBUPDTE operand is specified
          then any appropriate SSI and ISPF statistics userdata is
          also output in IEBUPDTE/PDSLOAD format.

          Just a reminder that as well as =OFFLOAD in REVIEW
          (CBT tape file 134) there is =SEQLOAD which can
          convert a PDS's members to a sequential data file
          without any ./ control statements.  This is the same
          as the OFFLOAD program when run without any T= operand
          on its O statement.

          You may want to update your VIP file 7 on the VIP tape
          with the latest levels of PDSLOAD/OFFLOAD.  At any rate,
          Marty Kuntz could now ship ISPF statistics on the tape
          if he wanted to.
