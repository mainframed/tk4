 Fix for problem from STARTOOL's COMBINE subcommand.

   (Henceforth from this time, STARTOOL will use the LISTPDS
   format for expressing the ISPF stats in its COMBINE command.)

           13FEB00 - STARTOOL'S "COMBINE" SUBCOMMAND PUTS
                     ISPF STATISTICS RECORDS INTO THE ./ ADD
                     CARDS DIFFERENTLY THAN LISTPDS AND
                     REVIEW.  PDSLOAD IS BEING MODIFIED TO
                     RECOGNIZE EITHER FORMAT, AND TO BE ABLE
                     TO RE-CONSTITUTE THE ISPF STATS NO
                     MATTER WHICH UTILITY WAS USED TO CREATE
                     THEM, INSIDE THE ./ ADD NAME=XXXX CARDS.

       WHAT "STARTOOL COMBINE" WAS DOING, THE DIFFERENCE
       IS AS FOLLOWS:   "CREATE DATE" AND "MODIFY DATE"
       ARE GIVEN SEVEN CHARACTERS INSTEAD OF FIVE, THAT IS:

         CCYYDDD , INSTEAD OF YYDDD .

       THIS INTRODUCES FOUR EXTRA CHARACTERS.  IF YOU HAVE
       A 7-CHARACTER USERID, A NON-BLANK WILL BE SHOVED INTO
       COLUMN 72, RENDERING THE MEMBER UN-STOWABLE BY IBM'S
       IEBUPDTE.  IEBUPDTE TREATS THE NON-BLANK IN COLUMN 72
       AS A CONTINUATION CHARACTER, AND EXPECTS ANOTHER
       CONTROL CARD ON THE NEXT LINE.  AT LEAST PDSLOAD WILL
       NOW BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH THIS SITUATION PROPERLY.

       I'VE ENTERED AN APAR WITH BRUCE LELAND OF STARTOOL
       SUPPORT.  BUT THE OLD SEQUENTIAL DATASETS THAT HAVE
       BEEN CREATED WITH EXISTING RELEASES OF STARTOOL, IN
       ITS FORMAT, STILL HAVE TO BE DEALT WITH.

   LISTPDS format of ISPF stats in ./ ADD NAME=xxxxxxxx cards:

    IN ORDER FOR SPF STATISTICS TO BE STORED, THE './ ADD'
    STATEMENT MUST LOOK LIKE THIS:

       COL     DESCRIPTION
       1-20    ./ ADD NAME=XXXXXXXX
       21      BLANK
       22-71   VVMM-YYDDD-YYDDD-HHMM-NNNNN-NNNNN-NNNNN-UUUUUUUUUU
               VER CREATE LASTMOD TIME SIZE INIT   MOD   ID

   But STARTOOL COMBINE format that is created in the ./ ADD
   cards looks like this:

       COL     DESCRIPTION
       1-20    ./ ADD NAME=XXXXXXXX
       21      BLANK
       22-75   VVMM-CCYYDDD-CCYYDDD-HHMM-NNNNN-NNNNN-NNNNN-UUUUUUUUUU
               VER  CREATE  LASTMOD TIME SIZE  INIT   MOD   ID

   PDSLOAD was modified to recognize either format, and to restore
   ISPF statistics from either format.
