                      UPDTE AND UNUPDTE PROGRAMS

     The UPDTE and UNUPDTE programs were lifted from the PL1 MODS
TAPE that can be obtained from SPLA (order number 370D-03.2.019).

     These programs are more flexible than PDSLOADW and OFFLOADW in
that:

         1.  They handle RECFM=F and also RECFM=V datasets.
         2.  The dataset can have ANY LRECL permitted by the system.

     Processing with these programs SEQUENTIALIZES A PDS by loading
each member to a sequential dataset, preceded by a control record that
looks like   ./  ADD NAME=membname    , similar to an IEBUPDTE control
card.

     The program UNUPDTE converts a partitioned dataset into sequential
format described by the preceding paragraph.  The program UPDTE loads
the sequentialized dataset of the above format back into a PDS that has
the same DCB attributes (except for DSORG of course).

     It is also advantageous to have PDSLOADW and OFFLOADW around,
because they have some options which UPDTE and UNUPDTE do not have,
such as automatically converting the string ./ WITHIN a member (in
columns 1-2) to some other string, such as ><.  Therefore I am including
both pairs of programs in this package.

     JCL to run these programs is of the same format as IEBUPDTE JCL,
to the point where each program mimics the function of IEBUPDTE.  For
instance, UNUPDTE, which unloads a PDS to a sequential dataset, has
DDcards SYSPRINT, SYSUT1, and SYSUT2.  UPDTE, which does the opposite,
has control cards SYSPRINT, SYSIN, and SYSUT2.  You get the picture.

     These four programs (two pairs) taken together, provide powerful
tools for sequentialization of partitioned datasets.
