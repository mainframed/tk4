One example of how UTILITY can be used:

JCL:

//DELETE  PROC  MEMBER=,DSN=
//STEPNAME  EXEC  PGM=UTILITY,
//    PARM='IEHPROGM,&MEMBER,&DSN'
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
//VOL1     DD  DSN=&DSN,DISP=SHR
//CONTROL  DD  DSN=IEHPROGM.CTL(DELETE),DISP=SHR
//SYSIN    DD  UNIT=VIO,SPACE=(TRK,1)
//VOLUME01 DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=&DSN

The member of IEHPROGM.CTL would look like this:

 SCRATCH MEMBER=&0,VOL=SYSALLDA=&L,                                    x
               DSNAME=&1

If the EXEC statement for this proc was this:

//  EXEC DELETE,DSN=SYS1.LINKLIB,MEMBER=TEMPNAME

and the dataset SYS1.LINKLIB resided on volume RESPAC, then the control
statement for IEHPROGM would look like this:

 SCRATCH  MEMBER=TEMPNAME,VOL=SYSALLDA=RESPAC,                        x
                DSNAME=SYS1.LINKLIB

And that's the actual statement that IEHPROGM would receive.  I'm sure
that other readers can envision more decorative examples but I'm only
trying to demonstrate the basic functions.

I have, on several occaissions, used this mechanism to pump JCL directly
into the JES2 internal reader.  Simply point the SYSIN DD statement at
the internal reader directly and invoke a program that does nothing, suc
as IEFBR14.

When you write this up, please give proper credit to Mike Eager, since h
wrote the original program; I only modified it.

You may add this to the tape, as long as you associate BOTH names.
