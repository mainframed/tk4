   CYLINDERS AND THE LARGARET EXTENT AVAILABLE, NUMBER OF FREE EXTENTS
   AND PERCENT OF SPACE ALLOCATED FOR EACH PACK.  WITH A FINAL TOTAL FOR
   TRACKS AVAILABLE AND TOTAL TRACKS ALLOCATED.

   YOU NEED SIMPLY CREATE AN 80 CHARACTER CONTROL CARD SPECIFYING WHICH
   PACKS YOU WANT TO REPORT ON.  IF YOU USE 'PARM=MISSMSG' ON YOUR
   EXECUTE LINE IT WILL GIVE YOU A MESSAGE THAT A VOLUME SPECIFIED IS
   MISSING OR OFFLINE AND WILL RETURN A CONDITION CODE OF '4'.
