  THIS TSO ISPF PANEL DRIVEN UTILITY HAS BEEN IMPROVED FROM PREVIOUS
  VERSIONS ON THE PAST UTILITY TAPES.  THIS UTILITY ALLOWS YOU TO
  CREATE, DELETE OR MODIFY GDG INDEXES.  AS AN EXAMPLE, SAY YOU HAVE AN
  INDEX BUILT WITH 3 ENTRY LIMITS AND YOU WANT TO CHANGE IT TO 10 ENTRY
  LIMITS.  THIS PANEL WILL AUTOMATICALLY CHANGE ANY EXISTING ENTRIES
  WHETHER THEY HAVE CATALOGED ENTRIES OR NOT.  YOU CAN ALSO LIST GDG
  INFORMATION (SHORT OR MORE DETAILED) ABOUT YOU BLDGS DATA SETS.
  YOU CAN DELETE BLDG INDEXES BUT ALL GENERATIONS MUST BE DELETED BEFORE
  ENTRY IS DELETED.

  THIS PANEL IS SET FOR COLOR MONITORS, BUT IS NOT NECESSARY IF YOU DO
  NOT HAVE ONE.
