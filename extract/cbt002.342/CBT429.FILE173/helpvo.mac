)F    FUNCTION - TO ENABLE OPERATOR PRIVILEGED USERS THE ABILITY TO
              ENTER ACF/VTAM COMMANDS FROM TSO TERMINALS.

)X    SYNTAX - VO


   DESCRIPTION -

     THE PURPOSE OF THIS COMMAND IS TO ENABLE OPERATOR AUTHORIZED
   USERS TO ENTER ACF/VTAM COMMANDS FROM TSO TERMINALS.  THIS IS
   PARTICULARLY HELPFUL WHEN ONE IS WORKING ON A FAULTY TERMINAL
   FROM A REMOTE LOCATION.  ALL IT REQUIRES IS A SEPARATE TSO TUBE.

     VO PRESENTS THE USER WITH A FULL-SCREEN MENU INTO WHICH HE/SHE
   CAN ENTER ACF/VTAM COMMANDS SUCH AS VARY, MODIFY, AND DISPLAY.
   THE RESULTS ARE RETURNED ON A SEPARATE SCREEN, WHICH CANNOT BE
   CHANGED.  AFTER THE USER VIEWS THE RESULT OF THE FIRST OPERATION,
   PRESSING ENTER WILL CAUSE VO TO RETURN TO THE ORIGINAL MENU.

     THE VARY AND MODIFY COMMANDS DO NOT GENERATE MESSAGES, SO VO
   JUST ACKNOWLEDGES RECEIPT OF THE INPUT.  TO SEE WHAT REALLY
   HAPPENED, DO A DISPLAY COMMAND ON THE DEVICE THAT YOU ARE WORKING
   WITH AND CHECK THE RESULTS.

     THERE IS A KNOWN PROBLEM WITH THE COMMAND THAT IF YOU TYPE IN
   AN UNRECOGNIZABLE KEYWORD OR INVALID NETWORK NAME, VO WILL HANG
   ON A RCVCMD MACRO.  IF THIS APPEARS TO HAVE HAPPENED, (RESPONSE
   TIME OVER 5-10 SECONDS, PRESS ATTN AND VO WILL BREAK OUT AND
   YOU CAN THEN GET BACK IN.

     IF YOU ARE REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT DOING THIS KIND OF THING, YOU
   MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER ACQUIRING NCCF/NPDA/NPA.

)O    OPERANDS - NONE, OTHER THAN AS SPECIFIED ABOVE
