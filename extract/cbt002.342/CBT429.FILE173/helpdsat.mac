)F    FUNCTION - DISPLAY THE ATTRIBUTES OF A DATASET ON IBM 3278/9
              CRT TERMINALS IN FULL-SCREEN MODE.

)X    SYNTAX - DSAT DSNAME (-VOLSER) (:)


   DESCRIPTION -

     THE DSNAME OPERAND IS REQUIRED.  APOSTRAPHES ARE REQUIRED ONLY IF
   THE DATASET IS NOT CATALOGED UNDER YOUR USERID (OR PROFILE PREFIX).
   IF ENTERING APOSTRAPHES, ONLY THE FIRST IS REQUIRED.

     IF THE DATASET IS NOT CATALOGED, YOU MUST ENTER THE DSN FOLLOWED
   BY A DASH, FOLLOWED BY THE NAME OF THE VOLUME TO BE SEARCHED.  THERE
   MUST BE NO SPACES BETWEEN THE DASH AND THE VOLSER.

     IF YOU WANT EXTENT INFORMATION, ENTER A COLON (:) AFTER THE DSNAME
   OR VOLSER.  YOU WILL NOT SEE THE EXTENTS ON THE ORIGINAL SCREEN.
   RATHER, AFTER VIEWING THE PRIMARY SCREEN, WHEN YOU PRESS ENTER, THE
   EXTENTS WILL BE DISPLAYED IN SINGLE LINE MODE.

     YOU CAN "STACK" ANOTHER DSAT REQUEST BY MODIFYING THE DSNAME FIELD
   AT THE TOP OF THE OUTPUT SCREEN.  SIMPLY MAKE WHATEVER CHANGES ARE
   NECESSARY, THEN PRESS ENTER.

     IF YOU WANT A HARD-COPY OF THE SCREEN, YOU CAN GET IT BY SIMPLY
   ALLOCATING A PRINT DATASET TO THE DDNAME "DSATPRNT" PRIOR TO USING
   THE COMMAND.  THE DCB ATTRIBUTES OF THE PRINT DATASET MUST BE:

     DSORG=PS, RECFM=FBA, LRECL=133

     IF YOU ALLOCATE THE DATASET "SHR", DSAT WILL WRITE OVER THE ENTIRE
   DATASET EVERY TIME IT IS CALLED.  YOU CAN STACK THE HARD-COPY BY
   SIMPLY ALLOCATING THE DATASET "MOD".  YOU CAN THEN PRINT THIS
   DATASET USING IEBGENER.  EACH REQUEST WILL PRINT ON A SEPARATE PAGE.

)O    OPERANDS - NONE, OTHER THAN AS SPECIFIED ABOVE
