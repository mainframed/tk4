*    Welcome!  This is a collection of useful TSO commands and batch  *
*    utilities.  They are easily assemblable.  They are all self-     *
*    contained, with no external references or macro libraries        *
*    required (other than MACLIB and AMODGEN).  They are all serially *
*    reusable only, and do not require LPA residence.  I recommend    *
*    that you put them in SYS2.CMDLIB or equivalent.                  *
*                                                                     *
*    In order to cut down on multiple versions with through "creeping *
*    functionalism", please notify me of significant additions and I  *
*    will re-publish the original.                                    *
