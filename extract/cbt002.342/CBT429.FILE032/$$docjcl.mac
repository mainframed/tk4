              DOCUMENTATION FOR JCLSCAN TSO COMMAND PROCESSOR


      This highly convenient program calls MVS's JCL converter
 to report JCL errors in a jobstream on your TSO tube.  It is the
 same program which checks the errors when you run a real jobstream
 with TYPRUN=SCAN.  The output has been massaged to make it more
 convenient to display on the terminal.  All syntax errors are found,
 but "DATASET NOT FOUND"-type errors, which are produced by the
 JCL interpreter, are not shown by this processing, which is done
 by the JCL CONVERTER.

      The program consists of two parts:  the TSO command processor
called JCLSCAN, and a user SVC, which does all the dirty work of calling
the MVS JCL CONVERTER.  The SVC is type 4.

      To use the program, just execute the TSO command:

            JCLSCAN 'dataset-name'

      This program was found on a large file of utilities submitted to
the CBT tape from MEMOREX.  It may be found on versions 260 and older.
The file was file 313 on those versions of the CBT tape.  That file
contained over 100,000 lines of code, and contains many old but still
useful utilities.  You may have to tell some of them that 3380 or even
3350 disk drives exist, but once this is done, many of these programs
still work.  The file is much worth exploring.  It was deleted from
version 261 of the CBT tape.


      Version 249 of the CBT tape, which may be obtained from SHARE,
(see file 1 of the current CBT tape for instructions how to order it)
has this material on file 313.
