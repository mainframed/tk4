                  Documentation for COPYPACK Program


     This program has powerful capabilities to copy groups of datasets
from one disk pack to another.  Basically, PO and PS record-format
are supported.  Allocation of the new copy is done automatically,
and recataloging is optional.  This program can save a lot of work
for you in certain situations.  Documentation for its use is in the
code.  The program came from the MEMOREX file, file 313 of CBT tape
versions 260 and previous.

     Example of use:  copy all SYS1.**  datasets from MVSRES pack
to WORK01 pack for backup copy during a system change.
