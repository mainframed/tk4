                USING THE "MESSAGE PROCESSING FACILITY"
                  OTHERWISE KNOWN AS "MANY WTO EXITS"

 ENCLOSED ARE SEVERAL WTO EXITS WRITTEN ACCORDING TO THE STANDARDS OF
 THE "MESSAGE PROCESSING FACILITY" UNDER MVS/SP2.1.2.  THESE EXITS HAVE
 REPLACED "R2D2" FROM THE CB&T TAPE.  OTHER FEATURES OF "R2D2" ARE NOT
 USED AT OUR CENTER.  NO CHANGE WAS MADE TO RUN UNDER MVS/SP2.1.3.

 THE EXITS MUST BE ASSEMBLED AS "RENT,NOALIGN" AND LINK-EDITED WITH THE
 OPTIONS "RENT,REUS" INTO THE LINK LIST.  THE "MPFLSTxx" MUST BE IN
 SYS1.PARMLIB AND AN ENTRY MADE IN "IEASYSxx".

 THESE EXITS CAN ABEND ANYWHERE AND NOT CAUSE ANY PROBLEMS.  THE ONLY
 PROBLEM THAT I HAVE NOTICED IN IMPLEMENTING ANY MPF EXIT IS THAT THE
 IEZMGCR MACRO FROM IBM MUST HAVE AN "ORG" IMMEDIATELY AFTER IT TO
 PREVENT PROBLEMS.

 IF "IEAVMXIT" IS LINKED INTO THE LINKLIST, IT WILL BE USED.  IT NEEDS
 NO ENTRY IN "MPFLSTxx".

 MOST OF THE EXITS ARE SELF-EXPLANATORY.  THE ONES THAT ARE IMPLEMENTED
 NOW ARE:
          WTODB103  WTO EXIT- DATACOM/DB BACKOUT MESSAGE
          WTOD1001  WTO EXIT TO SCHEDULE DATACOM PXX CLEAR TASK
          WTOECVT   MACRO TO STORE FIELDS FROM IMS /DIS A
          WTOEDB30  WTO EXIT TO DUMP DATACOM-DB LOG
          WTOEF97I  WTO EXIT TO SUPPRESS MSG IEF097I
          WTOEIUTL  WTO EXIT TO ISSUE IMS /DIS A
          WTOEI000  WTO EXIT TO INTERPRET IMS /DIS A
          WTOEI554  WTO EXIT TO INTERPRET IMS /DIS A
          WTOEI996  WTO EXIT TO SAVE IMS REPLY NUMBER
          WTOENROL  WTO EXIT TO STOP A MESSAGE FROM ROLLING
          WTOERD    WTOR EXIT TO REPLY "D" TO MESSAGE
          WTOERHLD  WTOR EXIT TO REPLY "HOLD" TO MSG IEF225D
          WTOERM    WTOR EXIT TO REPLY "M" TO MESSAGE
          WTOERNHL  WTOR EXIT TO REPLY "NOHOLD" TO MESSAGE
          WTOEROLL  WTO EXIT TO CAUSE A MESSAGE TO ROLL
          WTOERU    WTOR EXIT TO REPLY "U" TO MESSAGE
          WTOERWAT  WTOR EXIT TO REPLY "WAIT" TO MESSAGE
          WTOERY    WTOR EXIT TO REPLY "Y"
          WTOER301  WTOR EXIT TO REPLY "JOBNAME" TO IEC301A
          WTOETPS1  WTO EXIT TO CAPTURE TAPE UNLOAD DATA
          WTOETPS2  WTO EXIT TO DISPLAY TAPE UNLOADED DATA
×         WTOEUCVT  WTO EXIT TO CREATE A USER CVT IF NONE EXISTS
          WTOE176I  WTO EXIT TO STOP EXTERNAL WRITER
          WTOE315I  PROCESS NPM MSGFNM315I AT SHUTDOWN
          WTOE362A  WTO EXIT TO DUMP AN SMF MANX DATASET

 THE TWO EXITS "WTOETPSn" ARE USED TO STORE THE LAST TAPE USED ON EACH
 TAPE DRIVE AND DISPLAY IT FOR THE OPERATOR WHEN ANOTHER MOUNT FOR
 THAT TAPE IS ISSUED.  THE MESSAGE IS "TAPE XXXXXX MAY STILL BE ON
 DRIVE XXX".  THIS WAS DESIGNED FOR THE IBM 3480 TAPE DRIVE WITH THE
 TAPE STACKER FEATURE BECAUSE IT CAN HOLD SIX "USED" TAPES PER DRIVE.
 IN OUR SHOP, THAT WORKS OUT TO A MAXIMUM OF 148 TAPES THAT ARE STILL
 ON THE TAPE DRIVES (UP FROM 28 BEFORE THE TAPE STACKER FEATURE) AND
 EFFECTIVELY LOST AS FAR AS THE TAPE OPERATORS ARE CONCERNED.  THE
 TAPE CONFIGURATION MUST BE ASSEMBLED INTO THE WTOETPS1 EXIT WITH THE
 INTERNALLY DEFINED "STRING" MACRO.  THE TABLE TO HOLD THE TAPE VOLUME
 SERIAL NUMBER AND THE TAPE DRIVE ADDRESS IS IN EXTENDED CSA. THE TABLE
×IS POINTED TO BY A FIELD IN OUR USERCVT (SEE WTOEUCVT) THAT IS ANCHORED
 IN THE CVTUSER FIELD OF THE MVS CVT.  THE EXITS DO A LOT OF VALIDITY
 CHECKING SO EITHER EXIT CAN BE INSTALLED FIRST.

 THE "WTOEIxxx" EXITS ARE TO AUTOMATICALLY CANCEL IMS BMPS THROUGH THE
 OUTSTANDING REPLY.  THEY DEPEND HEAVILY ON OUR USERCVT AND WILL NOT
 ASSEMBLE WITHOUT IT OR A REPLACEMENT.  THEY ARE INCLUDED AS AN EXAMPLE
 OF WHAT CAN BE DONE USING WTO EXITS TO PROCESS MULTIPLE, ASYNCHRONOUS
 MESSAGES.
