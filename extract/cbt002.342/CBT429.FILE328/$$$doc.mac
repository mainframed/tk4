                        CUNY MOD LM52900


     INSTALL THE CUNY DFP DADSM EXIT ROUTINES (IGGPRE00/IGGPOST0).

                                 * * *

                THE FOLLOWING FUNCTIONS ARE INCLUDED:

         ALLOCATE, RENAME, EXTEND: VALIDATE THE DSNAME (RE LOCAL
                STANDARDS)

         ALLOCATE, RENAME: ENSURE THAT THE DATASET (THE NEW DSNAME,
                FOR RENAME) IS NOT ALREADY CATALOGED ON ANOTHER VOLUME
                AND, IF THE DSNAME IS A GDG NAME, IT HAS A GDG BASE
                ENTRY IN THE CATALOG

         ALLOCATE, EXTEND: CALL RACF TO CHECK AUTHORITY TO CREATE
                DATASETS ON THIS VOLUME; ADD CUNY INFORMATION TO THE
                FORMAT 1 DSCB


                             **  NOTES  **

     THIS CODE USES THE CVT USER FIELD, CVTUSER.

     MODULE IGGPOST0 IS DELETED BY THIS INSTALL.  IGGPOST0 BECOMES
     AN ALIAS ENTRY IN LMOD IGGPRE00, AS THE ROUTINES SHARE MUCH CODE.

*
*
*
*        THIS ROUTINE IS USED TO FORCE ALLOCATION OF A USERCATALOG TO
*        THE *MASTER* ASID FOR LATER USE BY THE DADSM EXIT ROUTINE,
*        IGGPRE00.  DETAILED COMMENTARY IS PROVIDED IN THAT MODULE.
*
*
*        AN ENTRY IN A SYS1.PARMLIB IEFSSNXX MEMBER IS REQUIRED
*        FOR THIS ROUTINE.  THE FORMAT IS
*
*            PRPO,PREPOST0
*
*        THE SUBSYSTEM NAME, "PRPO", IS ARBITRARY (BUT MUST BE UNIQUE).
*
*
*        NOTE THAT ALTHOUGH THIS ROUTINE IS ENTERED FOR SUBSYSTEM
*        INITIALIZATION--FOR CONVENIENCE AND EASE OF INSTALLATION--
*        THE DADSM EXIT IS NOT A SUBSYSTEM (I.E., IT DOES NOT
*        PROCESS IEFSSREQ REQUESTS).  THE SIMPLEST WAY TO NOT BE A
*        SUBSYSTEM IS TO DO NOTHING:  ALLOCATE NO SSVT, AND LEAVE THE
*        SSCTSSVT POINTER ZERO.  HENCE, THESE ARE (NOT) DONE.
