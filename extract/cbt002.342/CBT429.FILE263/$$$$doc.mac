DOC FOR THIS FILE (263).

   THIS FILE CONSISTS OF ALL MEMBERS OF THE OLD UK G.U.I.D.E. TAPE
   WHICH ARE NOT IN THE NEW UK G.U.I.D.E. TAPE WHICH I RECEIVED
   FROM PHIL PECKSEN, WHO IS ITS PROPRIETOR.  I HAVE ASSUMED THAT
   THESE MEMBERS, MOST OF WHICH ARE MACROS, ARE NECESSARY FOR
   ASSEMBLING THE CONTENTS OF FILES 244 AND 245 OF THE CBT TAPE,
   WHICH IS FROM HIM, BUT WHICH CONTAINS FEW LOOSE MACROS.

   THE COMPLETE UK G.U.I.D.E. TAPE TOGETHER WITH THESE MEMBERS,
   CAN NOW BE FOUND ON THE CBT OVERFLOW TAPE, WHICH WAS JUST
   ESTABLISHED.  THE UK G.U.I.D.E. TAPE FILE IS FILE 012 ON THAT
   TAPE.
