)F FUNCTION -
                 THE VSAMANAL COMMAND IS USED TO PROVIDE THE USER WITH
                 A  METHOD OF DETERMINING  HOW  MUCH  PHYSICAL SPACE A
                 DATASET WILL REQUIRE IT CAN ALSO BE USED TO DETERMINE
                 AN OPTIMUM DATA CI-SIZE, CI AND CA FREESPACE PERCENT-
                 AGES BASED ON FREE  RECORD VALUES, TRACK  UTILIZATION
                 PERCENTAGES,  AND OTHER  VSAM DATASET STATISTICS THAT
                 ARE HELPFUL WHEN DEFINING A NEW  DATASET OR ANALYSING
                 EXISTING DATASET DEFINITIONS.

                 THE DEVICES CURRENTLY SUPPORTED ARE 3350'S AND 3330'S

                 VSAMANAL IS A TSO COMMAND PROCESSOR FOR 3270 DISPLAYS
                 THE  ANALYZER  USES 3270 FIELD AND PF KEYS PROCESSING
                 AND CAN BE EXECUTED BY ENTERING "VSAMANAL".

))AVG-RECSIZE -  REQUIRED
                 THIS VALUE CAN BE ANY NUMBER FROM 1 TO 32761. FOR
                 FIXED LENGTH RECORDS THIS IS THE RECORD SIZE. FOR
                 VARIABLE-LENGTH RECORDS THIS IS THE AVERAGE RECORD-
                 SIZE VALUE USED IN ALL SPACE AND FREESPACE CAL-
                 CULATIONS. REMEMBER A TRUE AVERAGE RECORDSIZE
                 SHOULD BE BASED ON RECORD SIZE AND OCCURANCES OF
                 THOSE RECORD SIZES. AN INADEQUATE OR EXCESSIVE
                 VALUE WILL CAUSE CORRESPONDING SPACE AND FREE-
                 SPACE VALUES TO BE CALCULATED.

))MAX-RECSIZE -  REQUIRED
                 MAXIMUM RECORD SIZE FOR VARIABLE LENGTH RECORDS. THIS
                 VALUE CAN BE ANY NUMBER FROM 1 TO 32761 BUT CANNOT BE
                 LOWER THAN 'AVG-RECSIZE'. IT REPRESENTS THE LARGEST
                 RECORDSIZE YOUR DATASET WILL CONTAIN.

))RECORDS T/B LOADED - REQUIRED
                 NUMBER OF RECORDS TO BE LOADED INTO YOUR DATASET. THIS
                 VALUE CAN BE ANY NUMBER FROM 1 TO 9999999 AND IS USED
                 IN THE CALCULATION OF NON FREE SPACE FOR YOUR DATASET.

))RECORDS T/B ADDED - OPTIONAL
                 NUMBER OF RECORDS TO BE ADDED TO YOUR DATASET BETWEEN
                 REORGANIZATION. THIS VALUE CAN BE ANY NUMBER FROM 1 TO
                 9999999 AND IS USED TO CALCULATE FREESPACE FOR YOUR
                 DATASET.

                 FOR NON-KSDS DATASETS OR FOR KSDS DATSETS WITH NO CI
                 AND CA FREE RECORD PERCENTAGES SPECIFIED , THIS VALUE
                 WILL BE ADDED TO "RECORDS T/B LOADED" VALUE TO
                 DETERMINE SPACE ALLOCATION.

                 FOR KSDS DATASETS WITH A CI AND/OR CA FREE RECORD
                 PERCENTAGES SPECIFIED, THIS VALUE WILL BE USED TO
                 CALCUATE APPROPRIATE VSAM CI/CA FREESPACE PERCENTAGES
                 THAT WILL ACCOMODATE THE INDICATED NUMBER OF FREE
                 RECORDS.

))% ADD RECS CA FREESPACE - OPTIONAL
                 PERCENTAGE OF "RECORDS T/B ADDED" VALUE. THIS VALUE
                 CAN BE ANY NUMBER FROM 1 TO 100 AND REPRESENTS A NUMBER
                 OF RECORDS VALUE THAT WILL BE USED TO CALCULATE A
                 CORRESPONDING VSAM CA FREESPACE PERCENTAGE.

                 THIS PERCENTAGE IS ANALAGOUS TO THE VSAM CA FREESPACE
                 PERCENTAGE EXCEPT IT INDICATES A NUMBER OF FREE RECORDS
                 RATHER THAN A NUMBER OF FREE CONTROL INTERVALS. THE
                 VSAM CA FREESPACE PERCENTAGE THAT IS CALCULATED IS
                 BASED ON THE EVEN DISTRIBUTION OF THE FREE  RECORDS,
                 THROUGHOUT THE DATASET, IN FREE CONTROL INTERVALS
                 WITHIN A CONTROL AREA.

                 THIS VALUE AND THE CI PERCENTAGE VALUE CANNOT BE
                 COLLECTIVELY OVER 100. IF THEY ARE UNDER 100, THE
                 DIFFERENCE (ALSO A PERCENTAGE) IS CONVERTED TO A FREE
                 RECORD VALUE, AND A CORRESPONDING SPACE ALLOCATION WILL
                 BE ADDED TO THE SPACE ALLOCATION NEEDED FOR "RECORDS
                 T/B LOADED" AND ANY CI/CA FREESPACE REQUIREMENTS.

))% ADD RECS CI FREESPACE - OPTIONAL
                 PERCENTAGE OF "RECORDS T/B ADDED" VALUE. THIS VALUE CAN
                 BE ANY NUMBER FROM 1 TO 100 AND REPRESENTS A NUMBER OF
                 RECORDS VALUE THAT WILL BE USED TO CALCULATE A CORRES-
                 PONDING VSAM CI FREESPACE PERCENTAGE.

                 THIS PERCENTAGE IS ANALAGOUS TO THE VSAM CI FREESPACE,
                 EXCEPT IT INDICATES A NUMBER OF FREE RECORDS RATHER
                 THAN A NUMBER OF FREE BYTES. THE VSAM CI FREESPACE
                 PERCENTAGE THAT IS CALCULATED IS BASED ON THE EVEN
                 DISTRIBUTION OF THE FREE RECORDS, THROUGHOUT THE
                 DATASET, IN THOSE CONTROL INTERVALS NOT AFFECTED BY THE
                 CA FREESPACE PERCENTAGE

                 THIS VALUE AND THE CA PERCENTAGE VALUE CANNOT BE
                 COLLECTIVELY OVER 100. IF THEY ARE UNDER 100, THE DIF-
                 FERENCE (ALSO A PERCENTAGE) IS CONVERTED TO A FREE
                 RECORD VALUE AND A CORRESPONDING SPACE ALLOCATION WHICH
                 WILL BE ADDED TO THE SPACE ALLOCATION NEEDED FOR
                 "RECORDS T/B LOADED" AND ANY CI/CA FREESPACE REQUIRE-
                 MENTS.

))DEVICE TYPE -  REQUIRED

))DATA CI-SIZE SELECTION AND DISPLAY
                 WHEN ALL INPUT PARAMETERS HAVE BEEN ENTERED CORRECTLY
                 A DATA CI-SIZE SELECTION SCREEN WILL BE DISPLAYED IN
                 THE LOWER HALF OF THE TUBE. ALL AVAILABLE DATA CI-
                 SIZES WILL BE DISPLAYED.
                 THE SCREEN IS PAGEABLE BY USING PF KEYS 7 & 8 FOR
                 BACKWORD AND FORWARD DISPLAYS OF ALL DATA CI-SIZES.
                 USING THE DATA CI-SIZE SELECTION CHART YOU CAN SELECT
                 ONE OR MORE CI-SIZES FROM THIS SCREEN. WHEN THE DATA
                 CI-SIZE(S) HAVE BEEN SELECTED AND "ENTER" IS PRESSED,
                 A DETAIL DISPLAY SCREEN FOR EACH CI-SIZE SELECTED

                 AND FORWARD DISPLAYS OF EACH DETAIL CI-SIZE SCREEN.

                 THE DETAIL DISPLAY SCREEN GIVES YOU STATISTICS ABOUT
                 YOUR VSAM DATASET BASED ON A DATA CI-SIZE SELECTED.
                 THE FOLLOWING LIST IS AN EXPLANATION BY DISPLAY KEY-

                 BE TOO HIGH FOR THOSE DATASETS WITH FREE SPACE
                 BECAUSE OF CI/CA SPLITTING. IT MAY ALSO VARY FOR
                 VARIABLE LENGTH RECORDS IF THE "AVG-RECSIZE" IS NOT A
                 TRUE AVERAGE.

                 TOTAL-RECS-LOAD

))FREESPACE STATISTICS

                 CA %

                 "AVG-RECSIZE".

))WARNING
                 ********** WARNING **********

                 ALL FREE RECORD VALUES ARE IDEAL NUMBERS AND IN MOST
                 CASES WILL ALWAYS BE HIGH. THIS IS DUE TO CI AND
                 CA SPLITTING THAT CAN OCCUR WHILE INSERTING RECORDS.
                 THEREFORE, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE "RECORDS T/B
                 ADDED" VALUE BE LARGE ENOUGH TO ACCOMODATE LOST
                 SPACE THROUGH CI-CA SPLITS.
