 $$README  Text        This file you are reading now.

 CBT$XREF  Text        First attempt at creating a CBT tape cross
                       reference utility.  This version creates
                       MVS/Quickref user database entries.  As it
                       is today, it isn't all that useful yet.

 COPYANSI  Text        Rexx exec that filters an input file that has
                       ANSI printer control charactes and translates
                       them for PCs (except top of page).

 CLIPBRD   PDS Unload  This is a small ISPF application that can be
                       used to paste data that is wider and higher
                       than the ISPF edit screen.

 DIVER     PDS Unload  A very useless but fun ISPF application of an
                       animated stick figure known as MR. ASCII diving
                       into a pool.

 D2SEQN    Text        Death 2 Sequence Numbers - a filter that
                       removes sequence numbers when copying records.
                       This makes printouts of source code easier to
                       read. I use this when I printout JES2 source
                       code for example.  PTF strings like "@THX1138"
                       when found as the last word on a line are also
                       removed.  I find this really enhances my
                       source code viewing pleasure.

 DASRC     PDS Unload  A collection of mostly batch utility that I have
                       written over the years. Recommend putting in a
                       dataset with name "ibmuser.DA.SOURCE".

 DASRCV    XMIT        Additions to the DASRC file in LRECL > 80
                       RECFM=VB. Recommend putting in a
                       dataset with name "ibmuser.DA.SOURCEV".

 HLASMTR   Text        High Level Assembler Listing trimmer.  Good
                       for when you are downloading a listing for
                       printing on a PC printer.  The title lines and
                       trailing report stuff (like xref) are trimmed
                       out.

 IMGCOPY   Text        REXX exec that copies all bytes from the SYSUT1
                       file to SYSUT2 when the concept of records is
                       not relevant.  Good for copying .GIF and .ZIP
                       files around on a mainframe.

 IMGINFO   Text        REXX exec that shows the size of GIF and JPG
                       files in a format suitable for web pages.

 ISPFVAR   Text        REXX exec that shows all of the IBM supplied
                       ISPF variables (all/most vars up to ISPF 3.5)

 ISPF34L   Text        REXX exec that creates utility cards, job
                       streams from data set lists from ISPF 3.4. It
                       does not handle the whole volume listing very
                       well (as I just found out today).  It works best
                       on listings from a given HLQ.

 ISGECMOM  PDS Unload  An (slight) enhancement to IBM's sample ISGECMON

 JES2EXIT  PDS Unload  Edited versions of my JES2 exits

 MPFEXIT   PDS Unload  The MPF exits I use at my shop

 MVSVAR    Text        REXX exec that shows all of the IBM supplied
                       MVSVAR() function variables (TSO/E 2.5 or higher)

 NEWISPF   Text        Rexx exec that makes Version 4 of ISPF look
                       and act more like older versions.

 PROGXX    PDS Unload  ISPF edit macro that verifies the APF entries in
                       the SYS1.PARMLIB PROGxx member.

 SASGIF1   Text        Sample jobstream that creates a .GIF file using
                       SAS.

 SASGIF2   Text        Sample jobstream that creates a .GIF file (with
                       a transparent background) using SAS.

 SMFEXIT   PDS Unload  Edited versions of my SMF exits

 SMPEPP    PDS Unload  REXX exec that processes your SMP/E APPLY
                       CHECK output for PTFs bypassed due to ACTION,
                       HOLD, DOC, etc.  A list is presented that makes
                       viewing of the HOLD Text an easy task.

 SHOWMRO   Text        Assembler program that shows the currently active
                       CICS MRO regions via TSO TPUTs.

 SHOWSYM   PDS Unload  ISPF edit macro that shows the system sumbols on
                       you MVS version 5 or higher

 SPELLCHK  PDS Unload  ISPF edit macro that performs a spell check on
                       selected lines or the whole edit file.  SAS is
                       needed.

 SYSVAR    Text        REXX exec that shows all of the IBM supplied
                       SYSVAR() function variables

 TOD       PDS Unload  This package adds two features to pre-OS/390
                       JES2 to simulate the time of day functions
                       in the JES2 JOB log.

 VSMAP     Text        REXX exec that shows the Virtual Storage map.
                       The subroutine is good for inclusion in other
                       execs.

 XMITINFO  Text        REXX exec that shows some internal information
                       about a TSO XMIT file.  This exec is more useful
                       on a PC when trying to determine if a file is
                       actually a TSO XMIT file.  This is the first
                       phase of a project to create a PC program to
                       extract files and PDS members from a TSO XMIT
                       file.  XMITINFO does work on TSO.

 Y2K       Text        REXX exec that shows the number of days left
                       until the Year 2000.
