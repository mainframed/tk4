 I've received the most complements about:

 - DA$PDSR - A PDS reporter utility found in member DASRC

 - SMPEPP  - A REXX exec that makes it easy to browse the HOLD text
             data to make your APPLY CHECKs verifications go faster.

 Types of files in member $INDEX

 - PDS Unload...Contains input to utilities IEBUPDTE (IBM) or
                PDSLOAD (CBT tape).  I recommend using PDSLOAD for the
                ISPF stats.

                See sample job $PDSLOAD for doing this via PDSLOAD

 - Text.........Just plain text

 - TSO xmit.....This member is in TSO TRANSMIT format so that the
                variable blocked source could be transferred in a
                LRECL=80 file.  You will need to copy this dataset to a
                LRECL=80 BLKSIZE=80 RECFM=F file and then use this
                command to retrieve the members:

                   RECEIVE INDATASET(copy.of.member)
