 This is a partial list of some of the things in this collection.


     ABENDWTO  -  Somewhat shop-dependent code which shows how
                  to scan for abends and return codes from
                  previous steps in the same job.  Then, if
                  there is a bad return code or abend, save all
                  the temporary files.

     ABINDEX   -  Shop-dependent.  Shows how to create hiperspace
                  etc.

     CATEDIT   -  Update an ICF Catalog in-place using QSAM
                  PUTX.  Purpose is to convert all files
                  cataloged to 3480's or 3490's into 3490e's.
                  (Interesting code.  Has to be authorized nowadays.)

     DYNADSN   -  Dynamically alters dsnames in succeeding
                  steps of a job.

     DYNATEST  -  JCL to test DYNADSN.

     FINDEXEC  -  EXEC to find where an EXEC is.

     FINDLLIB  -  EXEC to find an ISPLLIB member.

     FINDLOAD  -  EXEC to find a load module in the link list.

     FINDMLIB  -  EXEC to find an ISPF message member.

     FINDPLIB  -  Exec to find an ISPF panel.

     FINDSLIB  -  Exec to find an ISPF skeleton.

     FINDTLIB  -  Exec to find an ISPF table.

     FREEALL   -  TSO Free All command

     GRSUSER   -  TSO Command that can be used from an ISPF
                  3.4 list to determine who has the file.

     IGDACSMC  -  SMS ACS management class exit that can
                  dynamically change ACS variables.

     LINKLIST  -  Lists libraries in the link list.

     SLEEPSRC  -  SLEEP command from REXX.

     TIMEOUT   -  TSO/E Command to dynamically set TIME=1440

                  catalog access code in this member.  Direct
                  SVC 26 calls.

     XLIBALLD  -  TSO doesn't support SUBSYS= accesses that JCL
                  supports.  This allows these allocations in TSO.
                  Used for allocation LIBRARIAN datasets on TSO.

     XLIBALLS  -

     XLIBMEML  -  "Member Exists" REXX function.

     XLIBMEMX  -  "Member Exists" REXX function.
