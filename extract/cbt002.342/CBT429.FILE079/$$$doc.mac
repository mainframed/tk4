                 INDEX TO MEMBERS OF THIS COLLECTION

       This collection of tools comprises:

       DCF Script/VS ISPF Interface, as follows:

       1)  A complete production ISPF dialog interface to
           IBM's DCF Script/VS facility.

           To install this interface, you need members:
           PLIB1, MSGS, CLIST1 to be IEBUPDTE-loaded to
           a panel library, a message library, and a
           CLIST library, respectively.  Also, you will
           need assembled, member IKJCT44B from the SOURCE
           member in this pds.  This source must be assembled,
           linkedited, and placed in a (linklist) library
           that is accessible to your TSO session.

           This production interface is not CUA compliant
           as it is.

       2)  A prototype modification to the above DCF Script/VS
           interface, to make it CUA compliant.  This consists
           of panels and CLISTS to substitute for like-named
           members in the panel and CLIST libraries created
           by the above installation.

           Part of this prototype addition consists of an
           ISPF primary option menu containing a calendar
           and action bar pull-downs.

           To install this interface, you need members:
           PLIB2, CLIST2 to be IEBUPDTE-loaded into panel
           and CLIST libraries that will be concatenated ahead
           of the respective libraries created by the install
           process in item 1) above.

       In addition to the DCF Script/VS ISPF interface, this
       file contains the following other members:

        SOURCE    -  A collection of various exits to JES2
                     relating to TSO.  There is also a TSO
                     session manager exit, and a GDDM plotter
                     exit.  This member is in IEBUPDTE unloaded
                     format and must be IEBUPDTE-loaded into a
                     partitioned dataset.

                     Included in this member is a CLIST variable
                     extension exit (IKJCT44B) that is required
                     by member PLIB1.  This member adds some
                     built-in functions to the CLIST language
                     and is required for the DCF Script/VS
                     interface.

        USERMODS  -  A collection of assorted MVS and JES2
                     local mods packaged in SMP format.  The
                     usefulness of this collection lies in
                     the fact that they are sample mods to
                     IBM products, which IBM never provided
                     samples for.

        DOCLIB    -  This is a 30-page document describing
                     the DCF Script/VS Dialog frontend, and
                     its history.  This was a presentation
                     given at SHARE 80 in San Francisco.

        DEFMACRO  -  A collection of SCRIPT macros for virtually
                     every font family marketed by IBM.  This
                     collection allows easy use of many fonts
                     by a SCRIPT user.

        PUBTOOLS  -  The complete Charles Schwab in-house
                     standards guide for mainframe-based desktop
                     publishing, in SCRIPT format.  (This takes
                     time to format and print on an IBM printer--
                     about 40 minutes on a 3820.)
