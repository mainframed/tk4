:p.The list describes the destination ids which should be used to route
output to various printer locations within headquarters.  It is valid
for all printers controlled by either JES or PSF.  When no DEST JCL
parameter is specified for SYSOUT, it will be routed to the Mailroom on
the 10th floor of 101 Montgomery.  The Mailroom will be LOCAL or the
default, so no additional DEST has been assigned for these printers.

3816 or ISI model 7028 or 7817 printers.  Additional printers may be
added using the naming convention as described here.  If a new printer
appears on your floor, try specifying "DEST=nnnnffx" to route sysout to
it.  Each printer should have a note with the destination id.

:h2.Forms Definitions
:p.The AFP resource which describes the physical
characteristics of printed output is called a forms definition.  It is
invoked for a specific output dataset through JCL
or the default forms definition for a specific printer will be used.
It includes:
:ol.
:li.Horizontal and vertical offset for the page
:li.Presentation of the page landscape or portrait
:li.Cut-sheet printer specifics
:sl.
:li.Bin selection
:li.Simplex/duplex/tumble duplex selection
:esl.
:li.Optical Overlay or forms flash
:li.Electronic Overlays
:li.Field which will be suppressed from printing
:eol.
:p.This section lists the form definitions available at Charles Schwab
& Co., Inc. for various printer types.  They are broken into three
categories.  The first category is the IBM-supplied forms definitions.
The second category is the Schwab in-house generic forms definitions.
The naming conventions and a list of generic forms definitions are
described in this section.  The third category is the special form
definitions.  The name will be tied closely with the application and
form identification, unless a generic form definition can be used.
:h3.IBM-Supplied FORMDEFs
:p.Complete details and a current list can be found in either IBM's
Print Management Facility User's Guide and Reference #SH35-0059 or Print
Services Facility/MVS Application Programming Guide #S544-3084.
:h3.In-house Generic FORMDEFs
:p.The following is the generic naming conventions
for AFP printers at Schwab:
:sl.
.kp on
:li.F1hhvvod
:li.where
:sl.
:li.F1 is the prefix provided by PPFA or PMF
:li.hh is horizontal offset
:sl compact.
:li.00 = 0"
:li.17 = .17" or 1/6"
:li.25 = .25" or 1/4"
:li.33 = .33" or 1/3"
:li.50 = .50" or 1/2"
:li.A0 = 1"
:li.F0 = 1.5"
:li.Note:  The alpha characters would represent standard hex values.
This will allow hh to have 3 logical positions, the 1st two are decimal
and the highest level inches.  For example hex 'A' =10, in our case
1.00 would represent 1 inch.  Therefore 1.1 inches would be hex 'B0',
and 1.17 inches would be hex 'B7'.  We can then represent up to 3.59
inches with hex 'Z9'.
:esl.
:li.vv is vertical offset
:sl compact.
:li.00 = 0"
:li.17 = .17" or 1/6"
:li.25 = .25" or 1/4"
:li.33 = .33" or 1/3"
:li.50 = .50" or 1/2"
:li.A0 = 1"
:li.F0 = 1.5"
:li.etc
:esl.
:li.o is overlay
:sl compact.
:li.Y = yes (usually graybar in generic Formdefs)
:li.N = no
:esl.
:li.d is the plex mode selected
:sl compact.
:li.S = simplex
:li.D = duplex  (not available on continuous-form printers)
:li.T = tumble  (not available on continuous-form printers)

:p.This table lists the Form definitions for all printer types.
The Siemens' 2300s on the 10th floor of 101 Montgomery
and the Siemens' 2140s in Brisbane are continuous printers and cannot
handle duplex printing.  The 3820/3816 printers are cut-sheet which
handle duplex printing.

:tcap.Schwab Local FORMDEFs for all printer types.
:etable.
:p.*  The majority of PAGEDEFs expect to use these FORMDEFs.  The others
are generally available for older applications to compensate for
operator adjustments and should be avoided if possible.
:h3.Special FORMDEFs
:p.When the generic form definitions cannot be used, an application will
have a special form definition. The most common reason for a special
form definition will be because an optical overlay or an electronic
overlay is required.  In this case the
name will be tied closely with the application and form identification.
See "ISDPUB.SYSTEM.ID' for a list of application identifiers.
For example, production
job "PRDPANSP" uses a SYSOUT=(1,,120)...with an electronic overlay
named O1DP120 will use a form definition named F1DP120.
:p.The following is the special application naming conventions
for AFP printers at Schwab:
.kp on
:sl.
:li.F1aaffff
:li.where
:sl.
:li.F1 is the prefix provided by PPFA or PMF
:li.aa is application identifier - see 'ISDPUB.SYSTEM.ID'
:li.ffff is the electronic or flash form identifications

:h2.Electronic Forms
:p.The AFP resource which predefines a set of constant data to be
merged with variable data at print time is called an electronic form
or electronic overlay.  The electronic overlay is typically called
from a FORMDEF.
:p.An electronic form could replace either an optical overlay or
a pre-printed form.  All optical overlays at Schwab have been converted
to electronic overlays.  The benefit is no operator intervention
is required to mount an optical overlay or load a new form.  This
means users recevie output sooner than the previous method.

:p.Note that the page definitions are somewhat printer specific.  This
is due to printer specific attributes.  The continuous form printers,
such as the Siemens' 2300 and 2140 (which look like an IBM 3800)
type printers have an origin in the top
left corner.  The other AFP printers in house are cut-sheet and the
default forms are different orientations from the continuous printers.
Therefore the page definitions are listed
by printer type and valid formids.
:p.This table lists the Page definitions for all printer types,
which include the Siemens' 2300s on the 10th floor of 101 Montgomery
and the Siemens' 2140s in Brisbane.  The form size and page size are

:h3.Special PAGEDEFs
:p.When the generic page definitions cannot be used, an application will
have a special page definition.  The name will be tied closely with the
application.  See "ISDPUB.SYSTEM.ID' for a list of application
identifiers.  The name will refer to the job name and OUTPUT statement
number in the job.  For example, production job "PRCCDSP3" has a
SYSOUT=(4,,CUSF) using OUTPUT card OUT2 in the PROC.  It will use a page
definition named P1CCDSP2.  When a duplicate RMDS sysout statement
exists, it would use the original page definition in this case P1CCDSP2.
:p.The following is the naming convention for AFP printers at Schwab:
.kp on
:sl.
:li.P1aajjjn
:li.where
:sl.
:li.P1 is the prefix provided by PPFA or PMF
:li.aa is the application identifier - see 'ISDPUB.SYSTEM.ID'
:li.jjj is the job identifier
:li.n is the sysout number within the job.

:h1.Summary of Mainframe Printing Methods at Schwab
:h2.Overview
:p.
There are three primary printing methods from the host system at
Charles Schwab & Co., INC.  Printers are
either defined as Advanced Function Printers or CICS transaction
printers or VTAM print services printers.  A description of each follows
this section.
:h3.Advanced Function Printing
:p.
Advanced Function Printing is IBM's suggested printing platform
supporting from the desktop to high-speed production
printers, fan-fold and cut-sheet form capabilities.
It is an architecture which is SAA compliant. The software product line
handles grahics, images, signatures, logos, proportional fonts,
electronic forms, and text.
:p.
Schwab has selected this as a standard for mainframe printing.
High volume print
requirements for in-house reports printed on the 10th floor of 101
Montgomery and customer statements/correspondence printed in Brisbane
will use AFP functionality.  Currently many in-house documents printed
on the 3820/3816 type printers use DCF/SCRIPT which is part of the
AFP product line.
:p.
A part of AFP printing allows for the off-loading of some documents to
other printers in PostScript format on PC-attached or LAN attached
printers.  This is not formally supported within Schwab at this date.
:h3.CICS Attached Printers
This is the historical method of printing transactions, wires, etc at
the branches within Schwab.  The original driver is an in-house grown
CICS transaction called "MESS".
:h3.VTAM Print Services
:p.VPS is a product of Levi, Ray and Shoup, INC.  It allows definition
of any printer which can connect to a 3270 controller cluster to the
mainframe.  It interfaces with JES to package and pass printed output
through VTAM.  This is a method to connect pc-attached printers,
branch printers, etc.
:h1.Advanced Function Printing
:h2.JCL
.kp on
:p.Previous to AFP many jobs called FCBs, Character sets, and/or
optical forms,
to define how a particular job would print.  The format might be:
:sl.
:li.//PRINT DD SYSOUT=(A,,0179),
:li.//        FCB=8STD,
:li.//        CHARS=(GT10,GT12,GT15,GB10),
:li.//        FLASH=FORM,
:li.//        DCB=(LRECL=133,RECFM=FBA,BLKSIZE=3120,OPTCD=J)
:esl.
.kp off
.kp on
:p.Many  resources are incorporated into two AFP resources.
The first is the FORMDEF and the second is the PAGEDEF (see the next
section for further description). The JCL should look like:
:sl compact.
:li.//OUT1 OUTPUT  CLASS=c,
:li.//             CHARS=(chr1,chr2,chr3,chr4),
:li.//             DEST=dest,
:li.//             FORM=form,
:li.//             FORMDEF=fdef,
:li.//             PAGEDEF=pdef,
:li.//             PIMSG=YES,
:li.//             TRC=YES,
:li.//             USERLIB=(user.lib)
:li.//PRINT DD SYSOUT=(c,,form),
:li.//             OUTPUT=*.OUT1
:li.
.kp off
.kp on
:li.For example:
:li.//OUT1 OUTPUT  CLASS=4,
:li.//             CHARS=(GT10,GT12,GT15,GB10),
:li.//             DEST=BRISBANE,
:li.//             FORM=179,
:li.//             FORMDEF=0050NS,
:li.//             PAGEDEF=LP81MN,
:li.//             PIMSG=YES,
:li.//             TRC=YES
:li.//PRINT DD SYSOUT=(4,,179),
:li.//             OUTPUT=*.OUT1
.kp off
:esl.
:h3.Optional JCL Parms
:sl.
:li.CHARS=
:sl.
:li.Specify up to 4 font names of 1 to 4 alphmeric characters. The
fonts must reside in a library assigned to the printer or defined by
the User library.  This is not necessary if fonts are specified in
the PAGEDEF.
:esl.
:li.TRC=
:sl.
:li.Used only when more than 1 font is to be used and column 2 of the
line data includes a table reference character.
:esl.
:li.USERLIB=
:sl.
:li.Used to specify a private library which contains resources for
printing.
:esl.
:esl.
:h3. Hints and Helps
:h4. CHARS
:P. Schwab has determined to leave CHARS external to the generic
PAGEDEFs for two reasons.  First, there was not a one for one
correlation of chars to FCB used.  So to reduce the number of pagedefs
required the chars parameter was left as it currently is specified in
the appropriate JCL.  Second, it allows for changing CHARS without
modifying the existing pagedef.
:p.The limitation with this method is that only the old style line mode
or compatibility mode fonts can be used for these pagedefs.  The
compatibility mode font names were four (4) characters (excluding the
prefix). The JCL CHARS parameter allows a maximum of 4 characters.
However the AFP font names are six (6) characters (excluding the
prefix).  So as we migrate to new fonts and formatting capabilities of
AFP, internal definition of fonts will be used. See "Script Information"
in this document for additional information on fonts.

:h2.New Printer Resources
:p.IBM-supplied and generic resources will be maintained by the
Printing Technology Group.  Special resources, such as forms definitions
and page definitions, are the responsibility of the user.  They can
be generated and tested in a user's private library through use of the
USERLIB statement in their JCL.  During testing the user must have the
print operator specify any job setup parameters required at the printer.
Once testing is complete the user must pass job setup information and
resource information to the Printing Technology Group.  The resource
will be placed in the appropriate library by the Printing Technology
Group.
:p.The Printer Technology Group is available on a consulting basis to
assist users with special resources.  A minimum of two weeks is required
to process requests.  A fee may be charged for services if a request
requires a resource to be acquired from an outside source.  A users
should complete TOSS form "PRTG:  Application Support Request" for
PAGEDEF or FORMDEF resources.  TOSS form "PRTG:  Resource Request"
should be completed for FONTS, signatures, logos, or electronic
overlays.  Completed forms should be sent via TOSS to Printer
Administrator.
:h4. A Note About Orientation
:p.New users to AFP are often confused about the terminology used to
describe page orientation.  The following diagram should assist.
:rdef id=orient
      cwidths='3i 3i'.
:table refid=orient.
:row.
:c.Landscape 0 degree (Direction across)
.si s1pagel0 inline
:c.Landscape 90 degree (Direction down)
.si s1pagel9 inline
:row.
:c.Portrait 0 degree (Direction across)
.si s1pagep0 inline
:c.Portrait 90 degree (Direction down)
.si s1pagep9 inline
:tcap.Page orientation samples for continuous form printers.
:etable.
:p.It is sometimes easier to set a printer for one generic form and
reorient various documents in different ways for different results.
This reduces operator intervention thus improving printout turnaround.
:h3.In-house Forms
:p.The FORM= and/or SYSOUT parameters should specify the physical form
id for the operator should mount at print time.  It should NOT include
the version number as part of the form or one of two things will happen.
Either all JCL will need to be changed each time the version number
changes or the JCL will all have different form numbers actually calling
the same physical form.  In the second case, operator intervention will
be required for each different form even though it is really the same
physical form.  For example previously JCL included:
:sl compact.
:li.SYSOUT=(4,,0179)
:li.SYSOUT=(4,,1792)
:li.SYSOUT=(4,,1793)
:li.SYSOUT=(4,,1794)
:li.
:li.These should change to:
:li.
:li.SYSOUT=(4,,179)
:esl.
.kp off
:p.Physically the operator mounted the same form, but intervention was
required since the system treated them as the different forms.  The
result to the user is turnaround time for printout is longer.
:p.Some examples of valid forms:
:sl.
:li.179     264     280     281     284
:li.CONS    DIVS
:esl.
:p.For information on valid Form numbers coordinate with Brisbane
Print operator supervisor.
.im scrfonts
:h3.FONTLIB Script Command / SCRPTFNT DD
:p.The FONTLIB script command defines the font library to be used when
formatting documents for AFP or Postscript printers.  The format is
as follows:
:sl.
:li.FONTLIB('SYS1.FONTLIB') ~This will define the IBM  fonts for 3800
:li.FONTLIB('SYS0.FONTLIB') ~This will define the custom fonts for 3800
:li.FONTLIB('SYS1.FONTLIBB') ~This will define the IBM fonts for 3820
:li.FONTLIB('SYS0.FONTLIBB')~This will define the custom fonts for 3820
:p.Note:  The 3800 type fonts are unbounded box fonts.  The 3820 and
other cut-sheet printers use bounded box fonts.  The actual characters
which are loaded into the printer are different, so they are stored
in different libraries.  Both sets of libraries should contain the same
font styles, so you can print on either printer type without changing
your application.  The section in this document, "Other Fonts",
has examples
of methods to define fonts generically for printing on either printer
type.
:esl.
:p.An alternative to using the FONTLIB Script command is to define a
SCRPTFNT DD statement.  This is useful when you need to access fonts
from multiple libraries.  The statement would look like:
.sp 1
.fo off
.bf gt12
~From Batch:  //SCRPTFNT DD DSN=SYS0.FONTLIB,DISP=SHR
~             //         DD DSN=SYS1.FONTLIB,DISP=SHR
.sp 1
~From TSO:   ALLOC F(SCRPTFNT) DA('SYS0.FONTLIBB' +
~                                 'SYS1.FONTLIBB') SHR REUS

& Co., Inc. for various printer types.  They are broken into three
categories.  The first category is the IBM-supplied forms definitions.
The second category is the Schwab in-house generic forms definitions.
The naming conventions and a list of generic forms definitions are
described in this section.  The third category is the special form
definitions.  The name will be tied closely with the application and
form identification, unless a generic form definition can be used.
:h3.IBM-Supplied FORMDEFs
:p.Complete details and a current list can be found in either IBM's
Print Management Facility User's Guide and Reference #SH35-0059 or Print
Services Facility/MVS Application Programming Guide #S544-3084.

:p.The following is the generic naming conventions
for AFP printers at Schwab:
:sl.
.kp on
:li.F1hhvvod
:li.where
:sl.
:li.F1 is the prefix provided by PPFA or PMF
:li.hh is horizontal offset
:sl compact.
:li.00 = 0"
:li.17 = .17" or 1/6"
:li.25 = .25" or 1/4"
:li.33 = .33" or 1/3"
:li.50 = .50" or 1/2"
:li.A0 = 1"
:li.F0 = 1.5"
:li.Note:  The alpha characters would represent standard hex values.
This will allow hh to have 3 logical positions, the 1st two are decimal
and the highest level inches.  For example hex 'A' =10, in our case
1.00 would represent 1 inch.  Therefore 1.1 inches would be hex 'B0',
and 1.17 inches would be hex 'B7'.  We can then represent up to 3.59
inches with hex 'Z9'.

:tcap.Schwab Local FORMDEFs for all printer types.
:etable.
:p.*  The majority of PAGEDEFs expect to use these FORMDEFs.  The others
 are generally available for older applications to compensate for
 operator adjustments and should be avoided if possible.
:h3.Special FORMDEFs
:p.When the generic form definitions cannot be used, an application will
have a special form definition. The most common reason for a special
form definition will be because an optical overlay or an electronic
overlay is required.  In this case the
name will be tied closely with the application and form identification.
See "ISDPUB.SYSTEM.ID' for a list of application identifiers.
For example, production
job "PRDPANSP" uses a SYSOUT=(1,,120)...with an electronic overlay
named O1DP120 will use a form definition named F1DP120.
:p.The following is the special application naming conventions
for AFP printers at Schwab:
.kp on
:sl.
:li.F1aaffff
:li.where
:sl.
:li.F1 is the prefix provided by PPFA or PMF
:li.aa is application identifier - see 'ISDPUB.SYSTEM.ID'
:li.ffff is the electronic or flash form identifications

:h2.Page Definitions
:p.The AFP resource which formats line data and prepares pages
for printed output is called a page definition.  It replaces the
old FCB plus added features.  It is
invoked for a specific output dataset through JCL
or the default page definition for a specific printer will be used.
It includes:
:ol.
:li.Logical page size
:li.Direction for printing
:li.Carriage control positioning
:li.Lines per inch
:li.Print position for specific input data fields
:li.Constant data position and definition
:li.Font list - (Schwab keeps fonts outside of generic pagedefs)
:li.Page segments list
:li.Conditional processing
:li.Fields which will be suppressed from printing
:eol.
:p.This section lists the page definitions available at Charles Schwab

:p.Note that the page definitions are somewhat printer specific.  This
is due to printer specific attributes.  The continuous form printers,
such as the Siemens' 2300 and 2140 (which look like an IBM 3800)
type printers have an origin in the top
left corner.  The other AFP printers in house are cut-sheet and the
default forms are different orientations from the continuous printers.
Therefore the page definitions are listed
by printer type and valid formids.

which include the Siemens' 2300s on the 10th floor of 101 Montgomery
and the Siemens' 2140s in Brisbane.  The form size and page size are

:p.When the generic page definitions cannot be used, an application will
have a special page definition. There are many reasons for a special
page definition. See the handbook "Publishing Tools and Accessories",
available in the Technical Services Library, for a discussion of reasons
for special page definitions.  In any  case the name will be tied
closely with the application.  See "ISDPUB.SYSTEM.ID' for a list of
application identifiers.  The name will refer to the job name and OUTPUT
statement number in the job.  For example, production job "PRCCDSP3" has
a SYSOUT=(4,,CUSF) using OUTPUT card OUT2 in the PROC.  It will use a
page definition named P1CCDSP2.  When a duplicate RMDS sysout statement
exists, it would use the original page definition in this case P1CCDSP2.

:h2.New Printer Resources
:p.IBM-supplied and generic resources will be maintained by the
Printing Technology Group.  Special resources, such as forms definitions
and page definitions, are the responsibility of the user.  They can
be generated and tested in a user's private library through use of the
USERLIB statement in their JCL.  During testing the user must have the
print operator specify any job setup parameters required at the printer.
Once testing is complete the user must pass job setup information and
resource information to the Printing Technology Group.  The resource
will be placed in the appropriate library by the Printing Technology
Group.

:h1.Summary of Mainframe Printing Methods at Schwab
:h2.Overview
:p.
There are three primary printing methods from the host system at
Charles Schwab & Co., INC.  Printers are
either defined as Advanced Function Printers or CICS transaction
printers or VTAM print services printers.  A description of each follows
this section.
:h3.Advanced Function Printing
:p.
Advanced Function Printing is IBM's suggested printing platform
supporting from the desktop to high-speed production
printers, fan-fold and cut-sheet form capabilities.
It is an architecture which is SAA compliant. The software product line
handles grahics, images, signatures, logos, proportional fonts,
electronic forms, and text.
:p.
Schwab has selected this as a standard for mainframe printing.
High volume print
requirements for in-house reports printed on the 10th floor of 101
Montgomery and customer statements/correspondence printed in Brisbane
will use AFP functionality.  Currently many in-house documents printed
on the 3820/3816 type printers use DCF/SCRIPT which is part of the
AFP product line.
:p.
A part of AFP printing allows for the off-loading of some documents to
other printers in PostScript format on PC-attached or LAN attached
printers.  This is not formally supported within Schwab at this date.
:h3.CICS Attached Printers
This is the historical method of printing transactions, wires, etc at
the branches within Schwab.  The original driver is an in-house grown
CICS transaction called "MESS".
:h3.VTAM Print Services
:p.VPS is a product of Levi, Ray and Shoup, INC.  It allows definition
of any printer which can connect to a 3270 controller cluster to the
mainframe.  It interfaces with JES to package and pass printed output
through VTAM.  This is a method to connect pc-attached printers,
branch printers, etc.
:h1.Advanced Function Printing
:h2.JCL
.kp on
:p.Previous to AFP many jobs called FCBs, Character sets, and/or
optical forms,
to define how a particular job would print.  The format might be:
:sl.
:li.//PRINT DD SYSOUT=(A,,0179),
:li.//        FCB=8STD,
:li.//        CHARS=(GT10,GT12,GT15,GB10),
:li.//        FLASH=FORM,
:li.//        DCB=(LRECL=133,RECFM=FBA,BLKSIZE=3120,OPTCD=J)
:esl.
.kp off
.kp on
:p.Many  resources are incorporated into two AFP resources.
The first is the FORMDEF and the second is the PAGEDEF (see the next
section for further description). The JCL should look like:
:sl compact.
:li.//OUT1 OUTPUT  CLASS=c,
:li.//             CHARS=(chr1,chr2,chr3,chr4),
:li.//             DEST=dest,
:li.//             FORM=form,
:li.//             FORMDEF=fdef,
:li.//             PAGEDEF=pdef,
:li.//             PIMSG=YES,
:li.//             TRC=YES,
:li.//             USERLIB=(user.lib)
:li.//PRINT DD SYSOUT=(c,,form),
:li.//             OUTPUT=*.OUT1
:li.

:li.For example:

:h3. Hints and Helps
:h4. CHARS
:P. Schwab has determined to leave CHARS external to the generic
PAGEDEFs for two reasons.  First, there was not a one for one
correlation of chars to FCB used.  So to reduce the number of pagedefs
required the chars parameter was left as it currently is specified in
the appropriate JCL.  Second, it allows for changing CHARS without
modifying the existing pagedef.
:p.The limitation with this method is that only the old style line mode
or compatibility mode fonts can be used for these pagedefs.  The
compatibility mode font names were four (4) characters (excluding the
prefix). The JCL CHARS parameter allows a maximum of 4 characters.
However the AFP font names are six (6) characters (excluding the
prefix).  So as we migrate to new fonts and formatting capabilities of
AFP, internal definition of fonts will be used. See "Script Information"
in this document for additional information on fonts.

:h2.Page Definitions
:p.The AFP resource which formats line data and prepares pages
for printed output is called a page definition.  It replaces the
old FCB plus added features.  It is
invoked for a specific output dataset through JCL
or the default page definition for a specific printer will be used.
It includes:
:ol.
:li.Logical page size
:li.Direction for printing
:li.Carriage control positioning
:li.Lines per inch
:li.Print position for specific input data fields
:li.Constant data position and definition
:li.Font list - (Schwab keeps fonts outside of generic pagedefs)
:li.Page segments list
:li.Conditional processing
:li.Fields which will be suppressed from printing
:eol.
:p.This section lists the page definitions available at Charles Schwab
& Co., Inc. for various printer types.  They are broken into three
categories.  The first category is the IBM-supplied page definitions.
The naming conventions and a list of generic page definitions are
described in this section.  The third category is the Special page
definitions.  The name will be tied closely with the application and
form identification, unless a generic form definition can be used.
:h3.IBM-Supplied PAGEDEFs

:p.Note that the page definitions are somewhat printer specific.  This
is due to printer specific attributes.  The continuous form printers,
such as the Siemens' 2300 and 2140 (which look like an IBM 3800)
type printers have an origin in the top
left corner.  The other AFP printers in house are cut-sheet and the
default forms are different orientations from the continuous printers.
Therefore the page definitions are listed
by printer type and valid formids.
:p.This table lists the Page definitions for all printer types,
which include the Siemens' 2300s on the 10th floor of 101 Montgomery
and the Siemens' 2140s in Brisbane.  The form size and page size are
in inches.

:h3.Special PAGEDEFs
:p.When the generic page definitions cannot be used, an application will
have a special page definition. There are many reasons for a special
page definition. See the handbook "Publishing Tools and Accessories",
available in the Technical Services Library, for a discussion of reasons
for special page definitions.  In any  case the name will be tied
closely with the application.  See "ISDPUB.SYSTEM.ID' for a list of
application identifiers.  The name will refer to the job name and OUTPUT
statement number in the job.  For example, production job "PRCCDSP3" has
a SYSOUT=(4,,CUSF) using OUTPUT card OUT2 in the PROC.  It will use a
page definition named P1CCDSP2.  When a duplicate RMDS sysout statement
exists, it would use the original page definition in this case P1CCDSP2.
:p.The following is the naming convention for AFP printers at Schwab:
.kp on
:sl.
:li.P1aajjjn
:li.where
:sl.
:li.P1 is the prefix provided by PPFA or PMF
:li.aa is the application identifier - see 'ISDPUB.SYSTEM.ID'
:li.jjj is the job identifier
:li.n is the sysout number within the job.
:esl.

:h2.New Printer Resources
:p.IBM-supplied and generic resources will be maintained by the
Printing Technology Group.  Special resources, such as forms definitions
and page definitions, are the responsibility of the user.  They can
be generated and tested in a user's private library through use of the
USERLIB statement in their JCL.  During testing the user must have the
print operator specify any job setup parameters required at the printer.
Once testing is complete the user must pass job setup information and
resource information to the Printing Technology Group.  The resource
will be placed in the appropriate library by the Printing Technology
Group.
:h4. A Note About Orientation
:p.New users to AFP are often confused about the terminology used to
describe page orientation.  The following diagram should assist.
:rdef id=orient
      cwidths='3i 3i'.
:table refid=orient.

:tcap.Page orientation samples for continuous form printers.
:etable.
:p.It is sometimes easier to set a printer for one generic form and
reorient various documents in different ways for different results.
This reduces operator intervention thus improving printout turnaround.
:h3.In-house Forms
:p.The FORM= and/or SYSOUT parameters should specify the physical form
id for the operator should mount at print time.  It should NOT include
the version number as part of the form or one of two things will happen.
Either all JCL will need to be changed each time the version number
changes or the JCL will all have different form numbers actually calling
the same physical form.  In the second case, operator intervention will
be required for each different form even though it is really the same
physical form.  For example previously JCL included:
:sl compact.
:li.SYSOUT=(4,,0179)
:li.SYSOUT=(4,,1792)
:li.SYSOUT=(4,,1793)
:li.SYSOUT=(4,,1794)
:li.
:li.These should change to:
:li.
:li.SYSOUT=(4,,179)
:esl.
.kp off
Physically the operator mounted the same form, but intervention was
required since the system treated them as the different forms.  The
result to the user is turnaround time for printout is longer.
:p.Some examples of valid forms:
:sl.

:h3.FONTLIB Script Command / SCRPTFNT DD
:p.The FONTLIB script command defines the font library to be used when
formatting documents for AFP or Postscript printers.  The format is
as follows:
:sl.
:li.FONTLIB('SYS1.FONTLIB') ~This will define the IBM  fonts for 3800
:li.FONTLIB('SYS0.FONTLIB') ~This will define the custom fonts for 3800
:li.FONTLIB('SYS1.FONTLIBB') ~This will define the IBM fonts for 3820
:li.FONTLIB('SYS0.FONTLIBB')~This will define the custom fonts for 3820
:p.Note:  The 3800 type fonts are unbounded box fonts.  The 3820 and
other cut-sheet printers use bounded box fonts.  The actual characters
which are loaded into the printer are different, so they are stored
in different libraries.  Both sets of libraries should contain the same
font styles, so you can print on either printer type without changing
your application.  The section in this document, "Other Fonts",
has examples
of methods to define fonts generically for printing on either printer
type.
:esl.
:p.An alternative to using the FONTLIB Script command is to define a
SCRPTFNT DD statement.  This is useful when you need to access fonts
from multiple libraries.  The statement would look like:
.sp 1

:p.VPS is a method to print to VTAM attached printers.  Part of VPS
functionality, allows for users to obtain multiple printing formats.
This is done by VPS with "exits" which include various printer controls
with the user print job.  Some examples include the capability to change
fonts, change from portrait to landscape, change from simplex printing
to duplex printing, and more.  The flexibility a user has to format
output is determined by the type of printer being accessed.

:h2.Script Information
:h3.Some Basic information about FONTS
:p.
In order to use the different fonts in Script, there are
some Script control words you will need to be familiar with.
These control words can be used in other ways than
described in this document, however if used as shown, the
results will be correct.
:dl tsize=7
:dt..df
:dd.This is the Define Font control word. This control word
is used to give Script details about the font.
:hp3.You only need to define the font once per document. :ehp3.
After it is
defined, use the ".bf" command to start the font.
See Page 3 for some examples.
:dt..bf
:dd.This is the Begin Font control word.
:dt..pf
:dd.This is the Previous Font control word. It is used
to switch back to the font used before the current one.
It can be used to go back further, but can be hard to keep
track of becuase they are "nested."
:edl.
:p.
:h3.Important Information about Spacing
One thing to remember is that there are two types
of fonts:  proportionally spaced fonts and uniformly spaced fonts.
:ul.
:li.When you use a
proportional font the "i" takes up less width than an "m".
:li.When you use a
uniform font the "i" and the "m" both take the same amount
of width.
:eul.
:p.  Uniformly spaced fonts are quite useful when making columns and
charts, because your terminal displays uniformly spaced characters. So,
when you use a uniform font what you see on your screen is what you get
as far as spacing is concered.  In SCRIPT you'll need to turn formatting
off and back on to use this "what you see is what you get font."  (Use
".fo off" & ".fo on")
:p.  The use of "tabs" is another way to assist
with alignment when using either proportional or uniformly spaced fonts.
(Use .tp command)
:h3.GML tags to define typographical fonts
:p.There are seven Schwab developed commands available to define
different sets of fonts in all the
available sizes for any AFP printer.  They are:
:dl tsize=20
:dt.SOUVENIR
:dd.ITC Souvenir
:dt.MONOGARA
:dd.Monotype Garamond
:dt.SCHOOL
:dd.Century Schoolbook
:dt.F38SANS
:dd.Sonoran Sans Serif
:dt.F38SERIF
:dd.Sonoran Serif
:dt.PISANS
:dd.PI and Specials Sans Serif
:dt.PISERIF
:dd.PI and Specials Serif
:edl.
For most of your needs,
these seven tags will suffice. They load different families of fonts.
All seven tags use typographical fonts which are proportionally
spaced.
As a general rule of thumb,
try to use one font tag at a time,
or you will slow the printer down while
loading the fonts. One exception to the rule is the use of PISANS or
PISERIF.
You may want to use either PISANS or PISERIF along with one of the other
GML tags to enable use of special characters along with standard
alphanumeric characters.  (See appendix for further information.)
:p.Invoke the command at the beginning of the document.  For
example:
.sk
.fo off
.bx left 2i
.in2
&gml.f38sans
&gml.gdoc
......the rest of the document
.in
.bx off
.fo on
:p.All of the GML tag works exactly
the same way.  They include Century Schoolbook, ITC Souvenir, Monotype
Garamond, Sonoran Sans Serif, Sonoran Serif,
PI Serif, and PI San Serif
respectively.  The "PI" fonts are also known as "PI & Specials" and are
available in 6, 8, 10 and 12 points, they include special characters
such as
.df pi12 type('PI SERIF' 12) codepage T1GPI363
.bf pi12
.ti @ fc # 51 $ cb
T @ # $ W
.sp
.df srf18 type('SONORAN SERIF' 18) codepage T1DCDCFS
.bf srf18
.ti
.fo off
This is "text18" Sonoran Serif, followed by "pi12" PI Serif:
.bf pi12
.ti @ fc # 51 $ cb
This is text12 PI Serif using @ # $
.ti
.df ssrf18 type('SONORAN SANS SERIF' 18) codepage T1DCDCFS
.bf ssrf18
.sp
This is "text18" Sonoran Sans Serif, followed by "pi12" PI San Serif.
See the difference?
.df pisans12 type('PI SANS SERIF' 12) codepage T1GPI363
.bf pisans12
.ti @ fc # 51 $ cb
This is text12 PI San Serif using @ # $
.ti
.pf
.pf
.pf
.pf
.pf
.fo on
:h3.Other fonts
There are many other fonts available, however you will need to define
them in your script document to use them. The ".df" command can be
a little intimidating. So, just use the examples below exactly
as shown to achieve the desired effect.
Put all of your ".df" commands at the begining of your document and
then use the ".bf" control word to start the font.  Always use the
".pf" control word to return to the previous font or the default,
when you have finished with the use of the current font.
:hp3.Define each font only once per document
with the ".df" control word. :ehp3.
:p.You can explicitly define a font or "describe" the characteristics
of the font you wish to use.  If you want to name the precise font
you wish to use then use the "FONT" subparameter of the ".df" command.
If you want to be able to print on any printer and have the closest
match available use the "TYPE" subparameter of the ".df" command.
:hp3.Further information on Fonts can be found in IBM manual
"About Type:  IBM's Technical Reference for 240-pel Digitized Type"
number #S544-3516. :ehp3.
:p.IBM has supplied fonts for the 3800-type (Siemens 2300/2140)
printers and 3820-type printers in different libraries.  All fonts are
the same however the prefix is different for the two printer types.
When using the ".df" for the 3800-type printers use "X1" that is
".df sr12 font x1sr12".  The 3820-type printers use "X0" prefix, that
is ".df sr12 font x0sr12"
:p.The following examples are all using the
type parameter so it doesn't matter whether you print on 3820 type
printers or on the 10th floor of 101 Montgomery or in Brisbane.

:h4.Branch and other Managers
:p.Branch managers use the wire code instead of initials for
identification.  This reduces application changes when a branch manager
changes, only the page segment needs to be replaced with the new
signature.  The application will call the same page segment name, but
get the new signature.
