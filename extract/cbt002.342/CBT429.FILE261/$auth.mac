THE FOLLOWING MODULES ISSUE THE MODESET SVC, SO IF YOU
WANT TO RUN THEM UNDER TSO YOU HAVE TO BE AUTHORIZED.
THEY NEED TO ISSUE MODESET BECAUSE THEY USE TEST CHANNEL

    CSCGA03D  SE2GA03D   ACTIVITY MONITOR       RUNS UNDER CMDSBTSO
    CSCGE03D  SE2GE03D   EXCEPTION DISPLAY      RUNS UNDER CMDSBTSO
    CSCGO03D  SE2GO03D   I/O MONITOR            RUNS UNDER CMDSBTSO
    CSCZC03D             CHANNEL MONITOR        RUNS UNDER CMDSBTSO

THE FOLLOWING MODULES ISSUE THE MODSET SVC, BECAUSE THAT IS HOW
THEY HAVE TO RUN. YOU WOULD NOT ISSUE THESE UNDER TSO

    CMDSBINT       INITIALIZE AND MONITOR       RUN UNDER MASTER TCB
    CMDSBCSC       CROSS SYSTEM MONITOR         RUN CROSS SYSTEM
