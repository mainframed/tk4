//*  THIS MODULE SEARCHES THE CODE IT IS LOADING (#Q, #N, ETC.) TO  *
//*     SEE IF SUBPOOL 241 IS BEING REQUESTED FOR THE GETMAIN.  THIS*
//*     MODULE DOES THIS BY SEARCHING FOR X'F100' IN THE CODE.      *
//*     IF THE EXECUTION IS TAKING PLACE VIA THE SYSTEM CONSOLE,    *
//*     THEN SUBPOOL 241 IS ALLOWED.  IF THE EXECUTION IS TAKING    *
//*     PLACE WITHIN TSO, THEN THE X'F100' IS CHANGED TO X'0000'    *
//*     (FOR SUBPOOL 0) PRIOR TO THE ACTUAL EXECUTION OF THE CODE.  *
//*     IF THE PROPER CODING CONVENTIONS ARE NOT FOLLOWED IN THE    *
//*     SUB-MODULES (#Q, #N, ETC.), THIS CHECK MAY NOT BE SUCCESS-  *
//*     FUL, AND AN ABEND B0A WILL TAKE PLACE.                      *
