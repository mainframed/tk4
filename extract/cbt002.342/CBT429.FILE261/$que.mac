 NOV 10, 1982

 THE QUE COMMAND WAS PUT IN THIS SYSTEM MAINLY TO BE USED FOR
 THE STANDALONE VERSION OF THE # SYSTEM, I.E. CMDSBMON.

 THERE IS NO REAL NEED TO USE QUE UNDER THE TSO FULL SCREEN VERSION
 WHEN ONE CAN ACCESS THE NORMAL QUE BY TYPING IN .QUE

 NOW THE PROBLEM - THIS VERSION OF QUE IS QUITE OLD AND IT REQUIRES THE
 VERSION OF JES2 BEFORE THE DUAL CHECKPOINT PFT FOR JES2.

 BECAUSE OF THIS PROBLEM AS OF THIS DATE I AM GOING TO REPLACE
 CSCGQ03D WITH AN IEFBR14 WITH THE NAME OF CSCGQ03D IN THE LOAD
 LIBRARY  FILE 267 ON THE CBT MVS MODS TAPE.
