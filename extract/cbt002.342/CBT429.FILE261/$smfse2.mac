 IF YOU ARE RUNNING MVS/SE2 AND USING CROSS SYSTEM COMMUNICATION
 (CMDSBCSC) AND DOING STARTED TASK ACCOUNTING BE ALTERTED TO THE
 FACT THAT YOU WILL GENERATE A TYPE 14 AND TYPE 15 RECORD EVERY
 5 SECONDS WHEN THE # COMMAND CROSS SYSTEM PROGRAM CLOSES THE
 CSCDATA DATA SET (FROM EACH SYSTEM IT IS ACTIVE ON).

 THE CIRCUMVENTION IS:

  1). DON'T RECORD TYPE 14 AND 15 FROM STARTED TASKS
                       OR
  2). IN THE IEFU83 EXIT FILTER OUT TYPE 14 AND 15 RECORDS
      WRITTEN FROM CMD1
                       OR
  3). CHANGE THE CLOSE TO A TCLOSE
