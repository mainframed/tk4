WE AT BFG HAV CONVERTED THE # COMMAND SUBSYSTEM TO RUN ON ESA(CURRENTLY
AN EXPRESS ESA 3.1.0E AT 8903). THE CODE HAS HELD UP VERY WELL FROM
XA, ONLY TWO MODULES WERE MODIFIED:

  1. CSCSJ03D (#I) - CONTROL BLOCK SIZES CHANGED IN ESA (PART, SART)
  2. CSCSL03D (#J) - FIELD ASCBSEQN WAS REMOVED BY IBM.

FOR ADDTIONAL CHANGES SEE MEMBER $$$BFGXA WHICH SHOWS THE CHANGES
MADE TO SUPPORT XA 2.1.3 AND ABOVE.

IF YOU NEED TO USE THIS FOR AN XA SYSTEM THEN BACKOUT THE RENAMES IN
$MVSES31 WHICH WILL RETURN THIS TO THE XA LEVEL.


THE FOLLOWING CHART SUMMARIZES THE MODIFICATIONS AND CURRENT STATUS
OF THE DIFFERENT # SUBSYSTEM MODULES UNDER ESA.
