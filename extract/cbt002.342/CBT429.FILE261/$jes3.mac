THERE IS A PROBLEM UNDER JES3 WHEN A #T OR A #D (INTO
SOMEONES ADDRESS SPACE) IS ISSUED. THE JES3 CONSOLES
LOSE ROLL MODE.

WHAT IS THE PROBLEM?

IT APPEARS THAT THESE TWO COMMANDS ARE EXECUTED IN THE JES3
ADDRESS SPACE. SO FAR SO GOOD, HOWEVER THESE COMMANDS ISSUE
OS/MACROS (EXAMPLE STIMER) WHICH ARE ILLEGAL UNDER THE JES3
ADDRESS SPACE.

ILLEGAL OS/MACROS ARE DOCUMENTED IN A JES3 MANUAL (I DO NOT
KNOW THE MANUAL NAME OR NUMBER - IF AND WHEN I FIND OUT I WILL
DOCUMENT IT HERE).
