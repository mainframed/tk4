              THERE'S A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM WITH THE USE
              OF THE # COMMAND SUBSYSTEM (CMD1) AND A PTF
              ON PUT TAPE 8105.  WHEN CMD1 IS USED ON A
              SYSTEM THAT HAS PTF UZ35143, OR UZ35144, OR
              UZ35145 APPLIED YOU WILL BE PLACED IN THE
              SITUATION WHERE YOU WILL HAVE TO IPL !!!!
              YOUR SYSTEM WILL GO INTO A LOOP AND ALL YOUR
              WQE'S WILL BE  FILLED WITH AN  'ERROR
              ENCOUNTED IN IN CONTROL BLOCKS, RETRY
              COMMAND' MESSAGE. SOME SOLUTIONS TO THIS
              ARE:
                        1. DO NOT RUN CMD1
                        2. DO NOT PUT THE PTF ON
                        3. REMOVE ALL THE ESTAE'S FROM CMD1
                        4. CORRECT ALL THE ESTAE CODING   *

              THE PTF CHANGED MODULE IEE0003D AND THE
              MODULE NOW USES THE FAST ESTAE PATH  AND
              BECAUSE  OF THE WAY  ESTAE IS IMPLEMENTED IN
              CMD1 THERE IS A PROBLEM.  WE AT CBT ARE NOT
              CURRENTLY UP TO 8105.  EVENTUALLY WE HOPE TO
              FIX ALL THE ESATES SO  THEY  WORK CORRECTLY,
              IN  THE  MEANTIME THE QUICKEST AND FASTEST
              SOLUTION IS TO REMOVE  ALL THE ESATES.
              OBVIOUSLY IF YOU DO THIS AND CMD1 ABENDS YOU
              WILL GET AN SVC DUMP (C0D) INTO ONE OF YOUR
              SYS1.DUMP DATA SETS.
