WE AT BFG HAV CONVERTED THE # COMMAND SUBSYSTEM TO RUN ON XA (CURRENTLY
AN EXPRESS XA 2.1.3 AT 8501). IN DOING THIS WE FOUND SOME BUGS THAT
CROSS ALL THE MODULES:

  1. ESTAE PARMLIST LENGTH WAS HARD CODED, AND XA WAS LONGER. CAUSED
     MANY FUNNY BRANCHES NOT TO THE ESTAE ROUTINE.  THE CODE AT THE
     ESTAE ISSUANCE WAS CHANGED IN ALL MODULES HAVING ESTAES.  ALL
     ESTAES FOR XA WERE CHANGED TO RECORD ANY FAILURES IN LOGREC
     TO ALLOW EASIER DEBUGGING.
  2. CMDTSO DEPENDED ON R4 NOT BEING MODIFIED DURING THE CALLING OF
     ANY CSCXX03D MODULE. THIS RESTIRCTION DOES NOT EXIST IN THE
     CONSOLE COMMAND INVOCATION.  THUS CERTAIN COMMANDS BOMBED FOR
     NO APPARENT REASON. THIS WAS FIXED.

THIS FILE SUPERCEEDS BOTH FILES 409 AND 417, IN CURRENCY, AND IN FACT
BOTH THOSE FILES WERE MERGED INTO THIS AS A BASE FOR OUR CONVERSION.

WE ALSO FIXED ANY REENTRANCY PROBLEMS THAT OCCURED IN THE MODULES.
(YOU WOULD BE SUPPRISED WHAT WAS FOUND.)

CERTAIN MODULES WERE FIXED FOR XA AND SUPPORT ABOVE THE LINE PROCESSING:

  1. #S WILL NOW ACCEPT 4 BYTE ADDRESSES AND DISPLAY 4 BYTE ADDRESSES.
  2. #D WILL NOW ACCEPT 4 BYTE ADDRESSES AND DISPLAY 4 BYTE ADDRESSES.

#T HAS BEEN ENHANCED (REALLY FIXED) TO DISPLAY THE LAST LINE OF
ITS FORMAT DATA. PREVIOUSLY THE LAST ENTRY WAS SKIPPED.

THE FOLLOWING CHART SUMMARIZES THE MODIFICATIONS AND CURRENT STATUS
OF THE DIFFERENT # SUBSYSTEM MODULES UNDER XA.
