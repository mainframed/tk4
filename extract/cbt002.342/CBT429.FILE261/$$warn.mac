*   THE # COMMAND SUBSYSTEM IS A VERY VALUABLE TOOL, HOWEVER IN THE *
*   WRONG HANDS IT COULD REALLY RAISE HAVOC WITH YOUR SYSTEM. I AM  *
*   OF COURSE TALKING ABOUT THE #D COMMAND AND ITS SUBCOMMANDS.     *
*   BE VERY CAREFUL TO WHO YOU DISTRIBUTE ALL THE DOCUMENTATION     *
*   YOU MAY WANT TO MODIFY IT BEFORE YOU HAND IT OUT.               *
*                                                                   *
*   I HAVE BEEN TOLD (BUT DO NOT ACTAULLY KNOW) THAT IF YOU CHANGE  *
*   THE PRIORITY OF A TASK RUNNING IN THE ROTATE PRIORITY GROUP OR  *
*   TIME SLICE GROUP YOU MAY PUT THE SRM INTO A LOOP OR CAUSE THE   *
*   DISPATCHER TO OC4. FOR FURTHER INFORMATION YOU MAY WANT TO      *
*   LOOK AT APAR AZ38557. AS OF 9-18-79 I HAVE NOT SEEN THIS APAR   *
*   WRITE-UP.                                                       *
*                                                                   *

*                                                                   *
*              # D> # T AND LOSS OF CONSOLE ROLL                    *
*                 --------------------------                        *
*                                                                   *
*       YOU MAY LOSE DIDOCS CONSOLE ROLL AFTER YOU HAVE ISSUED      *
*       ONE OF THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS: #T (DISPLAY TIOT) OR         *
*       #D> (#D AGAINST ANOTHER ADDRESS SPACE). # T AND #D> HAVE    *
*       ONE THING IN COMMON THAT THE OTHER # COMMANDS DO NOT HAVE   *
*       (INCLUDING #D), THEY BOTH ISSUE SRB'S TO GET THEIR INFOR-   *
*       MATION. ALL # COMMANDS (EXCEPT ## MONITOR COMMANDS)         *
*       RUN UNDER THE MASTER SCHEDULER'S TCB. DIDOCS ALSO RUNS      *
*       UNDER THE MASTER. WHEN AN SRB IS SCHEDULED IN THE MASTER    *
*       ADDRESS SPACE DIDOCS IS SUSPENDED UNTIL COMPLETION, HERE    *
*       IS WHERE THE PROBLEM COMES IN (WE THINK). DIDOCS IS         *
*       SUSPENDED AND AT OUR INSTALLATION (CBT) WE HAVE ALL         *
*       OPERATOR CONSOLES ROLLING AT A 1 SECOND INTERVAL. WHAT WE   *
*       THINK IS HAPPENING IS THAT DIDOCS GETS HIS TIMER POP BEFORE *
*       THE SRB IS COMPLETED AND HE LOSES EITHER HIS TQE OR SOME    *
*       INDICATION THAT HIS TIMER HAS EXPIRED. ONCE WE LOSE ROLL    *
*       THE ONLY WAY WE CAN GET IT BACK IS TO RE-IPL. THIS PROBLEM  *
*       WOULD PROBABLY OCCUR IF THE SRB PROCESSING TOOK MORE THAN   *
*       ONE SECOND.  IF YOU WERE DOING A #T ON A TASK THAT HAD      *
*       MANY MANY DD CARDS IT COULD TAKE MORE THAN A SECOND.        *
*       IF THIS IS IN FACT THE PROBLEM THE OLDER VERSIONS OF THE    *
*       # COMMAND SUBSYSTEM THAT HAVE THE #X COMMAND COULD ALSO     *
*       HAVE THIS PROBLEM.                                          *
*       WE ARE GOING TO TRY AND APAR THIS SINCE IS SEEMS THAT THE   *
*       ERROR IS IN IBM CODE. THERE IS NO EXTERNAL APPEARANCE THAT  *
*       ROLL HAS BEEN LOST AND THERE ARE NO DUMPS TAKEN.            *
*                                                                   *
*       IT APPEARS TO CROP UP AT PTF LEVEL 7907 3.7 OR 3.8          *
