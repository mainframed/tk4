We at BFG hav converted the # command subsystem to run on ESA(currently
ESA 4.2 at 9103). The code has held up fairly well from ESA 3.1 and
XA, only one major change has affected things:

  1. The CSCB has been moved above the line.

Unfortunately this may affect a number of modules:

  1. CMDSBINIT  -  Initialization was changed to use EXTRACT to get
     the address of the MODIFY/PURGE ECB.
  2. CSCSL03D (#J) - OUCB flag OUCBCPL (heavy CPU user) has been
     removed.
  3. CSCSJ03D (#I) - Added proper titles for additional swap counts.
  4. CSCSC03D (#L) - The CSCB moved above 31 bit line so need to change
     the AMODE.

For additional changes see members $$$BFGES and $$$BFGXA.

The following chart summarizes the modifications and current status
of the different # subsystem modules under ESA.
