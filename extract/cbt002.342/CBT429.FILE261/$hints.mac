//*     AREA DOES AND THEY HAD TROUBLE WITH THE COMMAND SUBSYSTEM.  *
//*     IT SEEMS THAT THE '#' IS THE DEFAULT FOR EITHER THE END     *
//*     OF LINE CHARACTER OR THE LINE DELETE CHARACTER. WHAT        *
//*     EVER IT IS WHEN YOU TYPE IN THE COMMAND IT NEVER GETS TO    *
//*     THE SUBSYSTEM. NOT TOO HELPFUL !!!!. TO INVOKE THE SUBSYSTEM*
//*     YOU HAVE TO EITHER CHANGE THE CONSOLE STANDARD CARD IN YOUR *
//*     JES3 INITIZIATION DECK FROM THE '#' DEFAULT TO SOMETHING    *
//*     ELSE OR MODIFY THE SUBSYSTEM TO RECOGNIZE SOMETHING OTHER   *
//*     THAN '#'. MODIFICATION OF THE SUBSYSTEM IS PROBABLY THE     *
//*     BIGGER JOB OF THE TWO ALTERNATIVES.                         *
//*                                                                 *

//*     YOU MAY LOSE DIDOCS CONSOLE ROLL AFTER YOU HAVE ISSUED      *
//*     ONE OF THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS: #T (DISPLAY TIOT) OR         *
//*     #D> (#D AGAINST ANOTHER ADDRESS SPACE). # T AND #D> HAVE    *
//*     ONE THING IN COMMON THAT THE OTHER # COMMANDS DO NOT HAVE   *
//*     (INCLUDING #D), THEY BOTH ISSUE SRB'S TO GET THEIR INFOR-   *
//*     MATION. ALL # COMMANDS (EXCEPT ## MONITOR COMMANDS)         *
//*     RUN UNDER THE MASTER SCHEDULER'S TCB. DIDOCS ALSO RUNS      *
//*     UNDER THE MASTER. WHEN AN SRB IS SCHEDULED IN THE MASTER    *
//*     ADDRESS SPACE DIDOCS IS SUSPENDED UNTIL COMPLETION, HERE    *
//*     IS WHERE THE PROBLEM COMES IN (WE THINK). DIDOCS IS         *
//*     SUSPENDED AND AT OUR INSTALLATION (CBT) WE HAVE ALL         *
//*     OPERATOR CONSOLES ROLLING AT A 1 SECOND INTERVAL. WHAT WE   *
//*     THINK IS HAPPENING IS THAT DIDOCS GETS HIS TIMER POP BEFORE *
//*     THE SRB IS COMPLETED AND HE LOSES EITHER HIS TQE OR SOME    *
//*     INDICATION THAT HIS TIMER HAS EXPIRED. ONCE WE LOSE ROLL    *
//*     THE ONLY WAY WE CAN GET IT BACK IS TO RE-IPL. THIS PROBLEM  *
//*     WOULD PROBABLY OCCUR IF THE SRB PROCESSING TOOK MORE THAN   *
//*     ONE SECOND.  IF YOU WERE DOING A #T ON A TASK THAT HAD      *
//*     MANY MANY DD CARDS IT COULD TAKE MORE THAN A SECOND.        *
//*     IF THIS IS IN FACT THE PROBLEM THE OLDER VERSIONS OF THE    *
//*     # COMMAND SUBSYSTEM THAT HAVE THE #X COMMAND COULD ALSO     *
//*     HAVE THIS PROBLEM.                                          *
//*     WE ARE GOING TO TRY AND APAR THIS SINCE IS SEEMS THAT THE   *
//*     ERROR IS IN IBM CODE. THERE IS NO EXTERNAL APPEARANCE THAT  *
//*     ROLL HAS BEEN LOST AND THERE ARE NO DUMPS TAKEN.            *
//*                                                                 *
//*     THIS SEEMS TO HAVE STARTED WITH 7907 ON 3.7 AND 3.8         *

//*     THERE IS A FIX FOR THIS PROBLEM IN THE MEMBER CALLED        *
