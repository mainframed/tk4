   THIS VERSION HAS THE FOLLOWING FEATURES:

             0. FOR THE #D COMMAND IF YOU WANT TO ISSUE THE
                #DDOSWAP,ASID BE SURE YOU CHANGE THE CONSTANT
                CALLED SWAPPG WITH THE PERFORMANCE GROUP NO. IN YOUR
                INSTALLATION THAT WILL PERMANENTLY SWAP OUT A TASK.
                (PUT TASK INTO A DOMAIN THAT HAS A MIN AND MAX OF 0).
                THE DEFAULT IS A PERFORMANCE GROUP OF 5

             1. FOR THE FOLLOWING PROGRAMS MAKE SURE THE CONTSTANT
                'THRTSOGP' IS A VALID TSO PERFORMANCE GROUP NUMBER
                FOR YOUR INSTALLATION: GSCGE03D, CSCGO03D AND
                CSCGA03D. NO BIG PROBLEMS IF YOU DO NOT
                CHANGE IT, YOU GET THE MESSAGE: 'ERROR ENCOUNTERED IN
                CONTROL BLOCKS - RETRY COMMAND'.

             2. THE EXCEPTION DISPLAY PROGRAM (CSCGE03D) HAS TO RUN
                AC=1 (DOES TEST CHANNEL INSTRUCTIONS). THIS IS NO PROB-
                LEM FOR THE STANDALONE MONITOR BUT A PROBLEM IF YOU WANT
                TO USE IT ON TSO. YOU WILL HAVE TO PUT CMDSBTSO INTO
                THE PROPER TABLE(S) SO WHEN IKJEFT01 ATTACHES CMDSBTSO
                IT WILL NOT ATTACH HIM NOT AUTHORIZED. WE AT CBT USE
                OUR OWN SVC TO LET HIM RUN AUTHORIZED. YOU CAN ALSO
                USE THE #DS COMMAND TO GET AROUND THIS IF YOU SO WISH.

             3. NUMBER TWO ABOVE ALSO HOLD TRUE FOR CSCGO03D AND CSCGA03
