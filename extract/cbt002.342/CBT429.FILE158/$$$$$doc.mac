   This file was submitted to the SHARE diskettes by Robert Iappini.
   This file was converted from having some members with sequence
    numbers in columns 1-8 to those members having sequence numbers
    in columns 73-80 (by Sam Golob).  That's so the members can be
    properly interpreted in a FB-80 environment by REXX.

   These EXECs originally ran in a VB-255 environment.
