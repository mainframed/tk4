                  MVS REASM

          Copyright (c) 1992,  Valentin Chernyak.



    This floppy contains the MVS interactive disassembler "REASM 2.2".
It is your own PRIVATE copy. No part from the REASM manual or REASM
panels may be copied or reproduced without written permission from
Valentin Chernyak.

 (Manual is not yet included in this package.  Use the interactive
  tutorials until I can get the manual reformatted.     SG )

    REASMDOC.ZIP file contains the REASM manual. It may be printed with
MicroSoft Word (tm) 5.5 or MicroSoft Word 2.0 for Windows (tm). Beware
of my English ! This manual was written 2 years ago in the times when my
English was even worth less than now (can you believe ?). Some parts of
the manual are obsolete. I apologize for this inconvenience and promise
to take care about new good documentation as soon as I upgrade my PC to
something decent...

 Quick start:


 1) Copy and unload all the libraries to the MVS

 2) Concatenate ISPF libraries: LOAD, PLIB and MLIB

 3) Allocate new DD card:
    //REASMBLK DD DSN=MVS.REASM.CNTL,DISP=SHR

 4) Add new item to ISPF menu:  " ...    PGM(REASM) ..."
    or just call REASM from ISPF 7.0.

 5) Enjoy...



   I appreciate any comments, complaints and suggestions about this
product. Good luck.
