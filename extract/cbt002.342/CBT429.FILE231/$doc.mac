$DOC - DOCUMENTATION FOR TASKLIST SOURCE LIBRARY

THIS MEMBER DESCRIBES THE TASKLIST APPLICATION, WHAT THE PIECES ARE, HOW
TO PUT IT TOGETHER, AND HOW TO EXECUTE IT.

UPDATED 11/11/86: I HAVE REMEMBERED TO INCLUDE THE "TASKPRT" SKELETON
AND PANEL "TASKNDSN" IN THIS LIBRARY, AND I'VE INCLUDED PROGRAM X1A100
ALONG WITH NOTES ABOUT WHAT IT IS.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADMINISTRIVIA (I HAVE TO PUT THIS IN HERE OR THEY FIRE ME):

THIS APPLICATION WAS DEVELOPED BY:
  JOE VEILLEUX
  MIS CENTRAL SOFTWARE SERVICES - ADMIN III
  AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. (SHARE INSTALLATION CODE APC).
  P.O. BOX 538
  ALLENTOWN, PA 18105
  (215) 481-4558

NEITHER JOE VEILLEUX NOR AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS ASSUMES ANY
REPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONTINUED HEALTH OR SANITY OF ANYONE WHO CHOOSES
TO USE THIS APPLICATION, ETC., ETC., ETC.  THE APPLICATION MAY BE SHARED
WITH ANY WILLING PARTY AS LONG AS NO MONEY CHANGES HANDS. THIS IS MEANT
TO BE A SAMPLE OF USING ISPF TABLE SERVICES FOR SOMETHING USEFULL (OR
REASONABLY SO), AND IS CERTAINLY NOT INTENDED TO BE A COMERCIALLY-
VIABLE SOFTWARE PRODUCT (I DO A BETTER JOB ON THE STUFF I SELL).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

WHAT THE APPLICATION IS:

THE TASKLIST APPLICATION IS A SET OF ISPF COMPONENTS (A CLIST, SEVERAL
PANELS, A SKELETON, AND A MESSAGE MEMBER) WHICH LETS YOU MAINTAIN AN
ONLINE THINGS-TO-DO LIST. YOU CAN SORT THE LIST VARIOUS WAYS, PRINT THE
LIST, UPDATE TASK DESCRIPTIONS/PRIORITIES/DATE-DUE/ETC.  IN SHORT, IT'S
A FAIRLY USEFUL LITTLE TOOL FOR ORGANIZING LISTS OF STUFF YOU'VE GOT TO
GET DONE (I ALWAYS LIKED ORGANIZING BETTER THAN DOING, ANYWAY).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

HOW DO I GET IT TO OPERATE?

ONCE YOU'VE GOT THIS PDS ON DISK, COPY THE MEMBER "SPTASKDR" TO YOUR
INSTALLATION'S CLIST LIBRARY (OR TO YOUR OWN PRIVATE CLIST LIBRARY
ALLOCATED TO DDNAME "SYSPROC"), COPY "TASK00" TO YOUR ISPF MESSAGE
LIBRARY, COPY "TASKPRT" TO YOUR ISPF FILE-TAYLORING SKELETON LIBRARY,
AND COPY ALL THE OTHER MEMBERS TO YOUR ISPF PANEL LIBRARY. JUMP INTO
ISPF AND INVOKE MENU 7.1 ("INVOKE DIALOG FUNCTION/SELECTION MENU"
SUBOPTION OF THE DIALOG TEST FACILITY).  FILL IN "%SPTASKDR" IN THE
"CMD" FIELD, AND HIT ENTER.  YOU SHOULD BE GREETED WITH A PANEL CALLED
"ONLINE TASKS-LIST UPDATE PANEL", AND THERE SHOULD BE A MESSAGE SAYING
"TASKS-LIST CREATED" IN THE SHORT MESSAGE FIELD.  THERE WILL BE AN EMPTY
LIST OF TASKS UNDER THE COLUMN HEADINGS (HOW DO YOU LIST AN EMPTY LIST,
ANYWAY???).

THE SHORT MESSAGE IS WARNING YOU THAT IT DIDN'T FIND A TASKLIST TABLE,
SO IT HAS CREATED ONE FOR YOU.  **THIS IS NORMAL** THE FIRST TIME YOU
INVOKE THE APPLICATION.

HIT ENTER ONCE TO CLEAR THE SHORT MESSAGE, THEN HIT PF1 TO JUMP INTO THE
GENERAL SECTION OF THE TUTORIAL.  VIEW THE TUTORIAL SEQUENTIALLY BY
HITTING ENTER REPEATEDLY (THIS SAVES ME FROM HAVING TO EXPLAIN HOW TO
USE THE APPLICATION HERE).

BEFORE YOU TRY TO ACTUALLY USE THE "PRINT" OPTION, LOOK AT THE NOTE
BELOW ABOUT PROGRAM X1A100 AND FOLLOW ITS RECOMENDATION.

ONCE YOU HAVE CHECKED-OUT THE APPLICATION AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, YOU'LL
PROBABLY WANT TO MAKE IT A LITTLE EASIER FOR YOUR USERS TO INVOKE THE
APPLICATION. ADD AN ENTRY TO ONE OF YOUR EXISTING ISPF SELECTION MENUS
(ISR@PRIM OR ANY OTHER SELECTION MENU). THE SELECTION SHOULD INVOKE
COMMAND "%SPTASKDR":

              ' ',' '
                *,'?' )
  &ZTRAIL = .TRAIL
)END

I LIKE TO ALLOW BOTH THE NUMBER ("1") AND THE NAME OF THE APPLICATION
("TASK") TO BE USED TO SELECT AN APPLICATION.

* * * PLEASE NOTE: * * *
PROGRAM X1A100: THIS IS A PL/1 PROGRAM WHICH IS USED BY THE SPTASKDR
CLIST TO GET INFORMATION FROM THE TSO SESSION'S JOB CARD (SPECIFICALLY,
USER'S NAME). TO DO THIS, IT CALLS A LOCALLY-WRITTEN SUBROUTINE CALLED
"ACOUNT" WHICH I HAVEN'T INCLUDED SINCE I'M SURE IT WON'T WORK ON
ANYONE'S SYSTEM BUT OURS (OR AT LEAST I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT IT TO BE
SURE IT WILL). IF YOU HAVE A SIMILAR PROGRAM, YOU COULD CHANGE THE CALL
TO "ACOUNT" IN THE X1A100 PROGRAM TO CALL YOUR PROGRAM. THEN, COMPILE
AND LINK X1A100 AND PUT IT INTO YOUR ISPF LOAD LIBRARY (DDNAME ISPLLIB
OR IN STEPLIB OR THE SYSTEM LINK LIST). IF YOU DON'T HAVE SUCH A
PROGRAM, JUST COMMENT-OUT THE CALL TO X1A100 IN THE SPTASKDR CLIST AND
(IF YOU FEEL LIKE IT) REMOVE THE REFERENCE TO &JCNAME IN THE TASKPRT
SKELETON.  THE LISTING WILL THEN PRINT WITHOUT THE USER'S NAME IN THE
TITLE, BUT THAT'S LIFE.

IF YOU HAVE TROUBLE GETTING THE APPLIATION TO WORK OR IF YOU HAVE
QUESTIONS ABOUT ISPF TABLE HANDLING, FEEL FREE TO CALL OR WRITE TO ME,
OR CATCH ME AT SHARE (I'LL BE THE ONE LEAVING SCIDS LAST).
