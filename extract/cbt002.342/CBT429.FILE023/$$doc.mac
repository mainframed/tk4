--- FUNCTION ---

THIS EXIT AND MODIFICATION WILL ALLOW A TSO USER TO LOGON TO AN
ALTERNATE JES2 (SECONDARY JES2 RUNNING UNDER A PRIMARY JES2).
THE TSO LOGON PROCESS IS IDENTICAL TO THE NORMAL PROCESSING PERFORMED
BY A PRIMARY JES2 (UNLIKE OTHER TECHNIQUES WHICH START A TSO SESSION
UNDER A DIFFERANT NAME ON THE SECONDARY JES2 (I.E. SYSLOG)).

THE TSO ADDRESS SPACE IS STARTED BY THE SPECIFIED SECONDARY JES2 AND
ALL TSO FUNCTIONS REQUESTING JES2 SERVICES (SUBMIT, STATUS, OUTPUT,
CANCEL, ISPF 3.8, ETC.) ARE HANDLED BY THE SECONDARY JES2.  JOBS
SUBMITTED FROM A TSO SESSION RUNNING UNDER A SECONDARY JES2, WILL RUN
UNDER THE SAME SECONDARY JES2.

--- USES ---

BY FAR THE MOST COMMON USE OF ALTJES IS IN THE TESTING OF A NEW JES2
RELEASE.  TSO INTERFACES, JOB SUBMISSION, AND JOB EXECUTION CAN ALL
BE TESTED BY USING A SECONDARY JES2.  THIS ALLOWS THE PRODUCTION SYSTEM
TO CONTINUE AS A NEW JES2 IS BEING TESTED.  USERS CAN BE ALLOWED TO
LOGON TO THE NEW JES2 AND PERFORM TESTING DURING NORMAL WORKING HOURS.

AS THE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY JES2 DO NOT SHARE SPOOL OTHER APPLICATIONS
ARE CONCEIVEABLE (OUTPUT ISOLATION, ETC.)

--- SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS & MISC ---

 - MVS SP1.3.3 JES2 OR HIGHER INCLUDING XA (SUPPORT FOR SUB=)
 - THIS EXIT/MOD HAS BEEN TESTED AT MVS SP1.3.4 (JBB1329), SP2.1.1
   (JBB2110), SP2.1.2 (JBB2125), AND SP2.1.3 (JBB2133)
   WITH JES2 AT SP1.3.4, SP1.3.6 AND SP2.1.5
 - EXIT/MOD HAS BEEN RUNNING ON SP2.1.1-SP2.1.3 SYSTEM FOR 2 YEARS
 - NON-XA TESTING WAS DONE AT TIME OF DEVELOPMENT AND NOT AT TIME OF
   PREPARATION FOR DISTRIBUTION

--- REQUESTING ALTERNATE JES2 LOGON ---

TO REQUEST THAT A TSO LOGON BE MADE UNDER A SECONDARY JES2, AN
ADDITIONAL LOGON KEYWORD OF 'ALTJES(XXXX)' IS USED WHERE XXXX REPRESENTS
THE SECONDARY JES2 NAME (NORMALLY JESA OR JESB). FOR EXAMPLE:

        LOGON USERID PROC(TSOPROC) ALTJES(JESA) SIZE(1024)

THE PRELIMINARY PROCESSING OF THE ALTJES KEYWORD IS HANDLED BY THE
TSO LOGON PRE-PROMPT EXIT ROUTINE IKJEFLD WHICH BECOMES PART OF IKJEFLA.
SEE 'SYSTEM PROGRAMMING LIBRARY: TSO' FOR MORE INFORMATION OF THE LOGON
PRE-PROMPT EXIT.  IKJEFLD PARSES THE ALTJES KEYWORD AND PLACES THE
SPECIFIED SECONDARY JES2 NAME IN A RESERVED FIELD IN THE JSCB THAT WILL
BE USED FOR THE TSO LOGON.

--- SECURITY PACKAGE CONSIDERATIONS ---

SOME SECURITY PACKAGES (I.E. ACF2) MAY ALREADY MAKE USE OF IKJEFLD.  IN
SUCH CASES THE SUPPLIED IKJEFLD WILL HAVE TO BE INVOKED AS A USER
EXIT OF IKJEFLD.  INSTALLATIONS RUNNING SECURITY PACKAGES OTHER THAN
ACF2 SHOULD CONSULT THE DOCUMENTATION FOR YOUR SECURITY PACKAGE FOR
FURTHER INFORMATION.  ACF2 USERS CAN INSTALL THE SUPPLIED IKJEFLD AS
USREFLD.

SOME SECURITY PACKAGES MAY ALSO CONTROL THE VALIDITY OF LOGON KEYWORDS.
IN SUCH CASES THE 'ALTJES(XXXX)' KEYWORD WILL HAVE TO BE DEFINED TO THE
SECURITY PACKAGE.  FOR ACF2, THE ALTJES KEYWORD CAN BE DEFINED BY

     SET CONTROL(GSO)
     SET SYSID(SYS*)
     LIST TSOKEYS
     INSERT TSOKEYS KEYWORDS(ALTJES)
     LIST TSOKEYS

ACF2 ALSO REQUIRES MODULES ACFRJESX AND ACFUJESX, WHERE 'X' IS THE
SECONDARY JES SUFFIX (I.E. ACFRJESA AND ACFUJESA FOR JESA).

--- IEESB605 MODIFICATION ---

THE HEART OF 'ALTJES' IS THE MODIFICATION TO IEESB605.  THIS MOD (WHICH
IS SUPPLED IN SMP FORMAT) REDIRECTS TSO LOGON PROCESSING TO A SPECIFIED
SECONDARY JES2.  THE REDIRECTION IS ACHIEVED BY THE SIMULATION OF A SUB=
PARAMETER ON THE TSO LOGON.  THE SUB= PARAMETER IS NORMALLY USED TO
DIRECT THE STARTING OF A STARTED TASK TO A SECONDARY JES2.  THE JES2
NAME STORED IN THE JSCB BY THE LOGON PRE-PROMPT EXIT IS USED FOR THE
SIMULATED SUB=.  IF THE SPECIFIED JES2 IS NOT ACTIVE, NORMAL MVS
PROCESSING HANDLES TASK TERMINATION.

--- INSTALLING IKJEFLA ---

IF IKJEFLD IS ALREADY IN USE (SECURITY PACKAGE ETC.) EDIT MEMBER IKJEFLD
AND CHANGE THE 'CSECT' AND 'USING' TO THE REQUIRED NAME.

MEMBER 'ASMLKED' WILL ASSEMBLE IKJEFLD, AND LINK IT INTO IKJEFLA.
THE JOB ALSO APF AUTHORIZES IKJEFLA AND IEEPRWI2.  AS IKJEFLD USES
MODESET BEFORE IT STORES THE SECONDARY JES2 NAME INTO THE JSCB, IKJEFLA
MUST BE AUTHORIZED.  IEEPRWI2 DOES AN XCTL TO IKJEFLA AND THEREFORE IT
MUST ALSO BE AUTHORIZED.  ABEND S047 IN IKJEFLD WILL OCCUR IF THE
STARTED TASK CONTROL PROCESS (IEEPRWI2 AND IKJEFLA) WHICH RECEIVES
CONTROL FROM THE REGION CONTROL TASK IS NOT APF AUTHORIZED.  IF YOUR
SHOP HAS A MODESET-LIKE SVC THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE APF AUTHORIZATION,
YOU MAY CHOOSE TO CHANGE THE MODESETS IN IKJEFLD AND BYPASS THE APF
AUTHORIZING OF IKJEFLA AND IEEPRWI2.

EDIT MEMBER ASMLKED
 - NON-XA SITES WILL HAVE TO CHANGE THE ASSEMBLE NAME
 - SPECIFY SYS1.AMODGEN VOLSER IF NOT CATALOGED
 - SPECIFY DATASET NAME FOR SYSIN
 - REPLACE LINKAGE EDITOR CONTROL STATEMENTS FOR IKJEFLA LINK WITH
   THE CONTROL STATEMENTS FROM YOUR CURRENT STAGE1 OR FROM SMP
   'LIST LMOD(IKJEFLA).'.  DO NOT REMOVE THE 'SETCODE AC(1)',
   'INCLUDE OBJFILE', OR 'NAME IKJEFLA(R)'.
 - SPECIFY VOLSER FOR SYS1.LPALIB AND SYS1.SVCLIB (2ND AND 3RD STEPS)
 - RUN THE JOB

--- INSTALLING THE IEESB605 MOD ---

 - NON-XA SHOPS SHOULD USE THE USERMOD $ALTJES FROM MEMBER SP1MOD
 - XA SHOPS SHOULD USE THE USERMOD $ALTJES FROM MEMBER SP2MOD
 - EDIT THE $ALTJES USERMOD AND SPECIFY THE CORRECT FMID
 - USE SMP OR SMPE
 - RECEIVE THE $ALTJES USERMOD
 - APPLY CHECK $ALTJES
 - APPLY $ALTJES SPECIFING LPALIB AS 'SYS1.SVCLIB'

--- TESTING ---

 - COPY MEMBER IEALPAXX INTO SYS1.PARMLIB
 - IPL SYSTEM WITH 'MLPA=(XX)'
 - BRING UP PRIMARY JES2
 - LOGON TO TSO, CHECK AS PER NORMAL, LOGOFF

 - BRING UP SECONDARY JES2 (JESA)
 - LOGON TO TSO SPECIFING 'ALTJES(JESA)'
 - PERFORM TESTING (JOB SUBMISSION, STATUS, CANCEL, OUTPUT, ETC.)

--- TSO LOGON COMMAND ---

IT IS IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT THE TSO 'LOGON' COMMAND CREATES A NEW
TSO SESSION USING THE SAME JSCB AS THE TERMINATING SESSION.  AS A
RESULT, IF A TSO SESSION THAT IS RUNNING UNDER A SECONDARY JES2, USES
THE TSO 'LOGON' COMMAND, THE NEW TSO SESSION WILL BE STARTED BY THE SAME
SECONDARY JES2.  TO START A NEW TSO SESSION UNDER THE PRIMARY JES2 WHEN
USING THE TSO 'LOGON' COMMAND, SPECIFY THE KEYWORD AS 'ALTJES(JES2)'.

--- COMPLETE INSTALLATION ---

 - AFTER SUCCESSFUL TESTING,
   COPY IEESB065, IKJEFLA, AND IEEPRWI2  FROM 'SYS1.SVCLIB' TO
   'SYS1.LPALIB'
