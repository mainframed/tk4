                 CDCSA CICS CROSS SYSTEM FACILITY

      The CDCSA CICS Cross System Facility is an adaptation of the
CDCSA MVS Cross System Facility which is on File 204 of the CBT MVS
Tape.  The idea is that this ISPF application allows the central
SMP/E maintenance of CICS.  If you have lots of regions to bring the
maintenance to, you can easily clone it, and keep both a central and
a local record of what is going on.

      It is not so easy for me to document this facility, because
I am not a CICS systems programmer (at this stage of my career).
However, it is fairly straightforward, and it will be very clear,
especially if you've seen how the corresponding MVS facility works.
The clist called XALC gets everything started.

      As in the other versions of this facility, each member of this
file is a partitioned dataset in itself.  At our site, the dataset
prefix to each member is XCICS.TSOISPF.  In other words, if the pds
member is called CLIST, the pds it is supposed to expand to, is really
called XCICS.TSOISPF.CLIST.  You must, of course, tailor these names
to something appropriate for your installation.  Also, these names
are probably hard-coded in the clists, skeletons, etc. and they
have to be globally changed to adjust to the names you are going
to use.

      Use the PDSLOAD program to re-constitute the requisite pds'es
from each member of this file.  A sample job is in member $PDSLOAD.

      The CHANGES member comes from a dataset called
XCICS.SOFTWARE.CHANGES.

      The CICS facility is not as robust as it could be, because
neither Ken nor I does CICS, and the CICS people in our shop don't
seem to be completely consistent in their use of this stuff.  The
DB2 part is the most complete, because Ken does his work there (he
is the DB2 DBA).  Nevertheless, there is a lot of good stuff here
upon which to build.  If you use this facility, please let us know
what you've done.

      Some of the material on this file may refer to materials on
File 204 of the CBT Tape.  The DB2 system is on File 212.
