A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE CUT AND PASTE EDIT MACROS.     APRIL 25 1991

THESE CUT AND PASTE EDIT MACROS WERE WRITTEN BY BILL GODFREY,
OF PRC INC. (FORMERLY PLANNING RESEARCH CORPORATION), MCLEAN, VIRGINIA.

THE AUTHOR HAD SEEN SOME MACROS WRITTEN AS CLISTS THAT PERFORM A
SIMILAR FUNCTION, BUT THE CLISTS USED THE ISPF PROFILE DATA SET AS A
HOLDING AREA FOR THE CUT DATA, AND THE AUTHOR FELT THERE HAD TO BE A
BETTER WAY.  THE CLISTS ARE IMPRESSIVE, AND THERE PROBABLY IS NO BETTER
WAY TO WRITE THEM IF THEY HAVE TO BE CLISTS.  I NEEDED CUT AND PASTE,
AND IT WAS TIME I LEARNED HOW TO WRITE AN EDIT MACRO, SO I WROTE THIS
VERSION OF CUT AND PASTE, NOT AS CLISTS BUT IN ASSEMBLER.  THE CLISTS
WERE A GREAT HELP AS AN INITIAL MODEL.

CUT AND PASTE WERE WRITTEN TO LOOK AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE LIKE THE EDIT
'COPY' COMMAND, SO IF YOU KNOW 'COPY' YOU KNOW CUT AND PASTE.

THE USER TYPES "CUT" ON THE COMMAND LINE AND THEN USES THE "C"
LINE COMMAND THE SAME WAY IT IS USED BY THE "COPY" COMMAND (THAT IS,
C ON ONE LINE OR CC ON TWO LINES), OR THE USER TYPES "CC" ON ONE
LINE, PAGES UP OR DOWN TO ANOTHER LINE, TYPES "CC" THERE, AND THEN
TYPES "CUT" ON THE COMMAND LINE.

THE DATA WILL BE COPIED TO A "TEMPORARY LOCATION" (ACTUALLY A VIO
DATA SET).

THE USER CAN PASTE IT BACK TO THE SAME DATA SET BEING EDITED, BUT
THAT'S NOTHING NEW - YOU DON'T NEED CUT AND PASTE FOR THAT (ALTHOUGH
THE ABILITY TO REPEATEDLY PASTE THE SAME THING IS NEW).

THE USER CAN ALSO PASTE IT BACK TO A DIFFERENT DATA SET.  FIRST HE OR
SHE MUST GET INTO EDIT ON THE DATA SET INTO WHICH IT IS TO BE PASTED.
THE USER MAY ALREADY BE THERE ON A SPLIT SCREEN, OR MAY ALREADY BE
THERE IN A NESTED EDIT, OR MAY WANT TO END THE CURRENT EDIT AND START
ANOTHER - IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE.  ONCE THE USER IS IN EDIT ON THE
DESIRED DATA SET, HE OR SHE JUST HAS TO TYPE "PASTE" ON THE COMMAND
LINE AND AND "A" (AFTER) OR "B" (BEFORE) LINE COMMAND ON THE DESIRED
LINE, AND THE DATA THAT WAS CUT TO THE "TEMPORARY LOCATION" WILL BE
COPIED INTO PLACE.

THAT IS HOW CUT AND PASTE ARE MOST OFTEN USED, BUT THERE IS MORE.

THERE ARE IN FACT NINE "TEMPORARY LOCATIONS" IN WHICH TO HOLD CUT
LINES, SO YOU CAN DO SEVERAL CUTS FROM ONE EDIT AND THEN SEVERAL
PASTES LATER ON. (CUT, CUT 2, CUT 3...CUT 9) (PASTE, PASTE 2...)

USING THE "M" LINE COMMAND INSTEAD OF "C" WILL CAUSE THE LINES TO
BE DELETED AS THEY ARE CUT.

INSTEAD OF LINE COMMANDS YOU CAN USE LABELS, JUST LIKE THE "COPY"
COMMAND.

THE DETAILS ARE ON THE HELP SCREEN, WHICH IS DISPLAYED BY ENTERING
"CUT ?" AND "PASTE ?" ON THE COMMAND LINE.  (SEE MEMBER CUTH01).

THE "TEMPORARY LOCATIONS" ARE LOST WHEN YOU LOGOFF, AND ARE PROBABLY
DELETED BY "FREEALL" COMMANDS TOO, SO BE CAREFUL WITH "FREEALL".

THERE IS A LIMIT OF 1000 LINES PER "TEMPORARY LOCATION", BUT IT IS JUST
AN ARBITRARY NUMBER CHOSEN TO NOT WASTE LARGE AMOUNTS OF VIO SPACE.  IF
YOU CHANGE THE LIMIT BY MODIFYING THE SOURCE CODE, CHANGE THE SPACE
ALLOCATIONS FOR VIO IN THE SAME PROGRAM.

ONE THING THAT A CLIST VERSION OF CUT-AND-PASTE DOES THAT THIS VERSION
DOES NOT DO IS RECOGNIZE BOUNDS WITHIN A LINE.  THE AUTHOR HAS NOT PUT
THIS FEATURE IN MAINLY BECAUSE NEITHER HE HIMSELF NOR THE CLIENT HE
SERVES HAS A GREAT NEED FOR IT, AND THERE IS PLENTY OF OTHER WORK TO DO.
