1.1. The MVS/TSO File System

The  features  of  the TSO file system of greatest interest to Kermit us
the format of file specifications (filespecs) and the concept of records
latter is described in the Kermit-370 chapter.

The MVS/TSO filespec (called the data set name or DSN) takes the form of
(known as qualifiers) of up to 8 alphanumeric  characters  each,  separa
periods.    Each qualifier must begin with an alphabetic or national cha
The total length must be no more than 44 characters, including periods.
precise,  a  DSN may contain uppercase letters, digits, and the special
ters "$" (dollar sign), "#" (pound sign), "@" (at sign), and  "-"  (hyph
addition to the separating periods.  Other characters may be not be incl

There  is  another, structural restriction on data set names from the fa
TSO data sets are all cataloged.  In a standard MVS catalog, each qualif
each  DSN is associated with an index of the same name.  The index is a
chical catalog component which points downward either to a list  of  nex
indices  or to a data set, but never to both.  Consequently, a cataloged
a chain of indices corresponding one-for-one with DSN qualifers, and  th
index  is  a  pointer  to the data set itself.  While there may be many
with the same name, no two such duplicates may both  be  chained  to  th
next-higher-level  index,  so  that,  if  DSN's  are  considered  as str
qualifiers (not of characters), no DSN can be a major substring of  any
For  example,  if  the  name  'A.BB.C'  exists  in the catalog, then 'A.
'A.BB.C.X' are illegal, but 'A.B', 'A.BB.Y', 'A.BBB',  and  'A.BB.BB'  a
legal.

A  DSN  given  in  its entirety (as in the foregoing examples) is called
qualified" and must be enclosed in single quotes when entered in TSO.  H
by  convention (and by definition) the first qualifier of each data set
ing to a given user must be the user's logon ID, and, by default,  that
the  assumed  prefix in TSO when a DSN is not enclosed in quotes.  In pr
then, names are abbreviated by omitting the quotes and the prefix.    Th
common  type  of name, in fact, consists of the prefix plus two more qua
giving the data set's name and type, respectively,  so  that  many  file
DSN's  that  correspond  exactly  to  the  canonical Kermit representati
filespec.  For instance, TEST.FORT is the source of  a  Fortran  program
TEST, and its fully qualified DSN would be '<userid>.TEST.FORT', where <
is the owner's logon ID.

While this description is complete as far as it goes,  it  omits  an  im
feature  that is widely used in organizing files under MVS and TSO, name
partitioned data set (PDS).  A PDS is a data set like any other, except
has  members,  each of which can usually be treated as a file in its own
In fact, with QSAM (the file access method employed by Kermit  and  many
applications),  only  members,  and  not the whole PDS, may be read or w
Thus, the term "file", as used in this chapter and the Kermit-370 chapte

notation for a PDS member consists of the member name enclosed  in  pare
and  appended  to the DSN (and the whole enclosed in quotes if the DSN i
qualified).  For example, if the Fortran program TEST were copied  into
called DEBUG.FORT, it would then be known as

    DEBUG.FORT(TEST)

Although the member name is written together with the DSN, it and the su
ing parentheses are not really part of the DSN and are not counted  towa
44-character  limit.   Still, a member name must conform to the rules fo
qualifier and, in addition, must not contain any hyphens.

All these properties of DSN's come into play when a file is being  recei

Kermit-TSO  creates  a  default DSN of "$.$".  The DSN is expanded to it
qualified form and then truncated at 44 characters, if need be.

The DSN prefix, which defaults to the user's logon ID, is similar to  a
specification on microcomputer systems: it selects an area of disk stora
it usually need not be specified.  In some ways, the prefix is also like
directory  designator,  since  the  file system structure is hierarchica
this reason, the Kermit concept of the "working directory" is  equated

qualified DSN is given).

the full DSN (or only the member name in the case of a PDS  member).
other  hand,  extra  information may be added by way of the SET FOREIGN
mand.

Kermit-TSO allows a group of files to be specified in a single filespec
cluding  the  special  "wildcard"  character  "*",  which matches any st
characters (even a null string) starting at a new DSN qualifier.   Only
may  be used in a filespec.  Also, the * may not be used for the member
a PDS (nor for any part of a PDS name).  Here are some examples:

  *.COBOL   All files of type COBOL (all COBOL source  files)  in  the
            working directory.

  BATCH*H.FORT
            All files in the current directory which begin with  the  qu
            BATCH   and  which  end  with  H.FORT.    This  would  not
            BATCH.FORT, however.

TSO files, like those in other IBM 370 systems, are  record-oriented  (s
introduction  to the Kermit-370 chapter).  In particular, TSO files are
terized by record format (RECFM), which may be fixed-length, varying-len
undefined-length;  by  maximum record length (LRECL); and by maximum blo
(BLKSIZE).  Fixed-length and varying-length may be (and, under  Kermit,
are)  combined  into  blocks, but undefined-length records may not.  Ind
convention, they have no logical record length,  only  a  maximum  block
Records  in TSO files may be up to 32760 bytes long, but varying-length
use four bytes to specify the length and have an effective limit of 3275

Another file system feature of occasional interest is the  means  of  re
errors.  When Kermit-TSO encounters a disk error, it attempts to prepare
planatory message for inclusion in the STATUS report.  The  primary  met
the standard SYNADAF macro.


1.2. Program Operation

At  startup time, Kermit-TSO looks for two initialization files, 'SYS1.K
and '<userid>.KERMINI' (where, as before, <userid> is  the  user's  logo
The  latter  file would also be known as just KERMINI.  The file 'SYS1.K
would be maintained by a systems programmer, but KERMINI would be mainta
the user.

Two parameters in the user's profile (the character delete and line dele
disabled during protocol mode (and restored afterwards) to prevent any c
in  case either of these characters has been defined to be printable.  T
tings in effect when Kermit starts up are saved as a sort  of  "normal"
snapshot  (as  opposed  to the "protocol" status just described).  The p
status is selected whenever Kermit enters protocol mode, and the normal
is  selected  when Kermit leaves protocol mode.  Note: if Kermit is inte
in the midst of a transfer or while in server mode, these  parameters  w
left with peculiar settings (namely, the protocol status), and they may
be restored by hand.

Although TSO does not allow an application program to take control of  t
synchronization  on  "TTY"  lines, the various full-screen emulation fro
are quite a different matter.  The standard IBM handshake (XON) is unnec
for  example,  with  a 7171 or 4994 because the front end itself turns t
around with essentially no delay in transparent mode.  Thus, handshaking
be suppressed for "SERIES1" devices (the micro Kermit should have HANDSH
OFF, and Kermit-TSO should have  HANDSHAKE  set  to  0).    Since  the
Kermit-370  default  handshake  (XON) is retained in Kermit-TSO, the sub
"SET HANDSHAKE 0" is a good candidate for inclusion the  KERMINI  file
user who habitually uses "SERIES1" lines.


Interactive Operation:

To  run Kermit-TSO interactively, invoke the program from TSO by typing
When you see the prompt,

    Kermit-TSO>

you may type a Kermit subcommand.  When the subcommand completes, Kermit
another  prompt.    The cycle repeats until you exit from the program.
ample:

    KERMIT

    Kermit-TSO Version 4.0 (88/1/31)
    Enter ? for a list of valid commands

    Kermit-TSO>send foo.*

      Files beginning with FOO are sent

    Kermit-TSO>receive test.spss

      File is received and called TEST.SPSS

    Kermit-TSO>exit


Command Line Invocation:

Kermit-TSO may also be invoked with command line arguments from TSO.   T
guments  are interpreted as a subcommand to be executed by Kermit after
tion of the initialization.  For instance:

    KERMIT send test.fort

Kermit will exit and return to TSO after completing the specified subcom


CLIST Operation:

Like other TSO programs, Kermit-TSO may be invoked from a CLIST.    Subc
can  be  passed to Kermit using the program input stack and/or command l
guments.  For example, to start up Kermit-TSO and have it act as a serve
clude the line:

    KERMIT server

To  pass  more  than one subcommand, they must be stacked in the order i
they are to be executed.  To start up a Kermit-TSO server with a three
ter CRC, create and stack a file with the following:

    set block 3
    server

and  then  invoke  Kermit.    Like  many  utility programs, Kermit-TSO u
GETLINE/PUTLINE service routines for terminal I/O,  and  the  nominally
active  subcommands can thus be supplied under program control.  Another
setting up multiple subcommands would be to collect the subcommands into
file  and  then  issue  the  TAKE  subcommand via the command line.  Of
CLIST's may be executed from Kermit, either directly or from a TAKE  fil
CLIST's  in turn may freely issue Kermit subcommands.  The subcommand KE
especially useful in this context for distinguishing  Kermit  subcommand
TSO commands.


Server mode:

Command  execution  in server mode is different in several respects from
operation.  First of all, some Kermit subcommands are not allowed (see t
of  subcommands  in  the  Kermit-370 chapter).  Moreover, command errors
terminate any active TAKE file.  Also, commands run in  a  special  envi
with  the User Profile temporarily modified.  Another difference is that
intercepts terminal I/O as much as possible and transmits the data to th
Kermit as text packets.  The problem with this redirection is that some
commands issue terminal I/O directly, so that some messages never appear
local Kermit (except, perhaps, as bad packets).


1.3. Kermit-TSO Subcommands

Kermit-TSO  supports all the subcommands described in the corresponding
of the Kermit-370 chapter.  In addition, there is the  system-specific
mand  TSO, which is just a synonym for the generic HOST subcommand.  TSO
issued as a remote Kermit command when Kermit-TSO is in server mode.  Al
END subcommand is available as a synonym for EXIT and QUIT.

The remainder of this section concentrates on the subcommands that have
form or meaning for Kermit-TSO.  See also the chapter on Kermit-370 for
details.


                              THE SEND SUBCOMMAND

Syntax: SEND filespec Öforeign-filespec×

The SEND subcommand causes a file or file group to be sent from TSO to t
mit on the other system.  DSN prefixing is done on the filespec  in  the
way (see also the CWD subcommand).

filespec  may contain a wildcard "*".  If it does, then all matching fil
be sent, up to 711 files in all.

The foreign-filespec, if any, is used for the file header of the outgoin
replacing  the  usual  name.type  derived from the MVS/TSO filespec.  No
this form of the SEND subcommand is used only  for  single  files  becau
foreign-filespec  is  used only for the first file of a group (subsequen
having default headers).

Although the file transfer cannot be cancelled from the TSO side, Kermit
capable of responding to "cancel file" or "cancel batch" signals from th
Kermit; these are typically entered by typing Control-X or  Control-Z,
tively.


                            THE RECEIVE SUBCOMMAND

Syntax: RECEIVE Öfilespec×

The  RECEIVE  subcommand  tells Kermit to receive a file or file group f
other system.  You should then issue a SEND subcommand to the other Kerm

A filespec in the subcommand indicates what name the incoming  file  sho
given.  Wildcards may not be used.  If the filespec is invalid, Kermit-T
suppress the transfer.  If the optional filespec is omitted (and, in any
for  all  files  after  the  first  in a group) Kermit-TSO will use the
provided by the other Kermit.  If a name is not a legal  DSN,  Kermit-TS
delete  excess characters, change illegal characters to pound signs, and
to create a legal name.

When the record format is "F", any received  record  longer  than  the
record  length  (LRECL)  will be truncated, and shorter records will be

mands.

If an error occurs during the file  transfer,  as  much  of  the  file
received  is  saved on disk.  If the sending of a file is cancelled by t
of the foreign system, Kermit-TSO will discard whatever had arrived, unl
PEND is ON or INCOMPLETE is KEEP.

If  the  incoming file has the same name as an existing file (either a d
or a PDS member), and WARNING is OFF, the original file  will  be  overw
If WARNING is set ON, however, Kermit-TSO will protect the existing file
of two ways.  If the filespec was entered  with  the  subcommand,  Kermi
prompt  the  user  for  permission to overwrite the file.  If the filesp
from the foreign Kermit, Kermit-TSO will change the incoming name so as
obliterate the pre-existing file.  It attempts to find a unique name by
sively modifying the original and checking for the existence of such a f
each  step.  The procedure operates on the second qualifier of the full
the member name in the case of a PDS member) and begins  by  truncating
seven  characters,  if necessary, and then appends "0".  If a file by th
exists, Kermit then replaces the "0" with a "1".  It continues in  this
up to "9", and if an unused name cannot be found, the transfer fails.


                              THE SET SUBCOMMAND

Syntax: SET parameter Övalue×

The  SET subcommand establishes or modifies various parameters controlli
transfers.  The following SET parameters are available in Kermit-TSO,  b
in Kermit-370 in general:
FILE
  BLKSIZE           Block size for incoming file.
  LRECL             Logical Record length for incoming file.
  RECFM             Record format for incoming files.
  SPACE             Allocation unit (in tracks) for incoming files.
  UNIT              Device type for incoming files.
  VOLUME            Disk pack for incoming files.
PREFIX              Default disk area.
TIMER               Determine whether Kermit-TSO should time out.


SET FILE BLKSIZE

Syntax: SET FILE BLKSIZE number

This  sets  the  block size for incoming files to a number from 1 to 327
the case of fixed-format files, this number is just an upper bound; the
block  size  is  taken  to  be the largest multiple of the LRECL which d
exceed this limit.  The default is 6233.


SET FILE LRECL

Syntax: SET FILE LRECL number

This sets the effective logical record length for incoming files  to  a
from 1 to 32756.  This parameter is not used for files of undefined reco
mat.  Moreover, it is not exactly the same as the MVS/TSO LRECL, which i
more  than  the  actual  maximum  data  length for varying-length record
default is 80.


SET FILE RECFM

Syntax: SET FILE RECFM option

This sets the record format to use for  incoming  files.    Valid  optio
"Fixed",  "Varying"  (the  default),  and  "Undefined".  This parameter
limited to a subset of the range of possibilities for the MVS/TSO  RECFM
Kermit-TSO,  all  incoming  files  of fixed or varying format are automa
blocked according to the current block size.  Fixed-format records  are
or truncated, as needed, to the current LRECL.


SET FILE SPACE

Syntax: SET FILE SPACE number

This  sets  the  track allocation unit for incoming files to a number fr
32760.  The default is 5.  Since data sets are allowed as many as  15  e
this default provides for files up to 75 tracks.


SET FILE UNIT

Syntax: SET FILE UNIT type

This  sets  the  device  type  or  group for incoming files.  Valid opti
installation-dependent.  The default is SYSDA, which is universally  ava
but  not necessarily desirable, since many installations restrict TSO da
to a particular set of disk volumes.  In such cases, there is  usually
name  which  refers  only  to  those  TSO  volumes,  and  the  global IN
'SYS1.KERMINI' should set the file unit parameter to that name.


SET FILE VOLUME

Syntax: SET FILE VOLUME name

This  sets  the  disk  volume  for  incoming   files.      Valid   names
installation-dependent,  but  are,  in  any case, no more than six alpha
characters.  The default is blank (none); in that case, the system choos
of the available volumes of the specified UNIT type.


SET PREFIX

Syntax: SET PREFIX Östring×

This subcommand is equivalent to the CWD subcommand (q.v.).


SET TIMER

Syntax: SET TIMER ON or OFF

This specifies whether Kermit-TSO is to maintain a timer for each packet
pects to read.  The default is ON.  If the timer is enabled,  its  durat
set  by the SET SEND TIMEOUT subcommand initially and then set according
request of the other Kermit.


                              THE CWD SUBCOMMAND

Syntax: CWD Östring or PDSname()×

The CWD (Change Working Directory) subcommand establishes  a  new  defau
prefix  or turns prefixing off.  This facility is similar to, but not qu
same as, the prefix defined in the User Profile.   The  string,  if  spe
must  consist  of  one or more DSN qualifiers, and the first must alread
index in the disk catalog.  Subsequent file transfers take place  to  an
the  corresponding  disk  area  whenever a fully qualified DSN (one encl
quotes) is not given.  The initial prefix is the user's  logon  ID,  i.e
same  as the default prefix in the User Profile.  If no prefix is given
subcommand, then prefixing is no longer performed.  The user must be car
remember  the  distinction  between  the prefix defined for Kermit and t
TSO.  Pure Kermit subcommands (like SEND and TAKE) always use the  forme
TSO commands (and the TSO-related subcommand TYPE) use the latter.

An  alternative  form  of  the  CWD  subcommand allows specifying the fu
unquoted) name of a PDS followed by paired parentheses.  When such  a  "
directory"  is  in use, a filespec other than a fully qualified DSN is t
be a member name within the PDS.  For that reason, this  form  should  b
cautiously,  since the Kermit-TSO log filespecs (such as KER.LOG and KER
would be treated the same way.  In particular, it is advisable to turn o
mode  only  when  the Kermit prefix is a partially qualified DSN (once s
the log continues to the same data  set  regardless  of  what  happens
prefix).


                           THE DIRECTORY SUBCOMMAND

Syntax: DIRECTORY Öfilespec×

The  DIRECTORY  subcommand  uses the TSO LISTCAT command to display part
data set catalog, i.e., all data sets whose names begin with the qualifi
the Kermit prefix (if any) concatenated with the given filespec (if any)


                              THE TSO SUBCOMMAND

Syntax: TSO text of command

Although  Kermit-TSO does not have a full set of its own subcommands for
ing TSO files, it provides those services through the operating  system.
can  issue  any  TSO command, e.g., to list, type, rename or delete file
messages, and so on.  The TSO subcommand under Kermit is  synonymous  wi
HOST subcommand.


1.4. How to build an executable version of Kermit-TSO

Before  attempting  to  build Kermit-TSO, look in the Kermit distributio
both IK0KER and IKTKER for an installation document, as well as "beware"
and  update files, and read them first.  They will probably contain info
that is more current than what you see here.

Kermit-TSO consists at present of a large assembly (KERMIT.ASM, containi
Kermit  program)  and  a small one (DYNALC.ASM, containing a subroutine
locating data sets).  Although DYNALC is a single file in the Kermit  di
tion,  the  source  for  Kermit  itself  is  in  many  pieces, some gene
Kermit-370 and some specific to TSO.  All the necessary pieces are seque
columns  73-80 so that the numbers form a strictly increasing sequence w
pieces are correctly "pasted" together.    It  is  important  to  preser
original  sequence  numbers  so  that  updates,  if  any, can be applied
source.

To create a runnable version:

   1. Combine the following "ASM" files from the Kermit distribution  in
      a  single file with RECFM=F(B) and LRECL=80: IK0DOC, IK0MAC, IKTMA
      IK0DEF, IK0MAI, IK0CMD, IK0COM, IKTUTL, and IK0PRO.   The  resulti
      file  is  the  composite  source  for Kermit-TSO, called KERMIT.AS
      This source must retain the original  sequence  numbers  in  colum
      73-80 (in other words, be sure not to resequence the source accide
      tally by using the editor!)

   2. Copy or rename IKTDYN.ASM from the Kermit  distribution  to  a  fi
      called DYNALC.ASM with RECFM=F(B) and LRECL=80.

   3. Assemble the source file(s).

   4. Create  the  executable load module KERMIT using the linkage edito
      Kermit is designed to run as a command processor, and so it must
      placed  in  SYS1.CMDLIB or in a PDS concatenated to SYS1.CMDLIB (f
      example, via the STEPLIB command).

   5. If your site's ASCII/EBCDIC translation table for TTY lines does n
      conform to the one listed in the appendix (which in turn conforms
      the one given in the IBM System/370 Reference Summary),  then  ent
      the   appropriate   SET   ATOE/ETOA/TATOE/TETOA   subcommands   in
      'SYS1.KERMINI'.  NOTE: If the ASCII/EBCDIC translation is not inve
      tible, Kermit will not and cannot work.

In order to verify the operation of a new version of Kermit-TSO, you may
under TEST using the CP parameter.


1.5. What's New

Below is a list of the more important features in  Version  4.0  of  Ker
added  since  the  release  of  TSO/3708 in May 1987.  Since Version 4.0
first release of Kermit-370 for TSO, some of the "new"  features  are  a
new only to the Columbia TSO distribution.

   1. Suppression of LINE and CHAR delete functions during protocol mode

   2. Advanced  server  functions  and  subcommands for talking to anoth
      Kermit running in server mode.

   3. Long packet protocol.

   4. TYPE, ECHO,  XTYPE,  and  XECHO  subcommands  (the  last  two  bei
      Series/1 analogs of the first two.)

   5. REMOTE  KERMIT  commands honored by TSO server, including SET, SHO
      TAKE, TDUMP, STATUS, HOST, TSO, CWD, DIR, and TYPE.

   6. TEST mode for debugging.

   7. Multi-column, two-level, selective SHOW display.

   8. Send and acknowledge attribute packets.

   9. Optionally append to, rather than replace, old data sets with dupl
      cate names.

  10. Automatic detection of terminal controller type (TTY or SERIES1).

  11. SYNADAF message in cases of disk I/O error.


1.6. What's Missing

Work  on  Kermit-TSO will continue.  Features that need to be improved o
include:

   - Detect file properties from Attribute packets  and  allow  overridi
     current parameter settings.  Also implement file archiving.

   - Add a SET REPEAT subcommand.

   - Finish  SET  LINE,  so that Kermit-TSO can be used as a local Kermi
     connecting to a remote host over  an  alternate  communication  por
     Add a CONNECT subcommand.

   - Compute file size for outgoing A-packets and implement the SPACE su
     command.

   - Reject files known (via  A-packets)  to  be  too  big  for  availab
     storage.

   - Intercept all terminal output during protocol mode.

   - Allow wildcard notation for PDS members.
