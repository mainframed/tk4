Kermit-370 4.0 "Beware File" - Known Bugs, Problems, Limitations.

As of: Tue Dec  6 10:16:53 1988

Kermit-370  uses ASCII/EBCDIC  translation  tables which conform  to the
ones  given  in the IBM System/370  Reference  Summary.   If your site's
translation tables do not conform to the one Kermit uses, then enter the
appropriate  SET ATOE/ETOA/TATOE/TETOA  commands  in the system  KERMINI
file.  Your system's ASCII/EBCDIC  translation tables need not be mutual
inverses, but if either table is not invertible at all, then Kermit will
not and cannot work unless you change your system's table.

When Kermit-370  is to be used with a 7171, make sure the 7171 is set up
with its "keyboard lock delay" set to 0.  Otherwise, the "terminal" will
hang whenever  Kermit-370 clears the screen.   This happens consistently
when  the  parameter  is set to 10, and not at all  when  set to 0.  For
numbers in between, the higher the number, the more it happens.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is a problem  with using the SET PROMPT subcommand  in a TAKE file
-- it takes  as its argument  the remainder  of the input  line from the
TAKE file.  In other words, SET PROMPT should  not be used in TAKE files
with fixed-length  records unless you are willing  to right-justify  the
prompt string in the record.

A blank after SET TABS ON is also significant because there is an option
of putting  a list of tab columns  after  the 'ON'.   The warning  about
RECFM F for TAKE files applies here as well as for SET PROMPT.

----> The fix: SC88006.   Trailing  blanks  are trimmed  off the command
lines read from TAKE files.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 4.0 inadvertantly omitted the SHOW ALL subcommand.   Typing just
SHOW gets the same effect, however.

----> The fix: SC88028.  SHOW ALL is re-implemented.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 4.0 required a syntax for the SEND and GET subcommands with both
the mainframe and foreign filespecs on one line.  There was no option of
entering just "SEND" and being prompted for the filespecs.

----> The fix: SC88035.  A new syntax is implemented.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 4.0 failed  to turn off the  "protocol mode active" flag after a
transfer.  No harmful effects accrued, but the terminal would seem to be
hung after trying to SEND a  non-existent file from command mode *after*
a successful transfer.

----> The fix: SC88035.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
When the file  TYPE was set to TEXT,  release  4.0 would  trim  trailing
blanks from each record before sending it, whether  fixed-length  or not
(there seems to be a consensus that varying-length records should not be
trimmed).

----> The fix: SC88050.  Varying-length records are not trimmed.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
For a file  very  close  in size  to the amount  of free storage  on the
target  system,  the  exchange  of attribute  packets  might  cause  the
receiving Kermit to conclude incorrectly  that the file would not fit in
storage and, therefore,  to reject the transfer.   It might, in fact, be
impossible  to transfer  such a file without  increasing  the amount  of
storage.   It is now possible  to issue a subcommand  to Kermit-370 (SET
ATTRIB OFF) to suppress the exchange of attribute packets.  This feature
is implemented in SC88071.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kermit-370 now has the feature of leaving protocol mode upon receiving a
"packet" that consists of nothing  but the word STOP.   This  feature is
implemented in SC88074.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kermit-370, in talking  to another Kermit in server mode, would complain
if a "long reply"  to a server command  began with an X-packet,  even if
the current block check type was 1.  Mutually  setting the check to 2 or
3 would, of course, force the other Kermit to begin long replies with an
S-packet.

----> The fix: SC88074.   Kermit-370 accepts long replies beginning with
an X-packet.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kermit-370 would not treat a NAK for packet n+1 as an ACK for packet  n.
Instead,  it would retransmit  packet  n until and unless  the receiving
Kermit sent an explicit ACK.

----> The fix: SC88092.  Kermit-370 now treats NAK(n+1) as ACK(n).
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kermit-370  now allows TAKE files with imbedded  sequence numbers.  This
feature is implemented in SC88101.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kermit-370  originally  offered  no choice  about how to treat lines too
long for the established  LRECL of an uploaded  file.   The new SET FILE
LONGLINE subcommand  allows a choice of folding or truncating the lines,
or halting the transfer.  The fix: SC88120.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kermit  operation  is possible  through  a 3708,  but only with a rather
specific configuration.  First, the terminal line must be set for either
"protocol  enveloping"  or "dynamic"  mode.  In the former,  the port is
permanently  set for line-at-a-time  operation,  but the latter  permits
(requires)  the user to specify a mode at logon time.  In any event, the
whole session must be conducted  in line mode for Kermit to work.  Other
important  details of the terminal  configuration  are: (1) the terminal
must be specified  as a TWX device,  (2) the line must be set for 8 data
bits and 1 stop bit, (3) there should  be no "read prompt",  and (4) the
so-called "alternate"  translation  table (number 3) should be selected.
Kermit-370  must also be configured  because the normal packet character
SOH (code 1, ctrl-A)  is not passed by the 3708.  A suitable  substitute
is VT (code  9, ctrl-I).

The requirement that a whole session must be set for protocol enveloping
is obviously  not ideal,  but it seems  to be inescapable.   It has been
rumored  that REAL support for a 3708 is possible,  but the details have
not been forthcoming.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Kermit-370 has been reported or rumored to work with CONTROLLER set to:
TTY      - IBM 3705, IBM 3725, Comten, IBM 3708.
SERIES1  - Yale ASCII system on IBM Series/1 or IBM 4994, IBM 7171, IBM
           937x ASCII subsystem, Hydra II.
GRAPHICS - Datastream/Leedata 8010 or 8030 or 874, Micom 7400, PCI 1076
           or 276, Renex TMS-1, KMW.
FULLSCR  - (same as TTY, so far)

Failure has been reported for SIM3278 and for Adacom.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
As for SIM3278,  the latest  word (as of September  of 1987) was that it
still doesn't support transparent  WRITE/READ, but it will someday soon.
Until it does, it obviously can't support Kermit.

Just recently I was handed the installation tape for SIM3278/VM, Version
To check transparency I brought up the module on the tape in a test virt
machine and found that it did not work correctly using CMS Kermit 4.0 an
MS-DOS Kermit 2.31.  I have not had time to investigate.  However, for e
one's edification I am appending an extract from the installation guide.
SIM3278/VM is marketed by SIMWARE, Inc., 20 Colonnade Road, Ottawa, Onta
Canada  K2E 7M6.  Their telephone number is (613)727-1779.

     APPENDIX C. DATA TRANSPARENCY
     _____________________________

     You may wish to  use  data  transparency  for  one  of  the  follow
     reasons:

     .   To send non-protocol converted data to an ASCII terminal.

     .   Your terminal may permit incoming data to go directly to a prin
         port, or your terminal may have graphic capabilities which requ
         special ASCII control codes to draw complex screen images.

> Note that both of these are purely for downloading.  No mention is mad
> of uploading anything!

     In  either  case,  the  SIM3278/VM conversion software must not tam
     with the ASCII data.  A signal can be used  to  inform  SIM3278/VM
     leave  the  data "as is", and let it pass transparently through to
     terminal or PC.

     SIM3278/VM uses a special 3270 screen address sequence to  invoke
     data  transparency mode of operation.  All data following this spec
     screen address will be routed directly through to  the  output  dev
     without  going  through the 3270 to ASCII protocol conversion proce
     This feature is  useful  for  downloading  special  control  codes
     functions  to  program  function  (PF)  keys  or  softkeys.   Altho
     SIM3278/VM  performs   optional   downloading   of   softkeys   dur
     connection,  the  data  transparency  feature allows softkey or PF
     loading anytime during the  SIM3278/VM  session.    Information  ab
     downloading softkeys is contained in Appendix D of this manual.

     Simware   has   chosen   to   be   compatible  with  a  suggested
     implementation of data transparency as defined for  the  IBM  Serie
     YALE  IUP  emulation  system.    The IBM/YALE system defines a spec
     screen address sequence which is impossible to  use  on  a  real  3
     terminal,  but  is  easily  detectable  by  a  3270  emulation syst
     including SIM3278/VM.

     Your own module may be created using VM/CMS  software  such  as  IB
     DMS/CMS  product,  or,  you  could  write  your own assembler langu
     program using the documented IBM 3270 interface called DIAGNOSE  X'
     (see the VM/SP System Programmer's Guide for more information).

     The special screen address sequence must precede the transparent da
     so  that SIM3278/VM will not interfere with it as it passes through
     the terminal or PC.   The special  screen  address  is  the  six  b
     hexadecimal string X'115D7F110000'.

> Note that both of these are purely for downloading.  No mention is mad
> of uploading anything!

                                          The last three bytes are actua
     the "impossible" screen address (the IBM/YALE sequence).

> Note that this is the string defined in the Yale ASCII system for Writ
> only, not Write/Read.
                                                               If you wr
     your  own  program,  it will have to issue a fullscreen output comm
     with a buffer that begins the 3270  opcode  (for  example,  WRITE,
     ERASE  WRITE),  a  Write Control Character (WCC), and the special d
     transparency sequence, followed by the transparent data itself.


     Appendix C. Data Transparency


     An example of the command might be:

       opcode  WCC  X'115D7F110000'  special-data
        ...... which in assembler language might be ......
       BUFFER DC X'F1',X'C2',X'115D7F110000',X'0227ADF7950E27ADF18303'

     All transparent data or groups of data containing transparency sent
     the host must be preceded by the special data  transparency  sequen
     SIM3278/VM  returns  to normal mode upon completion of transmission
     the datastream; therefore, data transparency only applies to a  sin
     buffer of data.

     Note  that  SIM3278/VM will perform EBCDIC-to-ASCII translation on
     data in the file.  This translation to ASCII is the only  modificat
     of the data done by SIM3278/VM.

> This is specifically INcompatible with the Yale ASCII implementation.
> Say it ain't so!  (Note that there are no examples in the text of what
> comes out to the terminal).  If this is true, then all the Series/1-ty
> transparent utilities, including Kermit and Yale's TPRINT will fail
> when going through SIM3270.
                                      It is useful to note that the spec
     screen address transparency sequence is not passed on to the termin

     In  the  case  where  a  printer  is  attached,  the  terminal perm
     "print-through" by means of some type of Escape or Control code, so
     code  that  turns the terminal's printer port on must be supplied.
     EXEC called SIMPRINT can now be used to transfer host data files  o
     a PC-attached printer or plotter.

     The  following  represents  the  contents  of a sample data file to
     transmitted to a PC-attached printer:

       X'F1C3115D7F110000'      (begin-transparency sequence)
       X'27C3AD03'          (a sample print-through sequence)
        ...data for the attached printer...

     A screen CLEAR (pressing Clear or the assigned key sequence) should
     issued following a transparent screen write.  SIM3278/VM assumes  t
     the  data sent to the ASCII line is going to a terminal.  The state
     the virtual screen is somewhat unpredictable once transparent mode
     entered, and may vary from terminal to terminal.
