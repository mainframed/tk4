* This program is the IBM 370 side of a file transfer system.  It
* can be used to transfer files between a micro and a system running
* under various operating systems.  See the KERMIT User's Guide
* and Protocol manual for the complete program specifications.
*
* All assembly-language Kermits for IBM 370's are derivatives of
* Kermit-CMS 1.00, although some (including the current version) have
* passed through more-or-less complete rewriting.  The following is a
* summary of the versions leading to the present one, which is actually
* a generic family of Kermits with specific members for various
* operating systems.

*
* Version 3.2 (Dec 86)
*    Extensive revisions from version 3.1 - separation into generic
*    and system-specific sections.  New features: D-binary file type,
*    DIR command, give number of files sent in STATUS report, TDUMP
*    NAMES command to report names of files sent, give throughput
*    statistics in STATUS report, support REMOTE COPY and RENAME to
*    micro server, optional implied system commands, binary file record
*    padded with 0 (not blank), add file date to A-packets, reject file
*    if A-pkt says it's too big, display reason for A-pkt rejection in
*    STATUS report, SET PARITY to allow 8-bit data through S/1, allow
*    debug log of raw data, allow setting initial retry limit,
*    allow SET 8-BIT-QUOTE, use input case for XECHO + foreign files,
*    implement separate terminal anti-translation (TATOE/TETOA),
*    GIVE command to save translation table to disk as a TAKE file,
*    interface to allow Kermit subcommand execution from CMS EXEC's,
*    left and right margins for SEND,
*    SET PROMPT, SET MARGIN, SET HANDSHAKE, no page break in buffers,
*    automatic length-tuning of long packets.
*    Settable tab stops - S. Blankinship
*    Fix to allow long packets through 7171 VTAM - R. Bolch
*
* Version 3.1 (Jul 86)
*    Extensive revisions from version 3.0 - including new SET/SHOW;
*    non-delimited V binary transmission; Generic, CP/CMS, and Kermit
*    commands in Server mode; packet padding; capability mask;
*    A-packets with file size, system tag, F/V, and Text/Bin;
*    SPACE cmd; SET/SHOW: APPEND,DESTINATION,DELAY,RETRY,SEARCH-ALL;
*    symbolic error numbers; 'Discard' indicator on Z-packet;
*    optional remote file name for SEND + micro GET; optional echo and
*    halt-on-error for TAKE files; default ft=TAKE for TAKE command;
*    commands to micro Server; selective or universal SHOW;
*    non-zero return codes for error conditions.
*    XTYPE/XECHO commands - C. Frazier at Harvard Bus. Sch.
*    Long packet protocol - R. Bolch at Triangle
*
* Version 3.0
*    Almost a full rewrite.
*

*    Add a SLEEP command after server/receive mode greetings.
*    Fix Logout hanging in Series1 mode - P. DiCamillio.
*    Hand-code HNDINT to allow non-009 console - B. Verser, D. Elbon
*    Add SET EOF ON/OFF command to truncate file at ^Z.
*    Add SET TABS-EXPAND ON/OFF command to expand tabs in TEXT.
*    Do not change MAXOUT if not BINARY - Greg Small.
*    Blk-3 chksum calculation begins at pkt len field - G. Small
*    Initial setting of status: no file tranfer yet - G. Small
*    Use max packet size of 60 for 7171 - P. Di Camillio
*    SHOW command defaults to SHOW ALL
*
* Version 2.01 (May 85)
*    If virtual console is not a TTY, assume 3270.
*
* Version 2.0
* Sep 83: 8-bit quoting to allow binary file transfer.
* Sep 83: Don't restrict disk lrecl to 256.
* Aug 84: Pack as much data into a packet as possible.
* Aug 84: Use common routines SPAR and RPAR for init packets.
* Sep 84: Add repeat count prefixing.
* Sep 84: Add support for two char checksum and three char CRC.
