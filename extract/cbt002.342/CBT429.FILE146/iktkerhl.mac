)F FUNCTION -

  The KERMIT command invokes Kermit-TSO, an assembly language program
which implements the Kermit file transfer protocol on IBM System/370
and XA mainframe computers and compatibles running the MVS (Multiple
Virtual Storage) operating system with the TSO (Time Sharing Option)
subsystem.  Kermit-TSO supports file transfer in both line-mode and
full-screen operation.

  Line-mode supports asynchronous  half-duplex ASCII communications
through 3705/3725 or equivalent front ends, while full-screen supports
asynchronous full-duplex ASCII communications through the IBM Series/1
running the Yale ASCII Communications System (or equivalent) or various
other converters with graphics throughput option. See the SET CONTROLLER
subcommand for further details.

)X SYNTAX -
         KERMIT

   Required - None
   Defaults - None
   Note     - The Kermit "?" help feature is available when entering
              Kermit-TSO subcommands.  A subcommand followed by a space
              and a question mark and entered with a carriage return
              will display a brief description of what is expected or
              possible at that point.

            - When connecting in line-mode, several flags must first be
              set on the local Kermit.  The following are the defaults
              and other possibilities for those values:

              Baud             whatever the site supports
              Data bits        7
              Flow-control     None
              Handshake        XON | None
              Local-echo       on (half-duplex)
              Parity           even | mark | odd

            - When connecting in full-screen, several flags must first
              be set on the local Kermit.  The following are the
              defaults and other possibilities for those values:

              Baud             whatever the site supports
              Data bits        7 | 8
              Flow-control     XON/XOFF | None
              Handshake        None
              Local-echo       off (full-duplex)
              Parity           even | mark | odd | none

            - When sending files to Kermit-TSO, any record longer than
              the logical record length (LRECL) will be truncated to
              that value.  If the record format is fixed (RECFM=F), any
              shorter records will be padded to LRECL.  If the record
              format is variable or undefined (RECFM=V or RECFM=U), the
              block length can be as high as 32760, provided the disk
              device tracksize is not exceeded.

            - When sending files to Kermit-TSO, the local Kermit must
              use a carriage return as the end-of-line (EOL) character.

            - This version of Kermit-TSO does not support timeouts for
              other than line-mode terminals.  Therefore, the user
              should press the carriage return key on the microcomputer
              after long periods of update inactivity during file
              transfer, or rely on the timeout facility of the local
              Kermit, if supported, to avoid indefinite delays.

=RECEIVE=RECEIV=RECEI=RECE=REC
)F FUNCTION -
           Initiates file transfer to Kermit-TSO from the local Kermit.

           - If the optional 'dataset-name' is not specified,
             Kermit-TSO will use the name(s) provided by the local
             Kermit.  If no dataset exists with this name, one will
             be created using the file attribute and space values in
             effect when the RECEIVE subcommand was entered.
           - If the 'dataset-name' specified is the same as an existing
             dataset, Kermit-TSO will prompt the user for the option to
             overwrite the dataset.
           - If the 'dataset-name' was not specified, but is the same
             as an existing dataset,  Kermit-TSO will overwrite the
             dataset if the WARNING parameter has been set to OFF, but
             will attempt to create a new, unique name if WARNING is ON.

)X SYNTAX -

=SEND=SEN
)F FUNCTION -
           Initiates file transfer from Kermit-TSO to the local Kermit.

           - One wildcard "*" may be used anywhere in the 'dataset-name'
             to stand for a string of zero or more qualifiers, but no
             wildcard is allowed in specifying a PDS member name.
           - If the parameters are not specified, Kermit-TSO will
             prompt for them.
           - The 'dataset-name' must be cataloged.

)X SYNTAX -

))FOREIGN-FILESPEC - The name the file is to have on the other system.

=SERVER=SERVE=SERV=SER
)F FUNCTION -
           Invokes Kermit-TSO server mode.

           - Once Kermit-TSO enters server mode, it only accepts
             subcommands entered at the local Kermit until a FINISH
             command is executed.  Any non-default parameters must be
             SET before invoking this mode if the local Kermit does
             not offer the REMOTE KERMIT function.
           - The local Kermit must support server subcommands to
             communicate with Kermit-TSO in this mode.  The basic
             server subcommands Kermit-TSO supports are as follows:

             SEND   - Send a file to Kermit-TSO;
             GET    - Get a file from Kermit-TSO;
             FINISH - Terminate server mode and return to the
                      Kermit-TSO prompt;
             BYE    - Terminate server mode, exit Kermit-TSO and
                      logoff TSO.

           - Kermit-TSO also offers advanced server functions, including
             the various REMOTE file manipulations, TSO commands, and
             Kermit subcommands.

         SET 'parameter' 'value'

   Note: Many of the parameters are multi-level, as in SET FILE RECFM F.
         The following list of operands includes all levels.

   Required - 'parameter' 'value'
   Defaults - None

)O OPERANDS -
))APPEND 'ON | OFF' -
                   Tells whether to append an incoming file to an
                   existing dataset of the same name.  The default is
                   OFF.  Note: there is no provision for appending to
                   PDS members.

))ATOE 'num1' 'num2' - Modifies the ASCII-to-EBCDIC translate table
                       used by Kermit-TSO.  The table begins as the
                       Kermit standard translate table (defined in
                       the Kermit protocol specifications).  If the
                       numeric values are omitted, the whole table is
                       restored to its initial contents.  Tables ETOA,
                       TATOE, and TETOA may be modified in the same way.
       'num1' - A decimal number 0-255 for the value of the ASCII
                character, i.e., the table offset.
       'num2' - A decimal number 0-255 for the corresponding EBCDIC
                character.

))BLKSIZE 'number' - With FILE: specifies the block size for datasets
                     created by Kermit-TSO.  Maximum is 32760.  The
                     default is 6233.

))BLOCK '1 | 2 | 3' - Specifies the type of block check used during
                      file transfer.  The default is 1.
                      '1' - A one character checksum.
                      '2' - A two character checksum.
                      '3' - A three character CRC.

))CONTROLLER 'TTY | SERIES1 | GRAPHICS' -
                   Kermit-TSO automatically determines whether you are
                   connected via a Series/1-style emulation controller
                   or a TTY line.  This command is provided, though, so
                   you can change connections and because Kermit may not
                   be able to distinguish between Series/1 and graphics
                   throughput devices.  For both of those, Kermit
                   attempts to disable the 3270 protocol conversion
                   function by putting the controller into "transparent
                   mode"; this allows Kermit packets to pass through
                   intact.

))DEBUG 'ON | OFF | RAW' - If ON, keep a journal of all packets sent
                     and received in the file KER.LOG.  If OFF, stop
                     logging the packets and close the file.  Default
                     is OFF.  If RAW, record packets exactly as sent
                     and received, rather than in EBCDIC.

              Note:  KER.LOG is prefixed with the Kermit, rather than
                     the TSO, prefix when debug mode is entered.  The
                     log dataset thus created continues in use no
                     matter what happens to the Kermit prefix.

              Note:  Packets sent by Kermit-TSO are distinguished by
                     a carriage return (X'0D') at the end; packets
                     received have had it stripped by the front end
                     (TTY) processor.

))DELAY 'number' - Specifies the number of seconds Kermit-TSO will
                   delay before beginning to send packets after the
                   SEND subcommand has been entered.  Default is 10.
                   Use a DELAY of 1 to abbreviate the usual greetings
                   written on the screen at the start of protocol mode
                   or a DELAY of 0 to suppress the greetings entirely
                   (along with the attendant one-second pause).

))ECHO 'ON | OFF' - With TAKE:
                   Controls whether the contents of TAKE command files
                   are echoed during execution.

))END-OF-LINE 'number' - With SEND or RECEIVE:
                 Specifies the decimal value of the ASCII character
                 used for the packet-terminator or end-of-line. The
                 'number' must be 0-31.  The default is carriage return
                 (13).

))EOF 'ON | OFF' - ON means incoming text files are to be cut off at
                   first Ctrl-Z character within the data, OFF means
                   accept incoming text files in their entirety.

))ERROR-ACTION 'CONTINUE | HALT' - With TAKE:
                   Controls whether an error occuring during execution
                   of a TAKE command file is fatal to the execution of
                   that file.

))ETOA 'num1' 'num2' - Modifies the EBCDIC-to-ASCII translate table
                       used by Kermit-TSO.  See the description under
                       ATOE.

))FILE - Takes subparameters BLKSIZE, LRECL, RECFM, SPACE, TYPE, UNIT,
         and VOLUME.

))FOREIGN - Takes subparameters PREFIX and SUFFIX.

))INITIAL 'num' - With RETRY:
                   Establishes the limit for retrying the first packet
                   in a transfer.  The default is 16.

))LEFT 'column' - With MARGIN: sets the left margin for restricting the
                  width of files to be sent. A value of zero disables
                  the left margin.

))LRECL 'number' - With FILE: Specifies the logical record length for
                   incoming datasets.  The 'number' must be from 1 to
                   32756 (32K) decimal.  Default is 80.

             Note: The Kermit LRECL applies only to data bytes.  The
                   MVS/TSO LRECL for varying-format files will be four
                   larger to accommodate the record-descriptor words.

))MARGIN - Takes subparameters LEFT and RIGHT.

))PACKET 'num' - With RETRY:
                   Establishes the limit for retrying a packet in a
                   transfer.  The default is 5.

))PACKET-SIZE 'num' - With RECEIVE:
                   Use the specified "num" as the maximum length for
                   incoming packets. The valid range is 26-9024, and
                   80 is the default.  SET RECEIVE PACKET-SIZE 95 or
                   greater causes Kermit-TSO to negotiate reception of
                   extended length packets with other Kermit programs
                   that support this option.

))PAD-CHAR 'num' - With SEND or RECEIVE:
                   Padding character to use between packets, NUL (ASCII
                   0) by default.

))PADDING 'num' - With SEND or RECEIVE:
                   Number  of copies  of the  interpacket  padding
                   character, zero by default.

))PARITY 'MARK | NONE' -
                   Transparent-mode ASCII data from a SERIES1 or
                   GRAPHICS device will typically have either all Mark
                   parity (seven data bits with the eighth bit set) or
                   no parity (eight data bits).  Kermit-TSO must know
                   which kind of parity to expect in order to calculate
                   checksums properly.

))PROMPT 'string' -
                   This command defines the character  string that
                   Kermit-TSO displays when asking for a command. The
                   prompt may be any string of up to 20 characters. The
                   default is "Kermit-TSO>".

))QUOTE 'char' - With SEND or RECEIVE:
                 Control character quoting prefix, normally #.
                 This character must have an ASCII value in the
                 range 33-62 or 96-126.
          Note:  Do not change this parameter unless transferring
                 a long file which contains many '#' characters.

                  disables the right margin.

))SPACE 'number' - With FILE: Specifies the number of tracks for the
                   space allocation for new files being received
                   from the local Kermit.  Default is 5.

))START-OF-PACKET 'num' - With SEND or RECEIVE:
                Control character to mark start of packet, normally
                Ctrl-A (ASCII 1).  May be 0-31.

))SUFFIX 'string' - With FOREIGN:
                   The specified string is added to the end of outbound
                   filespecs.

))TABS 'OFF | ON | ON,tab-list' - Enables or disables tab expansion for
                                  files being received. Default is OFF.
                  OFF         - Disables expansion.
                  ON          - Enables expansion and specifies tabs
                                at columns 9, 17, 25, etc.
                  ON,tab-list - Enables expansion and specifies use
                                of tab stops listed in 'tab-list'.

                        used by Kermit-TSO.  See the description under
                        ATOE.
))TEST 'ON | OFF' -
                   Used for testing new versions, suppresses block check
                   verification, allows start-of-packet to be set to
                   anything at all.  The default if OFF.

))TETOA 'num1' 'num2' - Modifies the EBCDIC-to-ASCII translate table
                        used by Kermit-TSO.  See the description under
                        ATOE.

                   Number of seconds to wait for a packet before
                   retransmitting.

))TIMER 'ON | OFF' - Specifies whether Kermit-TSO is to attempt to
                     time out from waiting for packets from the other
                     Kermit.  The default is ON.

))TTABLE 'ON | OFF' -
                   Controls whether ATOE/ETOA or TATOE/TETOA are used
                   for counteracting the system translations on TTY
                   lines.  The default is OFF (use ATOE/ETOA).

))TYPE 'Binary | Text | V-binary | D-binary' -
                   With FILE: specifies the file type of the data and
                   determines the type of translation, if any, to use.
        Binary   - Specifies non-delimited, bit-stream data.  No trans-
                   lation is performed, and no carriage return/linefeed
                   pairs are added to outgoing records.  Incoming bytes
                   are added successively to the current record, which
                   is written out when the specified logical record
                   length (LRECL) is reached.
        Text     - Specifies textual data.  ASCII-to-EBCDIC and
                   EBCDIC-to-ASCII translation is performed on the
                   data using the defined translate tables.  Carriage
                   return/linefeed pairs are used to delimit the
                   records.  This is the default.
        V-binary - Specifies variable-length binary records.  Like
                   BINARY, except that a 2-byte length field precedes
                   each outbound record, and is assumed for incoming
                   records.  Incoming records are stripped of their
                   prefixes and written out when the prefix value is
                   reached.  This is useful when the record format is
                   unformatted (RECFM=U) or variable (RECFM=V).
        D-binary - Specifies variable-length binary records.  Like
                   V-BINARY, except that the prefix field is a 5-byte
                   ASCII decimal string.

))UNIT 'name' - With FILE:
                   Specifies the name of the device type or class for
                   storing new files (e.g., received from the local
                   Kermit).  The default is SYSDA.

))VOLUME 'name' - With FILE:
                   Specifies the name of the particular storage volume
                   for storing new files (e.g., received from the local
                   Kermit).  The default is blank (the system will
                   choose any volume of the specified UNIT class).

))WARNING 'ON | OFF' - Specifies the course of action when a file
                       being received from the local Kermit has the
                       same name as a dataset which already exists.
              - If ON, Kermit-TSO changes the incoming file name so as
                not to obliterate the existing dataset, or requests
                permission to overwrite it if the name was given by the
                user.  This is the default.  Kermit-TSO attempts to
                rename an incoming file by appending a digit to the
                second qualifier of the dataset name.
              - If OFF, Kermit-TSO will replace the existing dataset.

))8-BIT-QUOTE 'ON | OFF | char' -
                   Controls whether eighth-bit prefixing is done and
                   specifies the character to be used.
