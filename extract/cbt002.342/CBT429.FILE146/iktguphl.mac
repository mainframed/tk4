)F FUNCTION -

  The GUPI command invokes GUPI-TSO, an assembly language program
which performs updates on line-numbered source files using a control
file syntax similar to that of IBM's UPDATE program for CMS.  The
main difference is that GUPI performs multiple updates in a single
invocation by reading all the updates from a single, sequential, input
control file.
