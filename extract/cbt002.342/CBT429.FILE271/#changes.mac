¸
°This  library  contains a complete Dynamic PROCLIB modification.  This
°modification is compatible with all versions of MVS/SP 1.3.3 to MVS/SP
°3.1.3.  This release of Dynamic PROCLIB includes  substantial  changes
°to  the  previous release(s) and REQUIRES de-installation of any level
°prior to 3.2.0 that is installed.

°The internal text key used for the SYSPROC= Parameter has been changed
°from the internal text reserved value of X'01' to X'23', which is  the
°internal text value for the HOLD= Parameter.  This was done to prevent
°an 0C1 Abend in the INTERPRETER when the SYSPROC parameter was used on
°a DD Statement other than the JOBPROC DD Statement.

°Note:    This change requires that the Superzap to IEFVFA that changes
°the SUBALLOC= Parameter to the SYSPROC= Parameter must be reapplied in
°order for the SYSPROC= Parameter to work.    Equally  now,  the  HOLD=
°Parameter could be used instead of the SYSPROC= Parameter

°The  subroutine  used to write error messages to the JCL Messages Data
°Set has been rewritten to use the standard Converter Message  Routine,
°IEFVGM.    This  provides  independence of future changes in Converter
°Message formats.  PTF UY31363 changes the JCL Statement  numbering  of
°the  Converter.    This  use  of the standard interface eliminates any
°incompatibilities with it and any previous levels.  Note:  The  reason
°for the non-standard interface is that until SU29, the only way to use
°the  standard  interface  was  to  modify  the  Converter Message Text
°Modules.  SU29 introduced a generalized message interface.

°The modifications for MVS/SP 3.1.0 have been updated to 3.1.3 and have
°been renamed from #ZSP31x to #YSP31x.

°A new SET Symbol (&SWA220) has been added to allow the  source  to  be

°3.1.0).    No  code  changes  were  made.    Only the Superzaps to the
°converter and interpreter and the SYSGEN Macro update were altered.

°There is a problem in Dynamic Allocation when 12 or more Data Sets are
°concatenated  which  leads to TIOT pollution.  Using a large number of
°JOBPROCs in a concatenation many times can lead to the JES TIOT  being
°filled  and  subsequent  JOBPROC allocations failing.  The IBM APAR is
°OY17555.  PTFs UY30156 (MVS/SP 2.2.0) and UY30157 (MVS/SP  3.1.0)  are
°available.  No fixes are available for earlier releases.

°                            Version 3.2.1
°                              July, 1988

°The  changes  made  in  this  release  of Dynamic PROCLIB are minor in
°nature and do not change the installation process.  However,  customi-
°zation is now easier to perform.

°Additional  SET  Symbols  have been added to allow the installation to
°choose defaults without having to resort to source code modification.

°The  &SYSPROC  SETB   Symbol   establishes   the   default   for   the
°SYSPROC=YES×NO  JCL  Parameter.    The  supplied default is "1", which
°indicates that SYSPROC=YES should be the default.   Specifying  a  "0"
°for the &SYSPROC SETB Symbol will make the default SYSPROC=NO.

°The  DDname for the JOBPROC DD Statement can now be specified with the
°&DDNAME SETC Symbol.  The supplied default is 'JOBPROC'.    When  this
°value is changed, all messages will have their text changed according-
°ly.

°The maximum number of PROCLIBs, including System PROCLIBs can be spec-
°ified by the SETA Symbol &MAXPROC.  The supplied default is 16.

°When  a JOBPROC DD Statement was specified after the first EXEC State-
°ment and no JOBPROC DD Statement had been specified before  the  first
°EXEC Statement, no JCL Error was detected and the JOBPROC DD Statement
°was  essentially ignored.  Now a "Misplaced JOBPROC Statement" message
°will be issued and a JCL Error is indicated.

°The error recovery code for an S213-04 Abend has been deleted,  as  it
°is  no  longer  needed.   The "Return DSORG" function of Dynamic Allo-
°cation (added in 3.2.0) verifies the existance of the DSCB.  Hence,  a
°213  Abend  will  occur  only if the User deletes the JOBPROC Data Set
°between the Dynamic Allocation and the OPEN.

°The DDnames used to allocate the JOBPROC  Data  Sets  are  once  again
°explicitly  specified.    The  use  of  the  System  assigned  DDnames
°(SYSnnnnn) results in gigantic Type 30 SMF Records for the JES Address

°Space.  Now all DDnames are of the format "Pttttttn", where "P" is the
°letter "P", "tttttt" is the hexadecimal Converter TCB Address, and "n"
°is the concatenation number (0-9,A-F).  The Enqueue that was necessary
°in  releases  of Dynamic PROCLIB before 3.2.0 is not necessary, as the
°TCB Address for multiple Converters  will  be  unique.    Also,  since
°certain  Converter  failures  may  result in the JOBPROC Data Sets not
°being freed, an attempt is made to dealloacte  them  during  Converter
°initialization.

°The  SWA  for  the JES Address Space in which the Converter is running
°may now be above the 16 Meg line.   The SWAREQ UNAUTH=YES  Service  is
°used to locate the JFCBs for System PROCLIBs when the SWA is above the
°line.  This feature requires PTF UY16002 from PUT Tape 8802.

°The  ESTAE  that  was  issued  and  cancelled during every call to the
°Dynamic PROCLIB code (which meant for every  JCL  Statement  in  every
°JOB) is now issued only during IEFVPP0 (initialization) processing and
°is  cancelled  during  IEFVPP3  (termination)  processing.   Since the
°Dynamic PROCLIB ESTAE is at a lower level than the one issued  by  the
°Converter  itself,  it  will receive control for all Converter Abends.
°Any error that did not occur during Dynamic  PROCLIB  processing  will
°simply  be  percolated  to  the Converter's ESTAE.   Also, if an error
°occurs in IEFVPP0 (initialization) processing, no JCL  Error  will  be
°indicated.    However, the use of JOBPROC DD Statements will result in
°JCL Errors.

°An error in the Superzap for IEFVDA for MVS/SP Systems  (#ZSP131)  has
°been corrected.  The first REP had the wrong address.

°                             March, 1988

°The changes made in this release of Dynamic PROCLIB cover a wide range
°of areas.  Changes were made to correct a minor MVS/SP 2.2.0 incompat-
°ibility, simplify installation, eliminate all but one Superzap, elimi-
°nate  the  special  System  PROCLIB  DD Statements in the JES JCL, and
°substantially cleanup the source of IEFVPP.

°Most of the labels in the source module (IEFVPP) have been changed  to
°clearly  identify  the  "location" of the label.   All Dynamic PROCLIB
°Work Area labels begin with  "PPW",  all  IEFVPP0  labels  begin  with
°"PP0", etc.

°A  problem  with MVS/SP 2.2.0 and JOBLIB DD Statements has been fixed.
°If a JOBPROC Statement followed a JOBLIB  Statement,  the  Interpreter
°would  Abend with a 0B0, generate an SVC Dump, and fail the Job.  This
°fix also eliminates the use of the reserved bit in the  Internal  Text
°Header  (which  IBM  will  sooner  or  later end up using).   This fix

°requires a new Superzap to Interpreter module IEFVDA,  but  eliminates
°the  Superzap to Interpreter module IEFVHE.  This change works for all
°Systems, not just MVS/SP 2.2.0.

°A series of IBM PTFs (which unfortunately  have  not  been  marked  in
°error and SMP/E "held") caused 05C-804 Abends in the Converter.  These
°Abends  are  not  the fault of Dynamic PROCLIB, but are MVS Allocation
°errors.  The APAR is OY08485 and PTFs UY14532, UY14533, and UY14534 on
°PUT Tape 8801 correct this problem.  As an aside, the changes made  in
°this release of Dynamic PROCLIB relating to the handling of the System
°PROCLIBs eliminates this problem as well.

°No  attempt  has been made to insure that this Dynamic PROCLIB support
°is compatible with a pre-MVS/SP Version 1  System.    In  fact,  while
°every  attempt  has  been  made  to  insure  compatibility with MVS/SP
°Version 1, this code has been tested only in MVS/SP  2.2.0  and  3.1.3
°environments.

°Assembler  H,  Version 2, and at least the MVS/SP Version 1 MACLIB and
°AMODGEN, are necessary to assemble IEFVPP without altering the source.

°The special debugging code (which puts out a bunch a trace messages to
°the Console) can be conditionally assembled in IEFVPP via a specifica-
°tion of 'SYSPARM(TRACE)' during assembly of  IEFVPP.    The  remaining
°options  (Message  Prefix and IEFUJV Internal Text Exit) still require
°altering SETC Statements in the source.

°The modification to IEFVFA to call IEFVPP4 and IEFVPP5 has been elimi-
°nated (and MUST be removed from existing  installations).    The  only
°Superzap  to IEFVFA that is "necessary" is the change of "SUBALLOC" to
°"SYSPROC".   If the SYSPROC JCL parameter is  not  going  to  be  used
°(i.e.,  default  of SYSPROC=YES), even this Superzap to IEFVFA becomes
°optional.

°The modification to IEFVHF to call IEFVPP3 has  been  eliminated  (and
°must  be  removed from existing installations).  This has been done by
°changing the IBM supplied IEFVHF CSECT to  IEFVHFX  and  supplying  an
°IEFVHF  CSECT  as  part  of  IEFVPP.   The supplied IEFVHF branches to
°IEFVHFX after performing it's processing.

°The optional Converter Superzap and the required Interpreter  Superzap
°are NO LONGER dependent on the word in the Converter Work Area used to
°anchor  the  Dynamic  PROCLIB Work Area.   Only IEFVPP need be changed
°should it be necessary to relocate this anchor due to Converter chang-
°es.

°The special set of PROCLIB DD Statements (IEF#PDSI) for each Converter
°have been totally eliminated.   The  "standard"  set  of  PROCLIB  DDs
°(PROCxx  in  JES2) are now used to determine the Data Set Names of the
°System PROCLIBs.  The are dynamically allocated  and  concatenated  to

°the User specified JOBPROC(s) when SYSPROC=NO is not specified.

°Special  Note:    This  feature  requires that Address Space which the
°Converter in running in (i.e., JES) must have its SWA below the 16 Meg
°Line.  Since JES does not use all that must SWA, this is not viewed as
°a serious restriction.  This restriction will be removed in  a  future
°release of this Dynamic PROCLIB Modification.

°The  special DDnames of IEF#PDS* (*=0-9,A-F) used to allocate the User
°specified JOBPROCs have been eliminated.    Instead,  System  assigned
°DDnames  (SYSnnnnn)  are used.   Hence, the ENQueues and DEQueues that
°were used to serialize the use of the DDnames are no longer  necessary
°and have been eliminated.

°Numerous cosmetic changes (beyond the label changes) have been made to
°the  source.    However, the basic processing logic remains unchanged,
°with the exception of the changes noted above.
