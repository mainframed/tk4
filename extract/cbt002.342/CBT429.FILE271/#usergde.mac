¸
°The MVS Dynamic PROCLIB Facility provides a User of MVS to specify the
°libraries  that are to be search for JCL Procedures without them being
°known in advance to the Job Entry SubSystem.

°Dynamic PROCLIBs are specified by the User as part of his or her Job's
°JCL via the use of one  or  more  JOBPROC  DD  Statements,  much  like
°JOBLIBs  and JOBCATs are specified.  The JOBPROC DD Statements and any
°concatenations (following standard JCL rules for  concatenation)  must
°be  specified  before  the  first EXEC Statement.   The JOBPROC DDname
°becomes a restricted DDname which can only be used  for  this  purpose
°and  any other use of a DDname of JOBPROC within a Job will be consid-
°ered a JCL Error.

°The JOBPROC DD Statements must specify, as a  minimum,  the  Data  Set
°Name  of the JCL Procedure Library.  The JCL Procedure Library must be
°a Fixed Blocked Partitioned Data  Set  (PDS)  with  a  Logical  Record
°Length  (LRECL)  of  80 and a Block Size (BLKSIZE) equal to or greater
°than the standard installation Procedure Library (because of rules for
°concatenation of unlike blocksizes).   If the JOBPROC  specified  Data
°Set is catalogued in a System Catalog (Master or User) using a defined
°high  level  index  (alias),  no  other  JCL Parameters are necessary.
°JOBPROC specified Data Sets CANNOT be located via a JOBCAT  specifica-
°tion.

°The  only  other  JCL  Parameters on the JOBPROC DD Statement that are
°examined are DISP, UNIT, VOL, and  SYSPROC  (see  below).    The  DISP
°Parameter  is  optional (defaults to DISP=SHR).  The only valid values
°are "OLD" and "SHR".  Even if DISP=OLD is specified, DISP=SHR is used.
°The UNIT Parameter can specify any valid  DASD  Device  Type  or  Unit
°Name.    The  VOL  Parameter can either be VOL=SER and VOL=REF and are
°coded according to the standard rules of JCL for  the  VOL  Parameter.
°The  UNIT and VOL Parameters are required ONLY if the JOBPROC Data Set
°is not catalogued.

°The SYSPROC Parameter is one that has been added to JCL,  specifically
°for  use on the JOBPROC DD Statement.  It is valid ONLY on the initial
°JOBPROC DD Statement (not on any concatenation) and  specifies  either
°SYSPROC=YES  or  SYSPROC=NO.    The default depends on an installation
°option.  SYSPROC=YES means that the System default Procedure Libraries
°will be automatically concatenated AFTER the JOBPROC specified  Proce-
°dure  Libraries.    SYSPROC=NO means that the System default Procedure
°Libraries will NOT be concatenated after the JOBPROC specified  Proce-
°dure  Libraries  and  that  only  the User specified Libraries will be
°searched for any required procedures.

°The maximum number of Procedure Libraries that  can  be  specified  in
°JOBPROC DD Statements is 16.  This number can be reduced by two items.
°First,  if SYSPROC=YES is specified (or defaulted), the number of User
°specified Procedure Libraries is decreased by  the  number  of  System
°default Procedure Libraries.  Second, the installation has the ability

°User  specified JOBPROC Data Sets must reside on mounted Direct Access
°Volumes.  If the specified Data Set does not exist on  Direct  Access,
°exists  on  a Volume that is not mounted, or is not a Partitioned Data
°Set, the Job will be failed with a JCL Error.  There is  no  provision
°to allow the Operator to mount the Volume before JCL Conversion.
