  Preface
               These modifications are constructed in four separate
               pieces because of functional ownership and
               maintenance packaging.

               The original source of this Mod is Mutual Life of
               Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.  Amdahl has provided
               substantial changes in the methods of installation
               and interfaces, as well as functional enhancements.
               The basic logic, however, is unchanged.

               The IEFVPP Module has been rewritten to be com-
               patible with all versions of the MVS Converter
               through MVS/SP 3.1.0.  However, it should be
               reassembled whenever a change is made to the
               Converter Work Area Macros (IEFCOMWA and IEFCVRWA).
               However, compatibility with MVS releases before
               MVS/SP 1.3.x cannot be guaranteed.

  JCLIN
               A JCLIN is necessary to include this support into
               and existing System.  However, in doing so, the
               changes of the external reference to IEFVHA in IEFVH1
               and the change of the CSECT name IEFVHF to IEFVHFX
               will not have taken place and the incorporation of
               Dynamic PROCLIB support will be incomplete.
               Specifically, the Converter will fail in the most
               horrible way.  A special sequence of modifications
               that must be installed before installing the new
               Converter Module (IEFVPP) is described later.
               The JCLIN is included in the modification that
               updated the SYSGEN Macro SGIEF409.

               The JCLIN is as follows:

              //SG13 EXEC LINKS,
              //  PARM='NCAL,LIST,XREF,LET,RENT',NAME=LINKLIB
              //SYSLIN DD *

                ENTRY IEFVH1
                NAME IEFVH1(R)
              /*

               This JCLIN was taken from the SYSGEN Stage 2.  The
               three statements marked by "====>" are the added
               statements.  Current Stage 1 output should be checked
               before the JCLIN is processed and any necessary
               changes made.

               The JCLIN is not necessary when installing these
               modification Pre-GEN.

  SYSGEN Macro
               The SYSGEN Macro, SGIEF409, is modified to contain
               the necessary Link Edit Control Statements to fully
               incorporate the modifications and to insure that a
               Re-SYSGEN does not "down level" the modifications.

               The Macro modifications consist of changing
               the external reference to IEFVHA in IEFVH1 to
               refer to IEFVPP0, which is the Dynamic PROCLIB
               initialization entry point, changing the CSECT name
               of IEFVHF to IEFVHFX, and including Module
               IEFVPP, which is a new Mdoule that conatins all
               Dynamic PROCLIB support, except the Superzaps to
               supply the new JCL Parameter and to allow the
               Interpreter to bypass Dynamic PROCLIB statements.

  Superzaps
               Superzaps are made to the Converter and Interpreter
               to provide a new JCL Keyword (optional) and to
               allow the interpreter to ignore the JOBPROC JCL
               Statements (required).  See the co-requisite
               modifications for a description of the logic
               associated with each of the modifications.
               The modules zapped are IEFVFA and IEFVDA.

  New Module
               IEFVPP is the new module added for this support.
               It is compatible with all currently supported
               versions of the Converter and Interpreter.
               However, it does require the use of Assembler H,
               Version 2, in order to assemble it.  The source
               module must be assembled with at least the MVS/SP V1
               level of "SYS1.AMODGEN" and may require the MVS/XA
               AMODGEN.  The resultant code should be compatible
               with MVS/370, MVS/XA, and MVS/ESA.
               Consult the assembly listing of IEFVPP for specific
               information on its functions and logic.

               It is recommneded that the IEFVPP source module
               be assembled by the installation and that the
               object deck provided in this modification be
               replaced with the one created by the assembly.

  Job Entry SubSystem Support
               JES2 is fully supported as the Dynamic PROCLIB
               code is not sensitive to the level of JES that
               is running.  However, it may have some problems
               in a JES3 environment, where performing the
               dynamic allocation od PROCLIBs os not subject
               to JES3 setup control.  No attempt has been
               made by the author to run it in a JES3 environment.

               This code fully supports the use of Dynamic
               PROCLIB(s) by Started Tasks and TSO Users.

  MSS Support (for those that still have them)
               A By-product of the MSS is that an MSS Volume
               containing a PROCLIB may not be mounted.  Since
               IEFVPP performs all locates and allocations
               requesting no mounting, such a PROCLIB will
               not be found, and the Job will be failed with a
               JCL Error.  However, even if the MSS Volume
               containing the PROCLIB is mounted, IEFVPP will
               still indicate a JCL Error, as there could
               be substantial delays in the Converter if it
               has to wait for staging or cylinder faults.
               Since the Converter can be a serial process,
               this could cause serious delays in Job processing,
               most noticably in TSO LOGONs.  An explicit check
               is made for MSS Volumes and PROCLIBs on them are
               not allowed.

  Installation
               An approach to putting the Dynamic PROCLIB support
               on is:

               1.  Apply the Superzaps to IEFVFA (optional) and
                   IEFVDA (required).  These Zaps will in no way
                   cause the Converter and Interpreter to work
                   any differently.
               2.  Apply the SYSGEN Macro update.  This will cause
                   the JCLIN changes to be processed by SMP.
                   The IEFVH1 and IEFVHF module entries in SMP
                   should be listed to insure that the CHANGE
                   statements have been picked up.
               3.  Create "dummy" Superzaps for modules IEFVH1
                   and IEFVHF.  Apply these Zaps to IEFVHA and IEFVHF.
               4.  Restore these "dummy" Zaps.  This will cause a
                   re-link of load module IEFVH1 and SMP will insert
                   the CHANGE statements, causing IEFVH1 to now point
                   to IEFVPP0 (unresolved) and will rename CSECT
                   IEFVHF to IEFVHFX when including it from the
                   DLIB.  The original IEFVHF CSECT will still
                   be in the IEFVH1 load module.
               5.  Apply the SYSMOD containing IEFVPP.  This will
                   resolve the external reference to IEFVPP0 and
                   will replace the original IEFVHF CSECT with
                   the small IEFVHF CSECT contained in it.
               6.  Since IEFVH1 and IEFNB903 are in LINKLIB in
                   MVS/XA and MVS/ESA, simply refresh the LLA LINKLIST
                   directory.
               7.  Since JES2 loads the Converter only once during
                   Converter Subtask initialization, JES2 must be
                   abended and restarted to have Dynamic PROCLIB
                   enabled without an IPL.  For testing, a secondary
                   JES2 would work just fine.

               Should it be necessary to restore the Converter to its
               original state, the following could be used:

               1.  Perfor the SMP restore of all modifications.
                   This assumes that the saved CDS will be used
                   to restore the origianl JCLIN for IEFVH1.
                   The same trick used to force an include of IEFVH1
                   and IEFVHF from the DLIB (this time without the
                   CHANGE statements will have to be done).
                   The IEFVHFX CSECT will remain behind in the
                   IEFVH1 load module, but this will cause no harm.
               2.  Refresh the LLA.
               3.  Abend and restart JES2.

  Previous Release Installation Considerations
               If a release of this Dynamic PROCLIB modification
               prior to Release 3.2.0 is installed with it's Zaps
               to IEFVFA, IEFVHE, and IEFVHF, these Zaps must be
               removed.  The easiest way to do this is to take the
               existing modifications to the modules and create new
               modifications, reversing the VERs and REPs that
               reference changes.  If the support for the SYSPROC
               JCL Parameter is wanted, IEFVFA would then be re-Zapped
               with only that change.

  PTF Level
               PTF Levels for the individual modules are noted
               with each module modification.
