°This Dynamic PROCLIB Modification  is  copyrighted  by  Amdahl  Corpo-
°ration,  even  though  it  is  essentially in the public domain.   The
°intent of this copyright was to prevent it's appropriation and  inclu-
°sion in a product that is sold.  This code will remain free as long as
°Amdahl retains any rights to it.

°This  copyright,  however,  has not prevented at least one vendor of a
°Dynamic PROCLIB from using MOST of the code contained in IEFVPP as the
°basis for their product.  This was done by an ex-Amdahl employee  that
°had no involvement whatsoever in the development or enhancement of any
°version  of  the  Amdahl Dynamic PROCLIB Modification.  As noted, this
°Dynamic PROCLIB Modification originally came from Mutual Life of Cana-
°da.

°This vendor, who shall remain nameless here, nevertheless is guilty of
°poor ethics.  And if people are willing to pay a substantial amount of
°money for something that's available in the  public  domain,  well,  I
°guess that there's a sucker born every minute.
