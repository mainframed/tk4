°                            Version 3.2.4
°                            December, 1990
°                 De-installation of Previous Releases
¸
°Those  installations  that  have installed any release of this Dynamic
°PROCLIB support before 3.2.0 will have to partially "de-install" their
°current release before installing this one.  Release 3.2.1 (or  later)
°can be installed on top of 3.2.0 with no de-installation process.

°If  any  3.2.x  Release is installed on a System containing a 3.1.x or
°earlier level of Dynamic PROCLIB, the 3.1.x  Release  must  be  de-in-
°stalled  first.    In addition, 3.2.x must be installed on all Systems
°sharing a Multi-Access SPOOL, as the method of "deleting"  JOBPROC  DD
°Statements  changed  between these Releases and JCL Errors will result
°for Jobs converted on a 3.2.x Dynamic PROCLIB and executed on a  3.1.x
°Dynamic PROCLIB or vice-versa.

°The Superzap to Interpreter module IEFVHE is no longer needed.  Howev-
°er,  it  is  (currently)  harmless to leave it installed.  However, it
°should be removed when convenient as it references the reserved bit in
°the Internal Text Header which might get used by IBM someday.

°The Superzaps to Converter modules IEFVFA and IEFVHF are also no long-
°er needed and MUST be removed, as the  entry  point  vector  table  no
°longer  exists  in  the  Dynamic PROCLIB Work Area.  Failure to remove
°these Superzaps will result in Converter failure.

°The best way to remove these Superzaps is to create new Superzaps that
°"reverse" the VER and REP Statements that alter the  modules.    These
°can  be  applied and since the results is that the modules are back to
°their IBM supplied state, SMP UCLIN can be used to delete the USERMODs
°and update the UMIDs of the modules.

°Performing these updates against an active System on MVS/370 will have
°no immediate impact, as the Converter and Interpreter are in the  Link
°Pack Area.  However, on MVS/XA, both the Converter and Interpreter are
°in  LINKLIB.   Any change to the Interpreter that does not change it's
°location in LINKLIB will be immediately  effective  on  the  next  Job
°going  through interpretation.   Any change to the Converter (at least
°in a JES2 environment) will only be picked up  when  JES  reloads  the
°Converter  module, which normally only occurs during initial Converter
°Subtask initialization and possibly after a Converter Abend.
