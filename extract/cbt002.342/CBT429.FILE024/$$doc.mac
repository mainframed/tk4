  'XFERDUMP' IS A SOFTWARE SYSTEM THAT ARCHIVES 'SYS1.DUMPXX' DATA
TO TAPE FOR A SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME, PLUS AUTOMATICALLY CLEARING
THE DUMP DATASETS AS WELL AS MAINTAINING AN ENTRY IN AN 'INDEX'
DATASET OF THE DUMP TITLES WITH THEIR ASSOCIATED TAPE VOLSER TO WHICH
THEY WERE ARCHIVED.

  THE ORIGINAL SOFTWARE WAS WRITTEN BY HOWARD DEAN OF 'AMERICAN
PRESIDENTIAL LINES', CALIFORNIA.  THE PRESENT SOFTWARE IN PRODUCTION
AT MCI TELECOMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION HAS BEEN MODIFIED QUITE EXTEN-
SIVELY AS WELL ADDITION OF OTHER DESIRABLE FEATURES TO SUCH A SYSTEM.
