+
+  SYSLOG weekly dumping is invoked via primary menu option 'DW'.  This
+ option submits an IEBGENER which dumps the online SYSLOG dataset
+ (D061001.SYSLOGD) to the quarterly archival tape as requested on the
+ DW panel.  DISP=MOD adds the current weekly online SYSLOG data to the
+ Step 'WEEKSCAN' reports the range of the weekly syslog being dumped.
+ Step 'QTRSCAN' runs through the entire tape and reports the date and
+ time range found.  This is done primarily for hardcopy documentation.
+ Two subsequent steps conditionally DELETE then REALLOCATE dataset
+ D061001.SYSLOGD, respectively.  These steps 'prime' this online
+ repository dataset for another week of SYSLOG collection.  An addition
+ step ('OPTIONE') reports exception events for the week being dumped. T
+ report produced by this step is identical to the primary menu's option
+ report.  It was added to the DUMP WEEKLY jobstream to ensure execution
+ on a weekly basis. Read option 'E's tutorial for details regarding exc
+ tion event reporting.
+
% Output from this JOB should be filed with the Quarterly tape.
