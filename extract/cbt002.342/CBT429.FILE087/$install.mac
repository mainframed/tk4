  THIS UTILITY WAS WRITTEN AS A RESULT OF A DP AUDIT REQUIREMENT
WHICH DICTATED THAT THE SYSLOG BE PRINTED AND RETAINED.  THE PRACTICAL
ALTERNATIVE IS TO RETAIN THE SYSLOG ON SOME MACHINE-READABLE MEDIUM.
TO ACHIEVE THIS END, THE ABL ISPF SYSLOG UTILITY WAS CREATED. THE
UTILITY IS COMPRISED OF ASSEMBLER PROGRAMS, CLISTS, JCL, AND,
OF COURSE, MAKES USE OF THE VARIOUS ISPF CAPABILITIES. MENU OPTIONS
PROVIDE THE ABILITY TO 'AUTOMATICALLY' RETAIN THE SYSLOG DATA; SUBSE-
QUENTLY EXTRACT PERTINENT PORTIONS OF THE RETAINED SYSLOG; PERFORM
VARIOUS UTILITY FUNCTIONS (E.G,. LABEL TAPES); OBTAIN REPORTS CONTAINING
USER-SPECIFIED 'EXCEPTION' EVENTS (SYSLOG POST-PROCESSOR). EXTRA EFFORT
WAS SPENT ATTEMPTING TO CREATE THE ISPF TUTORIAL PANELS TO SUPPORT THIS
UTILITY WITH A MINIMUM EFFORT ON THE PART OF SYSTEMS.

THIS IS A FAIRLY SIMPLE SYSTEM; A SHARP OPERATOR SHOULD BE ABLE TO PER-
FORM MUCH OF THE INSTALLATION. THE EASIST INSTALL PATH IS TO BEGIN
REVIEWING THE ISPF PANELS, ESPECIALLY THE TUTORIALS. YOU WILL FIND
THESE GENEROUS WITH DETAIL AND CROSS-REFERENCING IS USED FREQUENTLY.
SEE MEMBER $$$INDEX FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSLOG UTILITY COMPONENTS.
MODIFICATIONS TO SUIT YOUR SHOP'S STANDARDS GOES WITHOUT SAYING. DESPITE
THIS UTILITY'S PURPORTED SIMPLICITY, IT IS STRONGLY ADVISED THAT ALL
COMPONENTS BE THOROUGHLY REVIEWED IN THEIR ENTIRETY BEFORE TESTING AT
YOUR SHOP.  THERE ARE ALWAYS MORE THAN ENOUGH 'MINOR DETAILS' THAT CAN
GO AWRY AND WREAK HAVOC AMONG THE MASSES.

 THIS UTILITY IS GREAT FOR 4381-TYPE SHOPS WHO CAN'T AFFORD THE LIKES
OF 'WE WON'T MENTION NAMES' TO PERFORM THE BASIC FUNCTIONS IT PROVIDES.
THE PDS CONTAINING THIS UTILITY OCCUPIES ONE MERE 3380 CYLINDER. IT
IS IN UNLOADED IEBCOPY FORMAT.

 AS WITH ANY APPLICATION, IMPROVEMENTS CAN BE MADE.  I WOULD GREATLY
APPRECIATE YOUR SUGGESTIONS, CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM, OR QUESTIONS RE-
GARDING THE USE OF THIS UTILITY.

 THANKS, AND MAY THIS PRODUCT BE OF USE TO YOU!     MARK
