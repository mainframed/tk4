ABL-DP POLICY AND PROCEDURES MANUAL SECTION 2.4 (WEEKLY PROCEDURES)

2.4.1 SYSLOG Retention

The system LOG (SYSLOG) is retained in online dataset 'D061001.SYSLOGD'
during the week and is then dumped to a quarterly archive tape on the
last working day of each week and on the last working day of each
quarter.  TSO SPF UTILITIES SYSLOG option 'DW' facilitates this dumping.
Option DW also automatically generates a report of 'exception' events
which is reviewed weekly to address potential problem areas.

 Archived SYSLOG data is retained for one year.  Any portion of the
SYSLOG may be printed at any time using the SPF SYSLOG application.  A
tutorial is available within the SYSLOG application that explains in
detail the weekly dump procedure as well as other SYSLOG functions
(e.g., report generation, SYSLOG searching).

 Use of the SPF SYSLOG application is restricted to data processing
personnel.

 1. LOGON to TSO

 3. From the SYSLOG Primary Menu, select option DW
 4. Supply the QUARTER and YEAR info then press ENTER to SUBMIT
 5. Check the JOB's output for successful completion
 6. File JOB output with quarterly tape, discarding last week's output.
