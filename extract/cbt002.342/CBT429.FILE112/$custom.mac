     It is important to customize the sort tables in the VTOCCMD CSECT
(member VTOC, VT0C, OR VT2C).  When sorting many dataset names I saw a
decrease of over 50% in CPU usage (15 seconds instead of 38) and a
greater decrease in elapsed time (41 seconds instead of 176) after I
customized the tables for my installation.
