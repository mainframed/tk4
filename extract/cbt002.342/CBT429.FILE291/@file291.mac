//***FILE 291 is from Rick Hevener of the University of South       *
//*           Carolina, and contains a program to measure CPU       *
//*           instruction execution speed.  This program is         *
//*           supposed to be a bit better than others of its        *
//*           type (I think).  Included in this file, is an         *
//*           article from Technical Support magazine which         *
//*           describes how this program works, and what kind       *
//*           of results you can obtain, using it.                  *

//*     The program in TIMINGSP may be used to test timings of      *
//*     a large number of instructions on mainframe IBM or plug     *
//*     compatible computers.  The method involves cycling          *
//*     through a loop 5,000 times with 11 instructions per         *
//*     cycle; the overhead for the loop is then subtracted.        *
//*     It takes approx.  one second of CPU time on our             *
//*     9672-R53.  The only macros required are in SYS1.MACLIB.     *
//*     The numeric parameters described above are easily           *
//*     changed.                                                    *
//*                                                                 *
//*     The original program is in member TIMINGSO.  It             *
//*     employed 50,000 cycles per loop with only one               *
//*     instruction per cycle.  That program and its results        *
//*     are described in the following article, which is            *
//*     reproduced here in member $ARTICLE:                         *

//*     In Sep. 1999, Mr. Jim Melnyk of Great-West Life sent        *
//*     me e-mail inquiring about some peculiar results he had      *
//*     obtained using the original program.  He had gotten         *
//*     negative times for certain instructions on a 9672-RC6.      *
//*     After several attempts, I was able to modify the            *
//*     program to achieve reasonable timings on both that          *
//*     machine and a 9672-R55 that Jim later discovered also       *
//*     produced spurious results.  He also tested on a             *
//*     9672-R24, obtaining output consistent with the original     *
//*     program, as I did on our 9672-R53.                          *
//*                                                                 *
//*     I would like to acknowledge Jim's assistance in testing     *
//*     various versions of the program on his three machines.      *
//*     I would also like to thank him for suggesting that I        *
//*     employ a loop macro to facilitate changes.                  *
