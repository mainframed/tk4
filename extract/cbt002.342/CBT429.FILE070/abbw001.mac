         THIS MODIFICATION CAUSES THE GDG BASE LEVEL TO BE UPDATED
         AT THE END OF EACH STEP RATHER THAN REMAIN THE SAME
         THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE JOB. THIS IS DONE BY APPLYING A
         ZAP TO GDG SINGLE PROCESSING (IEFAB461) TO CAUSE GDGNT SEARCH
         TO FAIL FOR ALL DATA SETS .  THIS CAUSES JLOCATE (IEFAB469)
         TO OBTAIN THE CURRENT BASE GENERATION FROM THE CATALOG
         RATHER THAN USING THE OLD ONE FROM THE GDGNT. ZAP ALSO
         FORCES REUSE OF THE FIRST GDGNT ENTRY TO CONSERVE SWA AND
         AVOID UNECESSARY SEARCHES OF A LENGTHY GDGNT .
                                                                 */ .
