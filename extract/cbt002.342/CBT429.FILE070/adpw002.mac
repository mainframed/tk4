       DATASET MUST BE ALLOCATED DISP=OLD IF AN UPDATE IS BEING
       DONE. THIS ALLOWS A BATCH UPDATE PROGRAM TO BE RUN AGAINST
       AN IMS DATABASE WITHOUT BRINGING IMS DOWN. THIS IS FOR
       A PRE IMS 1.1.5 SYSTEM WHERE YOU CANNOT DYNAMICALLY
       ALLOCATE ALL YOUR DATABASES AT IMS STARTUP TIME.

       YOU MUST (AND I MEAN MUST) TAKE POSITIVE STEPS TO INSURE
       THAT (1) THE IMS DATABASE IS DBR'D WHILE YOU ARE RUNNING
       ANY BATCH UPDATES AGAINST IT AND/OR (2) YOU DO NOT ATTEMPT
       TO SCHEDULE TWO BATCH JOBS WHICH UPDATE THE SAME ISAM DATA-
       SET AT THE SAME TIME.
