ISR@PRIM    -  ISPF/PDF Primary Option Panel

                J - Jump commands, allows you to quickly Edit, Browse,
                    and PRINTOFF frequently used data sets and PDS
                    members.  All of the options offered under J should
                    also be added to the ISR@PRIM panel.  Option J is
                    just used as a way of putting them together in a
                    group.

                U - USERPANL,  Our ISPF/PDF preprocessor allocates the
                    user's panel libraries (if any) before the ISPF/PDF
                    panel libraries.  This option gives our users a way
                    into their panels without their needing their own
                    ISR@PRIM panel.  The users only have to create a
                    panel named USERPANL and have all of their panels
                    accessable thru it.  This allows us to update
                    ISR@PRIM without the customer being affected.

          XL, XLN - Exit-and-logoff, and Exit-and-logon.
                    Also in the INIT section of ISR@PRIM is some code
                    which allows the XL and XLN options to work.  A
                    varaible &WEI is checked for the value 'G', if it is
                    set then a command to be executed is stored in
                    another variable &HOPT.  When &WEI is set to 'G' the
                    &ZCMD is set to the command in &HOPT, &WEI is set to
                    'N' and the .RESP is set to ENTER so the command
                    will get executed.  In the PROC section the variable
                    &OROPT is set to the truncated value of &ZCMD.  If
                    the command entered is XL or XLN the command of 'X'
                    is stored in &HOPT and &WEI is set to 'G' so that an
                    exit will be executed on return from the options XL
                    and XLN's CLISTs.

      The following options are not described on the Primary panel but
      are valid options:

                E -  WSRCC User Library Edit.  By setting up a selection
                     list the user can quickly edit (with the ISPF/PDF
                     Editor) any dataset or member of a PDS within the
                     selection list by simply entering E.DS where DS is
                     the selection code assigned to a dataset or PDS
                     thru the selection list.  If DS is a PDS you can
                     edit a member of it by entering E.DS.member, or get
                     a member list by E.DS, or a selected member list be
                     E.DS.a* (to get all members starting with the
                     letter A).  If the dataset specified by DS is not
                     cataloged you can specify the VOLUME by entering
                     E.DS.member.VOLUME, if you want a member selection
                     list you specify it as E.DS.*.VOLUME.

                B -  WSRCC User Library Browse. B uses the same
                     selection list that is set up for Edit, see above,
                     only the function is Browse.

              PRT -  WSRCC User Library PRINTOFF.  This uses the same
                     selection list that is set up for Edit, see above,
                     only the function is PRINTOFF.  Before the dataset
                     is printed a PRINTOFF Options selection panel is
                     displayed so desired options can be specified.  If
                     the dataset is a PDS and no member has been
                     specified (or a selected member list was specified)
                     you get a member selection list, after
                     selecting members and hitting "END" each member
                     is printed.

              PR1 -  This option also does a PRINTOFF as above but the
                     PRINTOFF options are pre selected and stored by
                     the J.SET option.

              PR2 -  This option is the same as above but with a
                     different set of PRINTOFF options, also set and
                     stored by the J.SET option.

          NEWUSER -  In the INIT section of the ISR@PRIM is a
                     check for a NULL value for the variable &NU.
                     If the variable is NULL then the ZCMD is set
                     to the option NEWUSER and .RESP is set to ENTER.
                     This forces all NEW users to go thru our NEW USER
                     CLIST which sets up JOB cards.  The variable &NU is
                     set by our CLIST and stored in the users profile so
                     they only go thru it once.  The code is commented
                     out in the panel.
