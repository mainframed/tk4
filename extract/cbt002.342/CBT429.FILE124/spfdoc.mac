                 ISPF/PDF Preprocessor

   To get into ISPF/PDF you must use the WSRCC ISPF/PDF Preprocessor
 SPF.  SPF will allocate all of the required ISPF/PDF files and
 optionaly concatinate any special files specified.

   When you enter the command "SPF" the program goes thru the DDnames
 allocated to your TSO session and only allocates the ISPF/PDF required
 DDnames that are not already allocated.  If you want to add your
 libraries to the allocated ISPF/PDF libraries you can do it by creating
 a member in your TSO.PROFILE.Logon-id file called WPROFILE.  The "SPF"
 preprocessor looks for a WPROFILE member before allocating the ISPF/PDF
 files.  If it finds a member it will read and process the entries which
 are used to modify what files get allocated for ISPF/PDF.  You must
 code the entries in your WPROFILE member carefully because the
 preprocessor is Position and Syntax sensative.  There are 9 types of
 data lines that can be entered, the first type being a comment.  Lines
 begining with an '*' are treated as comments.  The other 8 types start
 with a 4 character type identifier that describes the DDname under
 which it should be allocated. After the 4 character identifier is a
 space and then a dataset name (without quotes).  The datasets are
 allocated ahead of the default libraries and in the same order as they
 are entered in the WPROFILE member, the order is maintained even if all
 the entries of one type are not together.

    The WPROFILE member entry types that can be coded are:

        *    - Comment line
        CLIB - ISPF CLIST LIBRARY
        PLIB - ISPF Panel LIBRARY
        MLIB - ISPF Message LIBRARY
        SLIB - ISPF Skeleton LIBRARY
        TLIB - ISPF Table LIBRARY
        LLIB - ISPF Load LIBRARY
        TABL - ISPF Table FILE
        FILE - ISPF Table FILE

    A SAMPLE WPROFILE MEMBER:

                **********************************
                ** WPROFILE LIBRARIES           **
                **********************************
                CLIB ADM.DP59022.SRCLIB
                PLIB ADM.DP59022.SRCLIB
                MLIB ADM.DP59022.SRCLIB

    All libraries that you add must have blocksizes of 9040 or larger,
 except for the Load Library LLIB.

    If you do not wish to have the default libraries allocated after
 your files, or if you are including the default libraries in your
 WPROFILE member, you must code the 4 character identifier and a space
 and the keyword "NODEFAULT" (or "NODEF"). This tells the preprocessor
 NOT to allocate the default libraries.  There is no default for TABL.

    All of the DDnames referred to are ISP and then the 4 character type
 identifier (example: PLIB ==> ISPPLIB), except for CLIB.  The DDname
 that CLIB modfies is SYSPROC.

    If you modify your (or create a) WPROFILE member you must go out of
 ISPF/PDF and free the DDname(s) for which you made a change or entry,
 and then invoke "SPF", otherwise the change will not take effect.  The
 SYSPROC (CLIB) DD will not be freed with a FREEALL command, you must
 FREE DD(SYSPROC) to free it.

    You can have more than one "WPROFILE" member to control the
 allocation of ISPF/PDF Files.  To create a different member just
 change the "W" to some other letter (as in APROFILE) and then to
 specify which PROFILE member to use you invoke the ISPF/PDF
 preprocessor with: "SPF <A" (to use APROFILE).

    If you do not want any "WPROFILE" member used you can invoke
 ISPF/PDF with: "SPF </".

    SPF is set up to recognize any user with a "SYSSPF DD DUMMY"
 DD card in their TSO LOGON PROC as a Systems programmer.

    SPF is only set up to use 6 character LOGON-IDs.

    SPF Requires a ISPF/PDF PROFILE PDS with the name:
        TSO.PROFILE.logon-ID
