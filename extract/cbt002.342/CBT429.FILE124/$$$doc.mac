    A description of the members of this PDS:


$$$DOC      -  This member.

AUTH        -  MACRO, used by SPF (see below).  AUTH is used by
               the SPF program to invoke SVC 233 to turn on and
               off JSCB Authorization.

BPPL        -  Macro taken from CBT Tape Version 259 file 270.
               Used in assembly of STACK program.

EDPRD       -  ISREDIT macro to invoke the PRINTDS command for the
               dataset being edited.  Uses the PDPANL panel to prompt
               for options which are saved in the profile.  The macro
               works against the disk version of the dataset so if
               changes have been made the dataset must be "SAVE"ed
               before invoking EDPRD.

EDPRT       -  ISREDIT macro to invoke the PRINTOFF command for the
               dataset being edited.  Uses the PRPANL panel to prompt
               for options which are saved in the profile.  The macro
               works against the disk version of the dataset so if
               changes have been made the dataset must be "SAVE"ed
               before invoking EDPRT.

EDSCR       -  ISREDIT macro to invoke the SCRIPT command for the
               dataset being edited.  Uses the SCPANL panel to prompt
               for options which are saved in the profile.  The macro
               works against the disk version of the dataset so if
               changes have been made the dataset must be "SAVE"ed
               before invoking EDSCR.

ENTERR      -  Macro taken from CBT Tape Version 259 file 270.
               Used in assembly of STACK program.

GDGUTIL     -  ISPF CLIST which invokes several functions one might want
               to do to a GDG.  Create, List index, List datasets Modify
               limit and Delete.  Can be used from panel 6 or included
               as a selection entry on another panel.  Uses GDGUTILP
               panel and RESETGDG program to do the work.

GDGUTILP    -  ISPF PANEL used by GDGUTIL, see above.

IGC0023C    -  SVC 233.  This is a Nno-authorized type 3 SVC that
               turns bits in the JSCB on or off based on an entry
               code is register 1.  It is called by the AUTH Macro
               which is used by the SPF program (see below).

SPF         -  WSRCC's preprocessor which allocates ISPF/PDF files
               and invokes ISPF/PDF.

SPFDOC      -  Documentation for WSRCC's ISPF/PDF PREPROCESSOR

STACK       -  STACK program as taken from CBT Tape 259 file 270,
               used for ISPF/PDF XL (exit and logoff) and XLN (exit and
               logon) options.

STACKDOC    -  STACK program documentation, also as taken from
               CBT Tape Version 259, file 270.

WPROFILE    -  Sample member for use by WSRCC ISPF/PDF Preprosessor,
               allocates ISPF/PDF files as used by WSRCC Customer
               rather than as WSRCC System's Programmer.

WSRCCEP1    -  This panel is called by all of the J commands (except for
               SET), it decodes the command's selection code into a full
               data set name and invokes the WSRCEPCL CLIST to handel
               the requested command.

               Several datasets and selection codes are codded into
               the WSRCCEP1 panel and do not need to be added to each
               individual's selections, the are frequently used PDSs:

                  Code         Library
                   S1        SYS1.PROCLIB
                   S2        SYS2.PROCLIB
                   PA        SYS1.PARMLIB
                   C2        SYS2.CLISTLIB
                   TSO       SYS2.TSOPROCS
                   STC       SYS2.STCPROCS

WSRCCLPN    -  This panel is the J Jump command selection panel.
               All of the command options are also added to the
               ISR@PRIM primary panel so you do not need to enter
               J infront of each option,  this panel is mainly used
               to show which functions work with the data set name
               selection codes.

WSRCEPCL    - This is the main Jump command CLIST.  This CLIST is
              called by all of the J panel options (except SET) and
              it invokes all of the J panel commands.

WSRCESET    -  Selection code and Data Set Name setting for J options.
               This PANEL is called by option J.SET and it allows you to
               set up selection codes and data set names and the
               PRINTOFF options for PR1 and PR2.

WSRCMDS     -  XSPLIT
               This is an EXAMPLE of the entry in our ISPCMDS which
               allows us to enter XSPLIT (abrv. XS) on any command line
               and bring up a new Primary Option Panel (ISR@PRIM) on top
               of the current ISPF/PDF screen.  You can then do any
               ISPF/PDF (almost) options and when you are through you
               enter =X and go back to the screen you entered the XSPLIT
               on.  This works sort of like an extra SPLIT, but you
               still only have 2 screens to swap between.

WSRCPRTC    -  PDS MEMBER LIST, SELECT, AND PRINTOFF CLIST
               This CLIST is used by other clists (WSRCEPCL, PRT, and
               PRT's aliases) to display a pds member selection list and
               then PRINTOFF each of the members selected.

WTP         -  Macro taken from CBT Tape Version 259 file 270.
               Used in assembly of STACK program.

XABGN       -  Macro, used by SPF program to set up standard linkage
               at the begining of the program.

XAFIN       -  Macro, used by SPF program to exit and free up
               work area getmained by XABGN.

XL          -  EXIT ISPF AND LOGOFF CLIST
               This small CLIST issues the STACK Command to stack
               a LOGOFF command, it is called by option XL in
               ISR@PRIM.

XLN         -  EXIT ISPF AND LOGON CLIST
               This small CLIST issues the STACK Command to stack
               a LOGON command, it is called by option XLN in
               ISR@PRIM.  The CLIST does a VGET for 2 variables,
               XT1 and XT2.  X1 is the logon-id to be logged on
               and XT2 (if specified) is an alternate logon proc
               to be used.
