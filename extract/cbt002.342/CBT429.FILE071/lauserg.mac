 The L.A. MVS USERS GROUP TAPE is at LEVEL 72 (according to the copy we
 have in our possession).  Contents of this tape are now included in
 the CBT Overflow Tape Version 417V, and the CBT MVS Utilities Tape.

 Tom Beuthin told me that Version 72 is the last version that the group
 has produced to date.
