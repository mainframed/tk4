//* --  Welcome to the CBT Overflow Tape.  This tape contains    -- *
//* --  material that was deleted from older CBT tapes because   -- *
//* --  the regular CBT Tape filled up.                          -- *
//* --                                                           -- *
//* --  There is much other useful stuff on this tape, which     -- *
//* --  is hard to find.  Look below to get a glimpse at some    -- *
//* --  of the goodies we have here.                             -- *
//* --                                                           -- *
//* --  I have included a lot of code on this tape, which        -- *
//* --  never got a chance to be included in the CBT Tape.       -- *
//* --  Four files, 012 thru 015, contain the UK GUIDE tape,     -- *
//* --  the German GUIDE tape, the Swiss GUIDE tape, and the     -- *
//* --  Australian GUIDE tape, respectively.  These alone,       -- *
//* --  contain lots of useful materials.                        -- *
//* --------------------------------------------------------------- *
//* --  Short note:   Since the MVS SHARE Tape (SPLA TAPE)       -- *
//* --        code appears on this tape, I'd be happy to take    -- *
//* --        any updates and enhancements for this code.        -- *
//* --                                                           -- *
//* --        If you'd like to update any of the SPLA Tape code, -- *
//* --        please email me at:                                -- *

//* --  I have also included some newer code too, that doesn't   -- *
//* --  appear anywhere else.  Files 043-057 contain what would  -- *
//* --  have been the "SHARE ISPF Smoke and Mirrors Tape".       -- *
//* --  This is from Jim Marshall, and was a SHARE project       -- *
//* --  that got started, but which was unable to continue.      -- *
//* --  A prototype first tape was produced, and that is what    -- *
//* --  appears here.                                            -- *
//* --                                                           -- *
//* --  We have now included the entire "SHARE MVS Tape" on      -- *
//* --  this tape.  SHARE MVS Tape (or "SPLA Tape") Version      -- *
//* --  46, was the last tape that was supported by the SHARE    -- *
//* --  organization.  The SPLA MVS Tape is now "officially      -- *
//* --  dead" as far as the SHARE organization is concerned.     -- *
//* --  Therefore we have included it in its entirety, here.     -- *
//* --                                                           -- *
//* --  OUR PURPOSE IS TO CONTINUE TO MAKE ITS CODE AVAILABLE    -- *
//* --  AND TO HAVE A PLACE TO MAINTAIN UPDATES.                 -- *
//* --                                                           -- *
//* --  The original doc for SPLA Tape Version 46 is on File     -- *
//* --  104.  All other SPLA Tape files are on this tape in      -- *
//* --  100 plus the file number on the original SPLA Tape,      -- *
//* --  except for the L.A. MVS Users Group Tape material, as    -- *
//* --  per our comments just below.                             -- *
//* --                                                           -- *
//* --  However, we are updating some of the files of the SPLA   -- *
//* --  Tape as required.  We have, in effect, taken over all    -- *
//* --  the code from the SPLA Tape on this tape.  (Thanks to    -- *
//* --  Dan Squillace of the SAS Institute in Cary, North        -- *
//* --  Carolina.)  Since the SPLA tape had included a version   -- *
//* --  of the Los Angeles MVS Users Group Tape, we have         -- *
//* --  updated those files to the highest version of the L.A.   -- *
//* --  Users Group Tape that we have, Version 72.  Furthermore, -- *
//* --  we have separated out the files from the LA UG Tape and  -- *
//* --  placed them in their own block of files, Files 060-070.  -- *
//* --                                                           -- *
//* --  The PDS command is now on File 040, and has been         -- *
//* --  upgraded to the latest version.                          -- *
//* --                                                           -- *
//* --  THE SPLA TAPE FILES WHICH HAD CONTAINED LA UG TAPE       -- *
//* --  FILES, HAVE BEEN EMPTIED, AND THE DOCUMENTATION ON       -- *
//* --  THIS FILE, REFLECTS THIS.                                -- *
//* --                                                           -- *
//* --  The documentation from the original SHARE MVS Tape has   -- *
//* --  been merged into this documentation.  File numbers have  -- *
//* --  been adjusted.  The original documentation from SPLA     -- *
//* --  Tape V46 is on File 104 of this tape, and will be kept   -- *
//* --  there for reference without change.                      -- *
//* --                                                           -- *
//* --  Additionally, this tape will be a reference tape to      -- *
//* --  find a lot of older code, that people may want to learn  -- *
//* --  from.  Much of it may still work on modern systems, or   -- *
//* --  it may be slightly alterable to work.  In that regard,   -- *
//* --  this "OVERFLOW" tape will be a little different from     -- *
//* --  the regular CBT Tape which has mostly more current       -- *
//* --  code.  This tape will have quite a bit of older code,    -- *
//* --  but people need a place to find it when they want to     -- *
//* --  look at it.  Nevertheless, there will be quite a bit     -- *
//* --  of current code too.                                     -- *

//*   The tape copying program called "COPYMODS" on File 006        *
//*   of this tape, is useful for making byte-for-byte copies       *
//*   of this, and other tapes.  Up to 10 copies may be made        *
//*   at one time.  See documentation with that file.  It is        *
//*   the editor's experience that cartridges are handled without   *
//*   any problems by the "COPYMODS" program.  COPYMODS can also    *
//*   do tape-to-cart or cart-to-tape, but if you have multiple     *
//*   output tapes, do not mix unit types.                          *

//*   CAVEAT:  SL tapes are copied by the "COPYMODS" program,       *
//*            labels and all.  (This is good...  )  However,       *
//*            it is possible that if a "null" standard-label       *
//*            file is present on a tape, "COPYMODS" may            *
//*            interpret the "null" file as if it were a double     *
//*            tapemark and stop copying at that point.  In such    *
//*            a case, you might try using the "COPYFILE" program   *
//*            that is especially designed for SL tapes.  The       *
//*            "COPYFILE" program is part of File 316 on the        *
//*            CBT tape.  Also try "TAPESCAN" on File 009 here.     *
//*            FILE 008 ON THIS TAPE HAS LOAD MODULES.              *

//*   The "TAPEMAP" program on File 007, may be of further          *
//*   use in this and related endeavors.                            *

//*  This tape is NON-LABELED and contains 500 files.               *

//*  THE FIRST THREE FILES ON THIS TAPE ARE SEQUENTIAL FILES,       *
//*  RECFM=FB,LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=32720.                               *

//*  FILE 001 CONTAINS THIS INFORMATION (YOU ARE READING IT).       *
//*  IT IS A CATALOG OF WHAT'S ON THIS TAPE, AND IT HAS SUNDRY      *
//*  OTHER INFORMATION.                                             *
//*                                                                 *
//*  FILE 002 CONTAINS ASSEMBLER SOURCE FOR THE PROGRAM WHICH       *
//*  DECOMPRESSES MANY OF THE OTHER FILES ON THIS TAPE.  THAT       *
//*  PROGRAM IS CALLED CBT973.  I'D ADVISE ASSEMBLING AND           *
//*  LINKEDITING THE CBT973 PROGRAM, AND CUSTOMIZING THE JCL        *
//*  OF FILE 003 TO USE THE LINKEDITED PROGRAM.                     *
//*                                                                 *
//*  FILE 003 CONTAINS JCL TO LOAD THE OTHER (NONTRIVIAL) FILES     *
//*  ON THE TAPE TO DISK.  FILE 003 MAY BE CUSTOMIZED TO LOAD       *
//*  JUST A FEW OF THE FILES AT A TIME.                             *
//*                                                                 *
//*  MY OWN PRACTICE IS TO CREATE A PDS THAT CONTAINS THE CONTENTS  *
//*  OF FILES 001 AND 003.  THEN I WORK FROM THAT PDS TO CUSTOMIZE  *
//*  THE JCL ON FILE 003.  THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF VARIATIONS        *
//*  AMONG PEOPLE ON HOW THEY HANDLE A CBT TAPE.                    *
//*                                                                 *
//*  ONE THING FOR SURE--TRY TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THAT THIS TAPE    *
//*  IS UPDATED QUITE FREQUENTLY.  IT PAYS TO STAY AS CURRENT AS    *
//*  POSSIBLE.                                                      *
//*                                                                 *
//*  ONE FURTHER NOTE.  MOST SOURCE FILES ARE NOW IN IEBUPDTE       *
//*  SYSIN FORMAT SO THAT THE TAPEMAP PROGRAM CAN REPORT ON         *
//*  MEMBER NAMES CONTAINED IN THESE FILES.  THIS MEANS THAT        *
//*  THEY ARE UNLOADED PDS'ES.  PLAIN SEQUENTIAL FILES THAT WERE    *
//*  ON THE TAPE BEFORE, HAVE BEEN CONVERTED TO PDS'ES WITH A       *
//*  SINGLE MEMBER, SO THE TAPEMAP PROGRAM CAN REPORT THE MEMBER    *
//*  NAME.                                                          *
//*                                                                 *
//*  MOST NEW FILES ARE BEING STORED ON THE TAPE WITH ISPF STATS    *
//*  PRESERVED.  IN ORDER TO GET THE STATS, YOU HAVE TO USE THE     *
//*  PDSLOAD PROGRAM TO CONSTRUCT THE PDS, INSTEAD OF USING         *
//*  IEBUPDTE.  THE PDSLOAD LOAD MODULE IS ON FILE 008.  SEE THE    *
//*  NOTES ON PDSLOAD THAT ARE IN FILE 003 FOR FURTHER INSTRUCTION. *
//*  IN THE "FILE STATUS SECTION" BELOW IN THIS FILE, YOU CAN SEE   *
//*  THOSE FILES WHICH HAVE ISPF STATS PRESERVED, BY AN "S" MARKED  *
//*  AFTER THE COUNT OF THE NUMBER OF RECORDS IN THAT FILE.         *
//*                                                                 *

//*   The CBT Tape is now being edited by Sam Golob.  This tape     *
//*   was established and previously edited by Arnold               *
//*   Casinghino.  Arnie Casinghino has supported the Regular       *
//*   CBT Tape for over 15 years, from Version 1 through Version    *
//*   321.  Almost every MVS installation in the world has          *
//*   benefited in some way from materials on some version of       *
//*   this tape.  (Certainly EVERY MVS installation has             *
//*   benefited, because suggestions originating from materials     *
//*   on this tape have found their way to IBM development desks    *
//*   through user requirements, and have become a part of the      *
//*   MVS Operating System itself.)                                 *

//*   Our plan is to keep the initials "CBT" even though this       *
//*   tape is no longer supported at the Connecticut Bank and       *
//*   Trust Company, because those initials reflect how the tape    *
//*   should be properly and accurately referred to.  For now,      *
//*   I'm calling it the "CBT" MVS Utilities Tape without the       *
//*   initials CBT meaning anything special.                        *

//*        00  This documentation is now being lowercased, in       *
//*            part.  One reason is to make for easier display      *
//*            of Internet addresses.  The second is to make for    *
//*            easier reading.  (We gotta keep up with the times,   *
//*            too.)                                                *

//*        01  Addition of File 004, which corresponds to File      *
//*            006 of the regular CBT Tape, and which contains      *
//*            a pds in IEBUPDTE SYSIN format.  This pds has        *
//*            tools to manipulate the File 001 documentation.      *
//*            Included is the CBTUPD assembler program, which      *
//*            puts ./ ADD cards into this documentation, to        *
//*            break it up into a partitioned dataset, in the       *
//*            same way as I maintain it.                           *

//*        02  Update to File 008, which is a load module library   *
//*            that corresponds to File 035 of the regular CBT      *
//*            tape, and which has the REVIEW program from File     *
//*            135 of the regular CBT Tape in it also, and the      *
//*            SHOWMVS program.                                     *
//*                                                                 *
//*        03  Update to File 040, which contains PDS Version 8.5   *
//*            from John Kalinich.  This file has been updated to   *
//*            the "shipment 9" level, PDS85U9.                     *
//*                                                                 *
//*        04  Update to File 103, which contains documentation     *
//*            for other free tapes, to reflect the latest levels   *
//*            we have, as of this release time.                    *
//*                                                                 *
//*        05  Addition of File 240, which was moved from File 052  *
//*            of the regular CBT Tape, and which contains the poem *
//*            called "MVS Is Breaking My Heart".  This epic work   *
//*            was written in 1975, when the then new MVS had a     *
//*            lot of problems.  Fun to read for us old-timers.     *
//*                                                                 *
//*        06  Addition of File 241 which contains SPY and CONSOLE  *
//*            for MVS/XA 2.2.0, and which came from File 068 of    *
//*            the regular CBT Tape.                                *
//*                                                                 *
//*        07  Addition of File 242, which contains Amdahl dump     *
//*            exits to additionally format MVS/370 dumps.  This    *
//*            file was moved from File 123 of the regular CBT      *
//*            Tape, because with the approach of the Year 2000,    *
//*            I figure that this won't be of so much use, and I    *
//*            had to make room on the regular CBT Tape for other   *
//*            things.                                              *
//*                                                                 *
//*        08  Addition of File 243, which was moved from File 155  *
//*            of the regular CBT Tape.  This file contains an MVS  *
//*            Tuning Report from SHARE in 1983, and I think it is  *
//*            a bit old.                                           *
//*                                                                 *
//*        09  Addition of File 244, which contains QUEUE for MVS   *
//*            ESA 4.2 and 4.3.  Since this QUEUE doesn't work      *
//*            properly for MVS/ESA 5.2 and OS/390 JES2 levels,     *
//*            I figured it was time to archive it here.  This      *
//*            version came from File 391 of the regular CBT Tape.  *
//*                                                                 *
//*        10  Addition of Files 247 thru 249, which were moved     *

//*    Many of the files on this tape are created using the Yale    *
//*    OFFLOAD program (File 093).  When the OFFLOAD program finds  *
//*    data records in a pds that look like IEBUPDTE control cards  *
//*    (i.e.  './' ) it substitues a >< for an ' ./ '.              *

//*    I currently use the LISTPDS program nowadays instead of      *
//*    OFFLOAD.  Note that the LISTPDS program from File 316 can    *
//*    do the same thing, and it can also preserve ISPF stats in    *
//*    the control card.  The ISPF stats can be restored using      *
//*    the PDSLOAD program from File 093.  OFFLOAD and PDSLOAD      *
//*    have recently been modified by Greg Price to have paired     *
//*    functionality, and OFFLOAD will also produce ISPF stats in   *
//*    the "IEBUPDTE" control cards if they existed for the pds     *

//*           THE FOLLOWING IS A COMMENT FROM MR ARTHUR TANSKY      *

//*           ARE SELDOM USED (SUCH AS THE ADDRESS).  BUT THIS      *
//*           DOES NOT SAVE TOO MUCH.  THE REAL SAVINGS COMES       *
//*           WHEN YOU GET RID OF THE //* AT THE BEGINNING OF       *
//*           EACH LINE AND ESPECIALLY THE * AT THE END OF EACH     *
//*           LINE.  YOU CAN USE SPF TO COPY THE DATASET TO A VB    *
//*           FILE.  THE FILE TAKES UP 34  3380 TRACKS (BLOCKED     *
//*           AT 9040) IN FIXED FORMAT AND ONLY 20 TRACKS VB AT     *
//*           9076.  THIS SAVINGS OF 14 TRACKS ALSO TRANSLATES      *
//*           TO CPU-TIME AND REAL-TIME WHEN SEARCHING THE FILE,    *
//*           IN THAT THERE ARE THAT MANY LESS BYTES TO SEARCH.     *
//*           MR TANSKY'S CALCULATIONS SHOW A 40% SAVINGS.          *
//*                                                                 *
//*           WE, HOWEVER, WILL NOT CHANGE THE FILE, SINCE          *

//*           The official name of this program is CBT973, and      *

//*           up to ASSEMBLE and LOAD the CBT973 program with       *
//*           every run.  When you customize a copy of File 003     *
//*           for yourself, you might use your own linkedited       *
//*           copy of the load module, and not have to assemble     *
//*           it for every run.                                     *

//*           The program called CBTUPD is for the purpose of       *
//*           introducing appropriately named ./ ADD NAME= cards    *
//*           into strategic places of the CBT Tape Documentation.  *
//*           The CBT Tape doc can then be conveniently broken      *
//*           up into a pds.  The member names of the pds are       *
//*           in collating sequence order (EBCDIC), so that the     *
//*           members can be put back together as a sequential      *
//*           file, in their proper order.                          *
//*                                                                 *
//*           The program called DOCFILE is from Arnold Casinghino  *
//*           and it puts the indicators in columns 73-80 of the    *
//*           CBT Tape documentation, to indicate your current      *
//*           position within the documentation.                    *
//*                                                                 *
//*           The original idea of the DOCFILE program is from      *
//*           a COBOL program written by Sam Barr of Northrop.      *
//*                                                                 *
//*           DOCFILE has been updated by Sam Golob (03/99) to      *
//*           take into account the fact that there may be lower    *
//*           case characters in the CBT Tape Documentation         *
//*           nowadays.                                             *
//*                                                                 *
//*    Note:  This file also contains copies of the ISPF Edit       *
//*           Macros  CBTUPDTE  and  COVUPDTE, which are used       *
//*           to introduce ./ ADD NAME= cards into the CBT Tape     *
//*           and CBT Overflow Tape documentation files.  That      *
//*           will allow them to be converted into partitioned      *
//*           datasets, using IEBUPDTE ,PARM=NEW , or PDSLOAD       *
//*           programs.                                             *
//*                                                                 *
//*           However, the CBTUPD assembler program supersedes      *
//*           these two edit macros, because it is more accurate    *
//*           in checking where to insert the ./ ADD cards,         *
//*           and is less prone to some other errors.               *
//*                                                                 *
//*           As of CBTUPD Version 1.3 (or higher), the changes     *
//*           for each version of the tape are separated out as     *
//*           distinct members, sorted in reverse order.  None of   *
//*           the edit macros did that job, so CBTUPD is distinctly *
//*           better than the CBTUPDTE edit macro.                  *
//*                                                                 *
//*           Version 1.3 of the CBTUPD program was developed and   *
//*           tested on the IBM PC using the Tachyon Cross          *

//***FILE 006 is a tape copy program from the Air Force Finance     *
//*           Center in Denver.  This pgm will copy all files of    *
//*           an input tape to one to ten output tapes.  The        *
//*           original purpose of this program was for copying      *
//*           the SHARE MVS Mods Tape.  This program is quite       *
//*           fast.  The name of this program is "COPYMODS".        *
//*                                                                 *
//*           I USE THIS PROGRAM FOR CREATING COPIES OF THE CBT     *
//*           MVS UTILITIES TAPE.  (SG 10/93)                       *
//*                                                                 *
//*           This program is useful in making "carbon copies"      *
//*           from one tape to another, and it can also convert     *
//*           from one tape medium to another.  For example, it     *
//*           can convert from reels to cartridges, or vice-versa.  *
//*                                                                 *
//*           My advice is, however, that you should not mix        *
//*           media types when you make multiple output tapes in    *
//*           one run.  For example, //OUT1 and //OUT2 should       *
//*           both be reels, or both cartridges of the same         *
//*           format (like 3480, 3490IDRC, or 3490E).  Do not mix   *
//*           these.  //IN can be different from //OUTx, however.   *
//*           It is my experience that when the //IN (input tape)   *
//*           was of different media type than the //OUTx (output   *
//*           tapes), this program has always worked flawlessly     *
//*           to convert the tape to a different media format.      *
//*                                                                 *
//*           I believe the limit blocksize is 32768.  Do not       *
//*           depend on this to copy FDR tapes with big block       *
//*           sizes.  However, there's nothing stopping you from    *
//*           experimenting, as long as you don't depend on the     *
//*           results.                                              *
//*                                                                 *
//*           There is one more caveat.  If you use this program    *
//*           to copy a Standard Labeled (SL) tape, it will copy    *
//*           the labels and all the files.  However if one of the  *
//*           SL files has no data content, then COPYMODS does not  *
//*           properly recognize the condition, and stops at the    *
//*           "empty" SL file, thinking it's a double tape mark.    *
//*           This condition will happen if the SL tape file is an  *
//*           IEBCOPY unload of a pds with no members.              *
//*                                                                 *
//*           I'd like someone to fix this last problem.  If you    *
//*           have fixed this problem, or any other problem with    *
//*           COPYMODS, such as allowing it to copy tapes with big  *
//*           block sizes, please send the source code back to      *
//*           me at sbgolob@ibm.net  or  sbgolob@aol.com.  Thanks.  *

//*           if at density 6250 bpi), on the CBT Tapes.            *
//*                                                                 *
//***FILE 010 CONTAINS SEVERAL PROGRAMS USED FOR MANIPULATION OF    *
//*           THE CBT TAPE AND CBT OVERFLOW TAPE DOCUMENTATION.     *
//*                                                                 *
//*           The program called CBTUPD is for the purpose of       *
//*           introducing appropriately named ./ ADD NAME= cards    *
//*           into strategic places of the CBT Tape Documentation.  *
//*           The CBT Tape doc can then be conveniently broken      *
//*           up into a pds.  The member names of the pds are       *
//*           in collating sequence order (EBCDIC), so that the     *
//*           members can be put back together as a sequential      *
//*           file, in their proper order.                          *
//*                                                                 *
//*           The program called DOCFILE is from Arnold Casinghino  *
//*           and it puts the indicators in columns 73-80 of the    *
//*           CBT Tape documentation, to indicate your current      *
//*           position within the documentation.                    *
//*                                                                 *
//*           The original idea of the DOCFILE program is from      *
//*           a COBOL program written by Sam Barr of Northrop.      *
//*                                                                 *
//*           DOCFILE has been updated by Sam Golob (03/99) to      *
//*           take into account the fact that there may be lower    *
//*           case characters in the CBT Tape Documentation         *
//*           nowadays.                                             *
//*                                                                 *
//*    Note:  This file also contains copies of the ISPF Edit       *
//*           Macros  CBTUPDTE  and  COVUPDTE, which are used       *
//*           to introduce ./ ADD NAME= cards into the CBT Tape     *
//*           and CBT Overflow Tape documentation files.  That      *
//*           will allow them to be converted into partitioned      *
//*           datasets, using IEBUPDTE ,PARM=NEW , or PDSLOAD       *
//*           programs.                                             *

//*           However, the CBTUPD assembler program supersedes      *
//*           these two edit macros, because it is more accurate    *
//*           in checking where to insert the ./ ADD cards,         *
//*           and is less prone to some other errors.               *

//*           CAN BE UNDERSTOOD.  IF YOU ARE STILL STUCK WITH       *

//*           CAPABILITIES.  PDS, IN LINE MODE, CAN BE RUN FROM     *

//*           FUNCTIONS OF PDS STILL WORK.  THEREFORE, YOU CAN      *
//*           EXPAND THE DIRECTORY OF A PDS, COPY MEMBERS FROM      *
//*           ONE PDS TO ANOTHER, ETC ETC, WITHOUT JES2 OR JES3     *
//*           AND WITHOUT TSO BEING UP.  THIS MAKES FOR A GREAT     *
//*           RECOVERY TOOL.  PLEASE EXPLORE THIS WHILE YOUR        *
//*           SYSTEM IS HEALTHY, AND HAVE THE MECHANISMS IN PLACE.  *

//*              THIS SAVES A LOT OF COPYING OF PTF NUMBERS FROM    *

//*              USING THESE PROGRAMS IS EASY, ALTHOUGH THERE ARE A *
//*              FEW TRICKS.  INPUT IS A COPY OF YOUR SMP LISTING   *

//*        --------------- TLMS/RACF INTERFACE -----------------    *
//*         --> THIS CODE HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED UNDER RACF V1R2      *
//*         AND V1R3 WITH NO MAJOR CHANGES FOR 3-4 YEARS. NO        *
//*         RACF RELEASE DEPENDANCIES BEYOND RELEASE 1 VERSION      *
//*         2 (TAPEVOL SUPPORT) ARE KNOWN.                          *
//*                                                                 *
//*         --> THE FOLLOWING JOB WILL CREATE AN IEBUPDTE FORMAT    *
//*         FILE ON TAPE, THEN PRINT IT. THE FILE ADDS THREE        *
//*         MEMBERS TO A DATASET (ICHRTX01, ICHRTX02, TLMSBYDSP)    *

//*         MEMBERS=(TLMSDSPF,TLMBMASS,TLMSCTL,TLMBUPDA). THESE     *
//*         UPDATES ARE INTENDED TO FIT ON TLMS VERSION 2 REL.      *
//*         3 (V2R3) AS SHIPPED FROM TLMS(BEFORE CAPEX??). ANY      *
//*         RESEQUENCING OF THE MODULES IN QUESTION WILL MEAN A     *
//*         RE-EXAMINATION OF THESE HOOKS.                          *
//*                                                                 *
//*         --> SUPPORT IS ADDED FOR PROTECT=YES AND ADSP USERS     *
//*         TO HAVE TLMS ADD DSN INFO TO THE TAPE PROFILE,          *
//*         REMEMBER THAT THE TAPE IS RACF PROTECTED, AND           *
//*         AUTOMATICALLY REMOVE RACF PROTECTION WHEN THE TAPE      *
//*         IS RETURNED TO THE SCRATCH POOL. "GRPACC" AND RACF      *
//*         NAMING CONVENTIONS ARE ALSO FULLY SUPPORTED.            *
//*         ***NOTE*** THIS CODE WILL MEAN THAT TLMS AND RACF       *
//*         ARE ALWAYS IN SYNC... THIS CAN CAUSE CONSIDERABLE       *
//*         CONFUSION FOR USERS OF TOSS(TAPE OFF-SITE STORAGE)      *
//*         WHO USE GENERATION DATA GROUPS. THE SYSTEM CATALOG      *
//*         IS NOT NECESSARILY IN SYNC WITH RACF AND TLMS IF THE    *
//*         JOB CYCLES AND NUMBER OF GENERATIONS DO NOT MATCH       *
//*         THE TOSS SPECIFICATIONS. THIS CAUSES CONFUSION IN       *
//*         ATTEMPTING TO VERIFY CORRECT OPERATION, (IN AN          *
//*         ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE TLMS,CATALOG, AND RACF LISTINGS),    *
//*         BUT TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE NO PROBLEMS EXIST.      *
//*                                                                 *
//*         --> TAPE LIBRARIANS GENERALLY WILL NEED NO KNOWLEDGE    *
//*         OF ANY RACF ADDITIONS TO TLMS PROCESSING EXCEPT IN      *
//*         THE CASE WHERE A TAPE WHICH HAS BEEN SCRATCHED IS TO    *
//*         BE MARKED NON-SCRATCH. TO PROPERLY ADD RACF             *
//*         PROTECTION AT THIS POINT IS VERY DIFFICULT, AND IS      *
//*         BEST LEFT TO THE RACF ADMINISTRATOR IN CONJUNCTION      *
//*         WITH THE END-USER. NOTE THAT TO USE A TSO UPDATE TO     *
//*         THE MASTER FILE AND MARK A TAPE AS SCRATCH WITHOUT      *
//*         REMOVING THE RACF PROTECTION WILL CAUSE THE TAPE TO     *
//*         REMAIN RACF PROTECTED. THIS CAN CAUSE SEVERAL           *
//*         PROBLEMS. NOTE THAT THE PROGRAMS WHICH USE SCRATCH      *
//*         FUNCTIONS WILL REQUIRE APF AUTHORIZATION, AND HENCE     *
//*         WILL LIKELY BE RESTRICTED TO BATCH USAGE UNLESS         *
//*         SPECIAL ACTION IS TAKEN.                                *
//*                                                                 *
//*         ---> ONE MODIFICATION IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. IN THE     *
//*         ICHRTX01 CODE, IF NAMING CONVENTIONS ARE NOT            *
//*         FOLLOWED, A U485 ABEND RESULTS. NO PARTICULARLY         *
//*         VALUABLE REGISTER INFORMATION IS PRESENT, AND NO WTO    *
//*         IS ISSUED. IF IMS IS USED THE U485 CAN BE CONFUSED      *
//*         WITH AN IMS ABEND, WITH WILD GOOSE CHASES RESULTING.    *
//*         I WOULD SUGGEST A SIMPLE WTO BE ADDED BEFORE ABENDING   *
//*         ANY USER, AND PERHAPS CHANGE THE U485 ABEND TO A MORE   *
//*         APPROPRIATE ABEND.                                      *
//*                                                                 *
//*         ---> NOTE THAT NO NAMING CONVENTION EXITS ARE IN USE    *
//*         WITH THIS CODE, (NONE WERE REQUIRED), AND HENCE I       *
//*         CANNOT COMMENT ON WHAT CHANGES MAY BE REQUIRED IF       *
//*         NAMING CONVENTIONS ARE A PROBLEM. I CAN NOTE THAT       *
//*         NAMING CONVENTIONS ARE CHECKED INSIDE ICHRTX01 IN       *
//*         THE SAME MANNER THAT THEY ARE CHECKED IN THE RACF       *
//*         CODE, BUT THAT NO EFFORT WAS INVESTED IN PROVIDING A    *
//*         NAMING CONVENTION "HOOK". FOR USERS OF OTHER RACF       *
//*         EXITS, A WORD OF CAUTION: FOR SOME REASON (UNKNOWN      *
//*         BUT DEFINATELY ILL-CONCEIVED) I MANAGED TO MOVE THE     *
//*         ADDRESS OF THE IOSWA (IOS WORK AREA) FROM REGISTER 4    *
//*         (WHEN TLMS IS INVOKED) TO REGISTER 3. THIS REGISTER     *
//*         IS THE KEY TO FINDING DATASET NAMES AND OTHER GOOD      *
//*         INFO IN ALL RACF EXITS I HAVE SEEN.  IF YOU INTEND      *
//*         TO USE THIS CODE IN CONJUNCTION WITH A MODELLING        *
//*         EXIT WHICH WILL ACT ON TAPE PROFILES, THE EXIT WILL     *
//*         LIKELY EXPECT R4 TO POINT TO THE IOSWA AT THE TIME      *
//*         THAT "RACDEF" IS ISSUED.  SINCE THE "RACDEF" IS         *
//*         ALWAYS ISSUED FROM HERE FOR TAPES (THE PROTECT=YES      *
//*         FLAG IS OFF BY THE TIME OF THE SYSTEM "RACDEF") I       *
//*         WOULD SUGGEST THAT THIS REGISTER ASSIGNMENT BE          *
//*         CHANGED...MY APOLOGIES.                                 *

//*       EXECUTE 'AFOX00', NOT 'IFOX00'.  AFTER YOU ARE SATISFIED  *
//*       THAT IS WORKING, YOU MAY WANT TO APPLY THE ZAPS TO        *
//*       'IFOX00' TOO. (THIS IS SIMPLER THAN DELETING IFOX00       *
//*       AND RENAMING AFOX00 TO IFOX00, BECAUSE IFOX00 HAS         *
//*       ALIASES OF 'ASMBLR' AND 'IEUASM').                        *

//*       IF YOU CHOOSE TO APPLY THE ZAPS TO 'IFOX00' ITSELF,       *
//*       THAT IS UP TO YOU.  IF YOU PREFER NOT TO DO THAT, YOU     *
//*       CAN STILL USE 'AFOX00', BECAUSE IT DOES NOT INTERFERE     *
//*       WITH THE UNMODIFIED 'IFOX00' AT ALL, EVEN IF THEY ARE     *
//*       BOTH IN THE SAME LOAD LIBRARY.                            *

//*    TO COMPARE THE CODE WITH THE CURRENT IBM SOURCE              *
//*    (ON MICROFICHE FOR EXAMPLE), CHANGE THE 'SETB'               *
//*    FOR &MACREF TO ZERO (IN IFOX0F AND XDICT) AND ASSEMBLE.      *
//*    THIS WILL PRODUCE AN ASSEMBLY WITHOUT THE MODIFICATIONS,     *

//*    'CATPTPCH'. I OBTAINED IT FROM THE OS/MVT PROJECT TAPE       *
//*    WHEN I WAS ON OS/MVT. IT WILL ALLOW YOU TO OFFLOAD YOUR      *
//*    OS CATALOGS IN IEHPROGM PROGRAM FORMAT CONTROL CARDS. IT     *
//*    DOES ALL THE BLDG'S ETC NECESSARY TO REBUILD THE CATALOG.    *
//*    TRUE THERE ARE NICE NEAT PROGRAMS TO DO COPIES OF            *
//*    CATALOGS ETC.  BUT THERE IS JUST SOMETHING THAT GIVES YOU    *
//*    A WARM FEELING IN THE BOTTOM OF YOUR STOMACH WHEN YOU CAN    *
//*    SEE THE CATALOG REPRODUCED IN IEHPROGM CONTROL CARDS.        *
//*                                                                 *
//*     WE HAVE ADDED THE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR ALL 3330           *
//*     DEVICES 3350'S. IT HAS SOME OTHER FUNCTIONS THAT ARE        *
//*     EXPLAINED IN THE MEMBER $DOC. THE CODE IS IN THE FORM       *
//*     OF MACROS AND I HAVE PUT A MEMBER CALLED $INSTALL TO        *
//*     DEMONSTRATE THE JCL REQUIRED FOR AN ASSEMBLY.  I WANT       *
//*     TO THANK DARRELL WILCOX OF KING COUNTY SYSTEMS FOR THE      *

//*      AS AN ADDED WORD HERE. I BELIEVE YOU WILL SEE THE SYSTEM   *
//*      ON THE MACRO FOR GENERATING THE CODE. WHEN IT WAS          *
//*      ORIGINALLY CODED I THINK 'SYSTEM=370' MEANT TO INCLUDE     *
//*      370 INSTRUCTIONS.  I TRIED THE CODE AND IT BLEW. SO I      *
//*      INTEND THE MEANING TO BE 'SYSTEM=360' TO BE FOR OS/MVT     *
//*      ON 360'S AND 370'S. AND 'SYSTEM=370' TO MEAN OS/MVS. I     *
//*      HAVE ONLY DONE THE FUNCTIONS TO PRINT THE CATALOG OFF OR   *

//*      PAGEPLOT IS A COLLECTION OF SUBROUTINES USED TO            *
//*      GENERATE COMPUTER GRAPHICS ON PRINTERS WHICH USE           *
//*      SOFTWARE GENERATED CHARACTER SETS.  THE SYSTEM WAS         *
//*      DEVELOPED TO SUPPORT THE USE OF THE IBM 3800 AND XEROX     *
//*      9700 LASER PRINTERS AS GRAPHICS DEVICES DRIVEN BY THE      *
//*      SAS/GRAPH SYSTEM.  THE INTERFACE WITH SAS, WHICH IS        *
//*      KNOWN AS THE UNIVERSAL DEVICE DRIVER, ALLOWS THE           *
//*      IMPLEMENTATION OF GRAPHICS DEVICE DRIVERS FROM             *
//*      CALCOMP-COMPATIBLE GRAPHICS SUBROUTINES PROVIDED BY        *
//*      THE USER.  THE TERM CALCOMP-COMPATIBLE REFERS TO THE       *
//*      CALLING SEQUENCES DEFINED IN "BASIC SOFTWARE FOR           *
//*      ELECTROMECHANICAL PLOTTERS", PUBLISHED BY CALIFORNIA       *
//*      COMPUTER PRODUCTS INC (CALCOMP).  THE PAGEPLOT             *
//*      SUBROUTINES USE THESE CONVENTIONS, TO THE EXTENT           *
//*      REQUIRED BY SAS/GRAPH, BUT THE LIBRARY DOES NOT            *
//*      INCLUDE EVERY ROUTINE DEFINED BY CALCOMP.  THE             *
//*      PAGEPLOT SOFTWARE MAY BE COMBINED WITH SUBROUTINES         *
//*      FROM ANOTHER GRAPHICS PACKAGE TO PRODUCE A COMPLETE        *
//*      IMPLEMENTATION.  IN ADDITION TO THE GRAPHICS               *
//*      SUBROUTINES, THE PACKAGE REQUIRES THE USE OF A SPECIAL     *
//*      CHARACTER SET.  THIS CHARACTER SET IS BASED ON THE         *
//*      EBCDIC STANDARD BUT INCLUDES A NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL        *
//*      CHARACTERS USED SPECIFICALLY FOR GRAPHICS.  THE            *
//*      CHARACTER SETS FOR THE IBM 3800 AND XEROX 9700 ARE         *
//*      GENERATED BY SPECIAL PURPOSE SOFTWARE AND MUST BE          *
//*      PERMANENTLY INSTALLED IN THE PRINTER FONT LIBRARY.         *
//*      PAGEPLOT GRAPHICS ARE GENERATED BY THE GRAPHICS            *
//*      SUBROUTINES AND PRINTED ON THE TARGET DEVICE USING         *
//*      THIS SPECIAL CHARACTER SET.                                *
//*                                                                 *

//*      --------                                                   *
//*      THE BASIC CONCEPT BEHIND PAGEPLOT IS THE                   *
//*      SOFTWARE-GENERATED GRAPHICS CHARACTER SET WHICH            *
//*      SIMULATES A RASTER-SCAN GRAPHICS DISPLAY.  EACH PLOT       *
//*      REQUIRES ONE PRINTER PAGE, WHICH IS FILLED WITH TEXT,      *
//*      SPECIAL SYMBOLS AND MOSAIC CHARACTERS.  THE AREA OF        *
//*      THE PLOTTING SURFACE IS DETERMINED FROM THE SIZE OF        *
//*      THE PRINTER FORM USED, WHILE THE RESOLUTION OF THE         *
//*      IMAGE DEPENDS UPON THE SIZE OF CHARACTERS USED.  EACH      *
//*      PAGE IS TREATED AS A MATRIX OF CHARACTER CELLS AND IS      *
//*      FILLED BY CALLS TO THE PLOT AND SYMBOL SUBROUTINES.  A     *
//*      SEPARATE IMAGE IS MAINTAINED BY EACH OF THESE              *
//*      ROUTINES.  THE PLOT IMAGE IS FORMED FROM MOSAIC            *
//*      CHARACTERS, WHICH CONSIST OF SIX RECTANGULAR PIXELS        *
//*      ARRANGED IN TWO COLUMNS.  SIXTY-FOUR MOSAIC CHARACTERS     *
//*      ARE USED REPRESENT ALL COMBINATIONS OF THE SIX PIXELS.     *
//*      THE SYMBOL ROUTINE BUILDS AN IMAGE FROM TEXT               *
//*      CHARACTERS AND CENTRED GRAPHICS SYMBOLS.  AT THE           *
//*      COMPLETION OF EVERY PLOT, THE TEXT IMAGE IS MERGED         *
//*      ONTO THE MOSAIC ONE, WITH NON-BLANK TEXT CHARACTERS        *
//*      ERASING OVERLAID MOSAICS.  THE COMPLETED PLOT IS THEN      *
//*      WRITTEN OUT TO AN EXTERNAL PRINT FILE AND PRINTED ON       *
//*      THE TARGET DEVICE USING THE PAGEPLOT GRAPHICS              *
//*      CHARACTER SET.                                             *
//*                                                                 *

//*      THE DYNAMIC MONITOR SYSTEM MONITORS THE INTERACTIONS       *

//*      DYNAMICALLY ACTIVATED EVENT HANDLING ROUTINES. A           *
//*      STANDARD SET OF EVENT HANDLING ROUTINES IS AVAILABLE.      *
//*      THIS ROUTINE PERFORMS AN EVENT TRACE FUNCTION.  DMS        *
//*      WAS DEVELOPED SPECIFICALLY TO ANALYZE THE I/O              *
//*      ACTIVITIES OF AN IBM/OS 370 MVS-AP SYSTEM.  A              *
//*      PRINCIPAL DESIGN GOAL FOR DMS IS TO KEEP THE CPU           *
//*      OVERHEAD AND STORAGE REQUIREMENTS BELOW AN ACCEPTABLE      *
//*      THRESHOLD, SO IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO MONITOR AN ENTIRE     *
//*      TP NETWORK DURING THE ENTIRE ONLINE OPERATION.  IN         *
//*      ADDITION, DMS GIVES THE SYSTEM PROGRAMMER A CONVENIENT     *
//*      MEANS OF WRITING SIMPLE PROGRAMS CONTAINING BOTH           *
//*      SELECTION AND DECISION LOGIC WHICH CAN BE BASED ON A       *
//*      SELECTED GROUP OF SYSTEM EVENTS.  THE TIME STAMP FROM      *
//*      THE TIME OF DAY CLOCK GIVES THE POSSIBILTY TO CREATE       *
//*      REPRODUCIBLE TIME MEASUREMENTS.  DMS IS A HELPFUL TOOL     *
//*      FOR PROBLEM DETERMINATION.                                 *

//*     WERE OBTAINED FROM MY OS/MVT DAYS AND CONVERTED.            *
//*     IT'S EMBARRASSING TO TELL MANAGEMENT THAT USERS HAVE        *
//*     LOST FUNCTIONS MIGRATING TO MVS. HOPEFULLY I CAN            *

//*    THE FILE IS CONSTRUCTED OF MEMBERS AS FOLLOWS: THE           *
//*    SOURCE IS PUT IN AS A NAME, THEN THE HELP IS SUFFIXED        *
//*    WITH A # SIGN, AND THE THE JCL TO INSTALL IS SUFFIXED        *

//*     NOTE:                                                       *
//*     MANY OF THESE MODULES HAVE THE CSECT STACKED                *
//*     TOGETHER, LOOK AT THE JCL INSTALL MEMBER TO SEE IF          *
//*     THERE A 'PARM=BATCH' IN COMPILE. IF YOU ONLY HAVE           *
//*     ASMF THEN YOU MAY HAVE TO BREAK THE CODE APART SINCE        *
//*     ASMF DOES NOT SUPPORT BATCH COMPILES !                      *
//*                                                                 *
//*     NOTE:                                                       *
//*     MANY OF THESE WILL RUN AS IS UNDER MVT, SOME HAVE A         *
//*     COMPILE CODE THAT LETS YOU SET IT FOR MVS OR MVT.           *
//*     NEAT!                                                       *
//*                                                                 *
//*     NOTE:                                                       *
//*     IF YOU INSTALL A COMD WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE CODE,          *
//*     AND IF TRY TO USE IT, IT MAY COME BACK WITH '               *
//*     COMMAND NOT FOUND '.  IT IS PROBABLY BECAUSE WE HAVE        *
//*     SOME CHECKING FOR SECURITY THAT LOOKS AT THE TSOID.         *
//*     THEREFORE IF IT ISN'T A MATCH WE XCTL TO THE SAME           *
//*     MODULE THAT WILL YIELD 'COMMAND NOT FOUND' CONFUSES         *
//*     THE HECK OUT OF PEOPLE WHO OVERHEAR A WORD AND ARE          *
//*     SLICK ENOUGH TO COPY THE CMD ELSEWHERE !!!!!                *
//*                                                                 *
//*     NOTE:                                                       *
//*     THE JCL YOU MAY SEE IN THE INSTALLATION OF THE TSO          *
//*     CP'S MAY LOOK STRANGE. ALL IT IS BASICALLY THE              *
//*     COMPILE AND LKED STEPS (ASMFCL OR ASMHCL). IT MAY           *
//*     LOOK A BIT DIFFERENT BUT IT IS REALLY NOT. WE HAVE          *
//*     AN IBM 3800 AND ROTATE THE PRINT. THAT IS WHY THE           *
//*     PROC IS DIFFERENT FROM THE STANDARD.  THE MOST              *
//*     IMPORTANT PART OF THE JCL IS TO SEE WHAT MEMBERS ARE        *
//*     INPUTTED AND THE LKED EDIT ATTRIBUTES OF THE MODULE.        *
//*                                                                 *
//*     NOTE:                                                       *
//*     IF YOU INSTALL THE TSO SUBCOMMANDS OF EDIT, YOU             *
//*     SHOULD READ THE TSO SPL. WE CALLED OUR MODULES              *
//*     IKJXXXXX NOT TO MEAN THESE ARE IBM MODULES BUT TO           *
//*     IDENTITY THEM TO US AS TSO CP'S OF EDIT. ALSO               *
//*     REMEMBER YOU HAVE TO UPDATE 'IKJEBMA9' EDIT                 *
//*     SUBCOMMAND TABLE. READ THE SPL ON IT. IT IS                 *
//*     CONFUSING BECAUSE A SUBCMD CAN HAVE MANY NAMES AND          *
//*     DO NOT HAVE TO MATCH THE MEMBER NAME IN THE LOAD            *
//*     MODULE LIBRARY.  DO NOT PANIC IF IT LOOKS LIKE              *
//*     MAGIC, JUST GO TO THE SPL.                                  *
//*                                                                 *

//*          RENTLY  HAS THE  LARGEST EXTENT  OF CONTIGUOUS  FREE   *
//*          SPACE.  A PRIMARY ALLOCATION OF ONE TRACK AND A SEC-   *
//*          ONDARY ALLOCATION OF ONE  TRACK ARE SPECIFIED, ALONG   *
//*          WITH FIVE DIRECTORY BLOCKS.   THIS IS GENERALLY SUF-   *
//*          FICIENT SPACE FOR MOST SPF PROFILE SPECIFICATIONS.     *
//*                                                                 *
//*      C.  THE DEFAULT DATASET NAMES RECOGNIZED BY GDA FOR CER-   *
//*          TAIN  DDNAMES HAVE  BEEN  CHANGED.  PREVIOUSLY,  THE   *
//*          DEPARTMENT OF  ENERGY HAD  MAINTAINED THE  "VANILLA"   *
//*          IBM-SUPPLIED    PANEL    LIBRARIES    FOR    SPF/PDF   *
//*          (ISR.V1R1M0.ISRPLIB)   AND   THE    DIALOG   MANAGER   *
//*          (ISP.V1R1M0.ISPPLIB), PLUS A STANDARD DOE-WIDE PANEL   *
//*          LIBRARY (SYS1.SPF.PLIB),  ALL OF WHICH  WERE CONCAT-   *
//*          ENATED  TOGETHER UNDER  THE  NAME ISPPLIB.   SIMILAR   *
//*          GROUPS  OF   LIBRARIES  WERE   MAINTAINED  FOR   THE   *
//*          MESSAGES,  SKELETON AND  TABLE  LIBRARIES, AND  THIS   *
//*          COMPLICATED  CONCATENATION   SCHEME  PROVED   TO  BE   *
//*          TIME-CONSUMING.                                        *
//*                                                                 *
//*          NONE  OF THE  LIBRARIES BEING  CONCATENATED UNDER  A   *
//*          SPECIFIC DDNAME CONTAINED ANY  MEMBER NAME CONFLICTS   *
//*          EXCEPT   FOR  THE   SPF/PDF   PRIMARY  OPTION   MENU   *
//*          (ISR@PRIM).   DOE  HAS   REPLACED  THE  IBM-SUPPLIED   *
//*          ISR@PRIM WITH A SLIGHTLY MODIFIED VERSION WHICH CON-   *
//*          TAINS  TWO ADDITIONAL  OPTIONS, ONE  FROM WHICH  ALL   *
//*          DOE-WIDE STANDARD DIALOGS ARE ANCHORED, AND ONE FROM   *
//*          WHICH EACH USER MAY ANCHOR HIS/HER OWN DIALOGS.        *
//*                                                                 *
//*          THIS ALLOWED DOE  TO MERGE ALL THE  IBM-SUPPLIED AND   *
//*          DOE-SUPPLIED  PANELS INTO  A  SINGLE PANEL  LIBRARY,   *
//*          SYS1.SPF.PLIB, THU  SIMPLIFYING AND SPEEDING  UP THE   *
//*          ALLOCATION PROCESS.   SIMILAR CONSOLIDATIONS  OF THE   *
//*          MESSAGES,  SKELETON AND  TABLE  LIBRARIES WERE  PER-   *
//*          FORMED.                                                *
//*                                                                 *
//*          TWO SPIN-OFF ADVANTAGES TO  THIS TECHNIQUE RESULTED.   *
//*          FIRST,  THE  PROLIFERATION  OF  USER-UNIQUE  PRIMARY   *
//*          OPTION MENUS WAS ELIMINATED,  SINCE ALL USER DIALOGS   *
//*          COULD NOW  THE ANCHORED  FROM THE  USER DIALOGS  (U)   *
//*          OPTION ON THE DOE-SUPPLIED  PRIMARY OPTION MENU, AND   *
//*          ALL  DOE-SUPPLIED DIALOGS  (E.G.,  DIALOGS FOR  ABR,   *
//*          EASYTRIEVE,  GDDM,  PROCMAN,   LIBRARIAN,  PANAUDIT,   *
//*          ETC.) COULD BE ANCHORED FROM  THE SYSTEM DIALOGS (S)   *
//*          OPTION.                                                *
//*                                                                 *
//*          SECONDLY,   APPLICATION   OF  MAINTENANCE   TO   THE   *
//*          IBM-SUPPLIED LIBRARIES  WOULD NOT RESULT  IN ENQUEUE   *
//*          PROBLEMS  OR OVERLAY  OF  LOCALLY DEVELOPED  PANELS.   *
//*          ANY INSTALLATION WHICH HAS SPF AND THE DIALOG MANAG-   *
//*          ER  AND  HAS  NOT   SIMILARLY  GAINED  CONTROL  OVER   *
//*          USER-UNIQUE PRIMARY  OPTION MENUS  SHOULD HEED  THIS   *
//*          EXAMPLE CAREFULLY.  IT  HAS PROVEN TO BE  ONE OF THE   *
//*          BEST DECISIONS THAT DOE HAS EVER MADE.                 *
//*                                                                 *
//*  3.  IF GDA VERSION 2 IS APF  AUTHORIZED, IT WILL ISSUE SYSE-   *
//*      VENT 29 (DONTSWAP)  TO MARK ITSELF NON-SWAPPABLE  AT THE   *
//*      BEGINNING OF EXECUTION AND ISSUE SYSEVENT 2A (OKSWAP) TO   *
//*      MARK ITSELF SWAPPABLE AT THE  END OF EXECUTION.  IN MOST   *
//*      CASES,  THIS WILL  REDUCE  GDA  EXECUTION TIME.   DURING   *
//*      LOGON PROCESSING,  THIS CAN  BE A  SIGNIFICANT CONSIDER-   *
//*      ATION.                                                     *

//*      IT IS RECOGNIZED THAT SOME INSTALLATIONS MAY PREFER THAT   *
//*      THIS NOT  BE DONE.  THERE  IS NO OTHER  REQUIREMENT THAT   *
//*      GDA BE APF  AUTHORIZED.  HENCE, LINK EDITING  IT WITHOUT   *
//*      APF AUTHORIZATION OR OMITTING THE  COMMAND NAME FROM THE   *
//*      AUTHORIZED  COMMAND TABLE  (IKJEFTE2)  IN IKJEFT02  WILL   *
//*      DISABLE THIS FEATURE.                                      *

//*  THE GENERALIZED  DATASET ALLOCATOR  (GDA) DESCRIBED  IN THIS   *
//*  DOCUMENT IS  AN ASSEMBLER LANGUAGE  PROGRAM WHICH RUNS  AS A   *
//*  RE-ENTRANT TSO COMMAND PROCESSOR UNDER  THE IBM OS/VS2 (MVS)   *
//*  OPERATING SYSTEM.  ITS  PURPOSE IS TO ALLOW THE  TSO USER TO   *
//*  ALLOCATE A  LIST OF  DATASETS FOR SUBSEQUENT  USE BY  ONE OR   *
//*  MORE COMMAND PROCESSORS OR APPLICATION PROGRAMS.               *
//*                                                                 *
//*  GDA FUNCTIONS BY READING A SEQUENTIAL DATASET DESCRIBING THE   *
//*  DATASETS  TO BE  ALLOCATED.   THIS  SO-CALLED CONTROL  INPUT   *
//*  DATASET MAY  HAVE ANY  NUMBER OF  RECORDS OF  FOUR DIFFERENT   *
//*  TYPES.  THE RECORD TYPES ARE:                                  *
//*                                                                 *
//*  O   ALLOCATION REQUEST RECORDS                                 *

//*  O   TSO COMMAND RECORDS                                        *
//*                                                                 *

//*  O   DISPLAY RECORDS                                            *

//*  THE  RECORD TYPES  WILL  BE  DISCUSSED INDIVIDUALLY  AND  IN   *
//*  DETAIL BELOW.                                                  *
//*                                                                 *
//*  IN A  SENSE, GDA  FUNCTIONS MUCH LIKE  THE TSO  COMMAND LIST   *
//*  (CLIST) INTERPRETER, IN THAT IT  READS A CONTROL INPUT DATA-   *
//*  SET AND INTERPRETS AND ACTS ON EACH RECORD INDIVIDUALLY.  IT   *
//*  DIFFERS  FROM   A  TSO   CLIST,  HOWEVER,   IN  SYNTAX   AND   *
//*  PERFORMANCE, TAKING APPROXIMATELY 10 PER  CENT LESS CPU TIME   *
//*  TO PERFORM EACH GIVEN TASK  THAN DOES THE CLIST INTERPRETER.   *
//*  GDA  ALSO HAS  BUILT INTO  IT  CERTAIN SHORT-HAND  NOTATIONS   *
//*  WHICH ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO  CLIST PROGRAMMERS AND WHICH FORM   *
//*  A LARGE PART OF THE JUSTIFICATION FOR GDA.                     *
//*                                                                 *

//*  ALL TSO SESSIONS REQUIRE THAT  CERTAIN DATASETS BE ALLOCATED   *
//*  TO THE  SESSION FOR  SUBSEQUENT USE  BY COMMAND  PROCESSORS,   *
//*  CLISTS AND APPLICATION PROGRAMS.  THESE DATASETS MAY BE:       *
//*                                                                 *
//*  O   SCRATCH OR WORK DATASETS, WHICH ARE DELETED WHEN NO LON-   *
//*      GER REQUIRED OR AT LOGOFF TIME,                            *
//*                                                                 *
//*  O   NEW PERMANENT  DATASETS WHICH ARE  RETAINED INDEFINITELY   *
//*      BEYOND THE DURATION OF THE TSO SESSION IN WHICH THEY ARE   *
//*      CREATED, AND                                               *
//*                                                                 *
//*  O   PREVIOUSLY CREATED (EXISTING) PERMANENT DATASETS.          *
//*                                                                 *
//*  IT IS THIS  LAST CATEGORY THAT WE ARE  CONCERNED WITH.  MORE   *
//*  SPECIFICALLY, THE  SCOPE OF  THIS DOCUMENT  IS LIMITED  TO A   *
//*  CONSIDERATION OF THE PROBLEMS  ASSOCIATED WITH ALLOCATION OF   *
//*  EXISTING DATASETS  WHICH MUST  BE SHARED  AMONG SEVERAL  TSO   *
//*  SESSIONS.  IN THIS CONTEXT, WE  SHALL REFER TO SUCH DATASETS   *
//*  AS SHARED DATASETS.                                            *
//*                                                                 *
//*  SHARED DATASETS MAY BE ALLOCATED IN ANY OF FOUR WAYS:          *
//*                                                                 *
//*  O   DURING LOGON PROCESSING, VIA INCLUSION IN THE LOGON PRO-   *
//*      CEDURE OF A DD-CARD REFERRING TO THE DATASET,              *
//*                                                                 *
//*  O   DYNAMICALLY, BY THE TSO USER, VIA THE ALLOCATE COMMAND,    *
//*                                                                 *
//*  O   DYNAMICALLY, BY A CLIST, OR                                *
//*                                                                 *
//*  O   DYNAMICALLY, BY A COMMAND PROCESSOR.                       *
//*                                                                 *
//*  EACH OF THESE TECHNIQUES HAS  SOME DRAWBACKS ASSOCIATED WITH   *
//*  IT.  THE ALLOCATION OF DATASETS AT LOGON TIME BY INCLUDING A   *
//*  DD-CARD FOR EACH DATASET IN THE LOGON PROCEDURE IS THE METH-   *
//*  OD MOST PRONE TO DISASTER.  IT FREQUENTLY HAPPENS THAT, WHEN   *
//*  A PARTICULAR USER IS LOGGING ON TO TSO, ONE (OR MORE) OF THE   *
//*  DATASETS REFERRED TO IN THE  LOGON PROCEDURE HE/SHE IS USING   *
//*  IS NOT AVAILABLE AT THAT TIME.   THE REASONS MAY BE THAT THE   *
//*  VOLUME ON WHICH IT RESIDES IS  NOT MOUNTED, THAT THE DATASET   *
//*  IS BEING USED EXCLUSIVELY BY ANOTHER  TSO USER OR BATCH JOB,   *
//*  OR THAT THE DATASET HAS BEEN DELETED, EITHER ACCIDENTALLY OR   *
//*  INTENTIONALLY.  THESE SITUATIONS ARE NOT ALWAYS ERROR CONDI-   *
//*  TIONS.   EVEN THE  DELETION  OF THE  NEEDED  DATASET MAY  BE   *
//*  APPROPRIATE, UNDER  CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH  AS MIGRATION   *
//*  OF DATA, RECREATION OF A VOLUME, ETC.                          *
//*                                                                 *
//*  THE PROBLEM WITH INCLUSION OF THE DATASETS IN THE LOGON PRO-   *
//*  CEDURE IS THAT  WHENEVER ANY DATASET REFERRED TO  IN A LOGON   *
//*  PROCEDURE IS NOT  AVAILABLE, FOR ANY REASON,  ALL TSO LOGONS   *
//*  USING THAT PROCEDURE  WILL FAIL.  IF THE  DATASETS ARE TRULY   *
//*  ESSENTIAL  TO  THE  SESSION, THIS  MAY  BE  THE  APPROPRIATE   *
//*  RESPONSE.  BUT, MORE THAN LIKELY,  SOME TSO PROCESSING COULD   *
//*  BE PERFORMED WITHOUT  ONE OR MORE OF THE  DATASETS.  IN SUCH   *
//*  CASES, THE TSO LOGON PROCESS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO PROCEED.     *
//*                                                                 *
//*  ANOTHER DIFFICULTY  WITH INCLUSION  OF DATASETS  IN THE  TSO   *
//*  LOGON PROCEDURE  IS THAT  DIFFERENT USERS  REQUIRE DIFFERENT   *
//*  DATASETS.  IT  IS OFTEN DESIRABLE TO  HAVE AS MANY  USERS AS   *
//*  POSSIBLE  USING THE  SAME LOGON  PROCEDURE.  THIS  PRECLUDES   *
//*  ALLOCATION DURING LOGON OF  USER-SPECIFIC DATASETS, THAT IS,   *
//*  DATASETS BELONGING  TO A  SPECIFIC USER,  GROUP OF  USERS OR   *
//*  APPLICATION, SUCH  AS THOSE  THAT BEGIN  WITH THE  USERID OR   *
//*  SOME APPLICATION MODULE IDENTIFICATION CODE.                   *
//*                                                                 *
//*  WHERE DATASET  SECURITY PACKAGES SUCH  AS RACF OR  ACF-2 ARE   *
//*  INVOLVED, INCLUSION  OF USER-SPECIFIC DATASETS IN  THE LOGON   *
//*  PROCEDURE MAY  RESULT IN  SECURITY VIOLATIONS  DURING LOGON,   *
//*  AND SUBSEQUENT  TERMINATION OF THE  LOGON PROCESS.   THIS IS   *
//*  NOT A DESIRABLE SITUATION.                                     *
//*                                                                 *
//*  IT IS CLEAR THAT ALLOCATION  OF SHARED DATASETS BY INCLUSION   *
//*  OF DD-CARDS IN THE LOGON PROCEDURE IS NOT A VIABLE METHOD OF   *
//*  ALLOCATING USER-SPECIFIC DATASETS AND  IS A DANGEROUS METHOD   *
//*  OF ALLOCATING  SHARED DATASETS.  DYNAMIC ALLOCATION  OF SUCH   *
//*  DATASETS IS PREFERRED                                          *
//*                                                                 *
//*  DYNAMIC  ALLOCATION  BY  THE  USER,  VIA  THE  TSO  ALLOCATE   *
//*  COMMAND, HAS THE ADVANTAGE THAT IF ANY PARTICULAR ALLOCATION   *
//*  FAILS, THE USER  IS INFORMED, AND THE SESSION  IS NOT TERMI-   *
//*  NATED.   HOWEVER,  WHERE  A LARGE  NUMBER  OF  DATASETS  ARE   *
//*  INVOLVED, SUCH ALLOCATIONS MAY TAKE A LONG TIME FOR THE USER   *
//*  TO ENTER.                                                      *
//*                                                                 *
//*  THE CLIST  FACILITY IS A MEANS  BY WHICH THE USER  CAN ENTER   *
//*  THE COMMANDS  TO ALLOCATE THE  REQUIRED DATASETS  ONCE, SAVE   *
//*  THESE COMMANDS  IN A  DATASET, AND  SUBSEQUENTLY INVOKE  THE   *
//*  CLIST INTERPRETER TO READ THAT DATASET AND PERFORM THE ALLO-   *
//*  CATE COMMANDS FOR HIM.  THIS  TECHNIQUE HAS ONLY TWO SIGNIF-   *
//*  ICANT DISADVANTAGES.  THE CLIST INTERPRETER IS A SIGNIFICANT   *
//*  CONSUMER OF CPU  RESOURCES.  SECONDLY, THE USER  IS REQUIRED   *
//*  TO KNOW  AND TO ENTER INTO  HIS CLIST THE NAMES  OF STANDARD   *
//*  SYSTEM DATASETS, WHICH MAY NOT BE UNDER HIS CONTROL.           *
//*                                                                 *
//*  FOR EXAMPLE, LET US ASSUME THAT THE USER DEVELOPS A CLIST TO   *
//*  ALLOCATE THE  DATASETS REQUIRED  BY THE  PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT   *
//*  FACILITY (PDF).  PDF MAY REQUIRE  A LARGE NUMBER OF DATASETS   *
//*  FOR EXECUTION,  SOME OF  WHICH ARE  SYSTEM-MAINTAINED SHARED   *
//*  DATASETS, SUCH AS  THE COMMON PDF PANEL  LIBRARY, FROM WHICH   *
//*  PDF FETCHES THE PANELS TO BE  DISPLAYED AT THE USER'S TERMI-   *
//*  NAL.                                                           *
//*                                                                 *
//*  THE USER  MAY KEEP HIS  OWN COMPLETE  COPY OF THE  PDF PANEL   *
//*  LIBRARY, BUT THIS IS NOT  RECOMMENDED, SINCE THERE MORE THAN   *
//*  A HUNDRES  PANELS IN THIS LIBRARY,  AND THERE IS  SELDOM ANY   *
//*  REASON FOR EACH USER OF PDF TO HAVE AND MAINTAIN A COMPLETE,   *
//*  SEPARATE COPY OF SUCH A LARGE DATASET.  MORE OFTEN, THE USER   *
//*  WILL  SIMPLY USE  WHAT PDF  PROVIDES.  IN  EITHER CASE,  THE   *
//*  DATASET MUST BE  ALLOCATED UNDER THE FILE  NAME ISPPLIB.  AT   *
//*  PRESENT, THE PDF PANEL LIBRARY IS CALLED ISR.V1R1M0.ISRPLIB.   *
//*  THUS, THE USER WOULD HAVE TO CODE THE FOLLOWING COMMAND INTO   *
//*  HIS CLIST:                                                     *
//*                                                                 *
//*    ALLOC  FI(ISPPLIB)  DS('ISR.V1R1M0.ISRPLIB') SHR             *
//*                                                                 *
//*  BUT WHY  SHOULD THE  USER HAVE  TO REMEMBER  THIS CUMBERSOME   *
//*  NAME?  SUPPOSE A NEW RELEASE OF PDF WERE INSTALLED, AND THIS   *
//*  NEW  RELEASE  INCORPORATED  NEW DATASET  NAMES  AND/OR  FILE   *
//*  NAMES.  THE USER WOULD HAVE TO CHANGE HIS OWN CLIST IN ORDER   *
//*  TO KEEP UP  WITH SYSTEM MAINTENANCE.  IF THERE  WERE A LARGE   *
//*  COMMUNITY  OF  PDF USERS,  EACH  WITH  THEIR OWN  CLISTS  TO   *
//*  PRE-ALLOCATE  THE  REQUIRED DATASETS,  HOW  MUCH  CONVERSION   *
//*  WOULD BE REQUIRED IN ORDER TO  INSTALL A NEW RELEASE OF PDF,   *
//*  OR SIMPLY TO RENAME ONE OF ITS DATASETS?  THIS IS INCONSIST-   *
//*  ENT WITH  THE PHILOSOPHY OF  ISOLATING THE USER  FROM SYSTEM   *
//*  MAINTENANCE ACTIVITIES.                                        *
//*                                                                 *
//*  MULTIPLY THIS BY THE MYRIAD NUMBER OF OTHER, SIMILAR COMMAND   *
//*  PROCESSORS WHICH REQUIRE SHARED  DATASETS, AND THE DISADVAN-   *
//*  TAGE  OF HAVING  USERS CODE  CLISTS TO  PERFORM THESE  ALLO-   *
//*  CATIONS BECOMES CLEAR.                                         *
//*                                                                 *
//*  A SINGLE, COMMON  CLIST WHICH ALL USERS COULD USE  IS A MORE   *
//*  ATTRACTIVE  ALTERNATIVE.   INDEED, FOR  SIMPLE  ALLOCATIONS,   *
//*  SUCH A  CLIST WOULD SUFFICE.  BUT  THERE IS OFTEN A  NEED TO   *
//*  INCLUDE    SOME    USER-SPECIFIC   DATASETS    ALONG    WITH   *
//*  SYSTEM-MAINTAINED  DATASETS.  USING  THE  PDF PANEL  LIBRARY   *
//*  EXAMPLE AGAIN,  SUPPOSE A USER  REQUIRES THAT HIS  OWN PANEL   *
//*  LIBRARY, CALLED  U9999XX.PANELLIB, BE ALLOCATED TO  THE ISP-   *
//*  PLIB FILE  NAME, AND  THAT THE  STANDARD PDF  PANEL LIBRARY,   *
//*  ISR.V1R1M0.ISRPLIB, BE CONCATENATED TO IT.  THIS IS A COMMON   *
//*  PRACTICE FOR  PDF, AND EVEN MORE  COMMON IN THE CASE  OF THE   *
//*  DIALOG MANAGER,  WHERE USERS ARE  ALLOWED TO HAVE  THEIR OWN   *
//*  PANELS FOR USE BY THE DIALOG MANAGER.                          *
//*                                                                 *
//*  THE REQUIRED TSO ALLOCATE COMMAND WOULD BE:                    *
//*                                                                 *
//*    ALLOC FI(ISPPLIB) DS(PANELLIB 'ISR.V1R1M0.ISRPLIB') SHR      *
//*                                                                 *
//*  IT WOULD BE  POSSIBLE, IF NOT EASY, TO CODE  SUCH A FACILITY   *
//*  INTO A COMMON CLIST.  BUT IF  THE CLIST WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR   *
//*  A LARGE NUMBER OF PRE-ALLOCATIONS,  AND EACH ALLOWED FOR ONE   *
//*  OR  MORE  CONCATENATIONS,  EITHER AHEAD  OF  OR  BEHIND  THE   *
//*  SYSTEM-MAINTAINED DATASETS, THE CLIST WOULD BECOME EXTREMELY   *
//*  CUMBERSOME   AND   USING   IT   WOULD   BE   DIFFICULT   AND   *
//*  TIME-CONSUMING.                                                *
//*                                                                 *
//*  HAVING  EACH  COMMAND  PROCESSOR ALLOCATE  THE  DATASETS  IT   *
//*  REQUIRES IS UNACCEPTABLE, SINCE SUCH  ALLOCATIONS HAVE TO BE   *
//*  HARD-CODED INTO  THE COMMAND PROCESSOR,  AND THIS  LEAVES NO   *
//*  FACILITY FOR  INCLUSION OF USER-SPECIFIC  ALLOCATIONS AND/OR   *
//*  CONCATENATIONS.   EVERYBODY GETS  THE  SAME  SET OF  DATASET   *
//*  ALLOCATIONS, REGARDLESS OF REQUIREMENTS.                       *
//*                                                                 *
//*  THUS, OF THE FOUR METHODS  LISTED ABOVE FOR ALLOCATING DATA-   *
//*  SETS, NONE IS FREE OF PROBLEMS.   A BETTER METHOD IS NEEDED,   *
//*  ONE WHICH  IS NOT CONSTRAINED  BY THE  LIMITATIONS MENTIONED   *
//*  ABOVE.                                                         *
//*                                                                 *

//*  GDA WAS DEVELOPED TO MEET THE  NEEDS DESCRIBED IN THE PREVI-   *
//*  OUS SECTION.   SPECIFICALLY, GDA WAS  DEVELOPED IN  ORDER TO   *
//*  PROVIDE A MEANS TO ALLOW  THE PRE-ALLOCATION OF DATASETS FOR   *
//*  THE DIALOG MANAGER AND PDF.  IT  WAS DECIDED THAT GDA SHOULD   *
//*  PERMIT  THE ALLOCATION  OF USER-SPECIFIC  DATASETS AHEAD  OF   *
//*  AND/OR  BEHIND   THE  "STANDARD"  DIALOG  MANAGER   AND  PDF   *
//*  DATASETS, AT THE USER'S OPTION.  SINCE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF   *
//*  OTHER  COMMAND  PROCESSORS AND  APPLICATION  PROGRAMS  WHICH   *
//*  REQUIRE SIMILAR DATASET ALLOCATIONS (AND THERE ARE LIKELY TO   *
//*  BE EVEN MORE IN THE FUTURE),  THE DESIGN OF GDA WAS GENERAL-   *
//*  IZED SO AS TO ALLOW ALLOCATION  OF DATASETS OTHER THAN THOSE   *
//*  REQUIRED FOR DIALOG MANAGER AND/OR PDF EXECUTION.              *
//*                                                                 *

//*     THIS FILE IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A PERSON WHO IS WRITING      *
//*     ISPF/ PDF PANELS, ETC AND DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IT IS ALL       *
//*     ABOUT. BUT IT WORKS !!!!!! SO IS IT THAT BAD? (IT MIGHT     *
//*     INSPIRE SOMEONE TO WRITE MORE). MOST OF THIS FILE ARE       *
//*     ISPF/PDF GOODIES FOR STRAIGHT TSO TYPE FUNCTIONS. NOW       *
//*     THAT WE HAVE ISPF/PDF, OUR USERS (AND SOME SYSTEMS          *
//*     TYPES) ARE LOST IF IT ISN'T SITTING ON A MENU, ETC.  SO     *
//*     AFTER TRYING TO GET THEM TO USE TSO AS TSO, I STARTED TO    *
//*     PUT SOME THINGS INTO MENUS, PANELS, ETC.  THEY LOVE IT.     *
//*     SO WHO CAN ARGUE WITH SUCCESS. AS I SAID, THIS IS MY        *
//*     FIRST ATTEMPT AT CODING THIS STUFF, SO I WILL BE ADDING     *
//*     , SUBTRACTING, REFINING, ETC AS TIME GOES BY.               *

//*     MY GOAL IS TO WRITE ISPF/PDF MENUS, ECT AND MODIFY AS       *
//*     LITTLE IBM LIBRARIES AS POSSIBLE. SO TO UNDERSTAND HOW      *
//*     TO DO THIS YOU MUST COMPREHEND THE FILES YOU CAN            *
//*     ALLOCATE IN LOGON PROCEDURE OF A TSO USER THAT HAVE TO      *

//*     THERE ARE MORE DD CARDS IN THE LOGON PROC BUT THESE ARE     *

//*     WILL MAKE IS TO 'ISR@PRIM' IN IBM'S PANEL LIBRARY (THIS     *
//*     IS THE MASTER PANEL). COPY THIS ONE TO OUR PANEL LIBRARY    *
//*     WHICH IS CONCATENATED  AHEAD OF IBM'S. ALL OTHER            *
//*     LIBRARIES ARE JUST CONCATENTATED WITH IBM'S. SINCE MY       *
//*     GOAL IS NOT TO CHANGEIBM SCREENS ETC, WE WILL HAVE NO       *
//*     PROBLEM. NOW ALL WE DO IS PLACE PANELS IN 'PANEL'           *
//*     LIBRARIES, MSGS IN 'MSG' LIBRARIES, ETC.                    *

//*    THE FILE IS CONSTRUCTED OF MEMBERS AS FOLLOWS: THE PANEL     *
//*    IS PUT IN AS A NAME TRAILED WITH A #PN (N IF MORE THAN       *
//*    1), THE SKELETON IS THE NAME TRAILED WITH A #SN (N IF        *
//*    MORE THAN 1), AND THE CLIST IS THE NAME TRAILED WITH A       *
//*    #CN (N IF MORE THAN 1).                                      *
//*                                                                 *
//*    NOTE1: HAVE YET TO INCORPORATE SOME TUTORIALS, MSGS, ETC.    *
//*           WHEN I DO, THE PHILOSOPHY IS THAT ALL ITEMS WILL      *
//*           FALL TOGETHER.                                        *
//*    NOTE2: SOME OF THE TUTORIAL MATERIAL IS REALLY TUTORIALS     *
//*           IN THE PUREST SENSE, THEY ARE PANELS, SO THEY         *
//*           BELONG IN THE PANEL LIBRARY.                          *
//*    NOTE3: SOME OF MY CLISTS ARE NOT TOO ELEGANT, THIS IS MY     *
//*           1ST CHANCE TO CODE THEM.                              *
