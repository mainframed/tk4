This diskette contains the following files:

README.TXT    You are reading it

LNICHO.REX    Contains all REXX programs. Needs to be uploaded to a PS
file (LRECL=80) and then unloaded to a PDS using IEBUPDTE. Sample JCL to
unload is in REXUPD.JCL. You will need to allocate a DSORG=PS, LRECL=80,
RECFM=FB file on MVS to upload LNICHO.REX to. Then run the REXUPD job,
being sure to put in your own SYSIN and SYSUT2 data set names.  The
beginning of each program includes the following: Purpose of the REXX
program, Input files needed, Output files created, and Presort
requirements.

LNICHO.PAR     Contains routines that can be used to parse record types
D, M, C, V, T, and B as well as the standard header. Needs to be
uploaded to a PS (LRECL=80) file and then unloaded to a PDS using
IEBUPDTE. Sample JCL to unload it is in REXUPD.JCL. Use the same
procedure as documented for LNICHO.REX.

REXUPD.JCL     Sample JCL to create a PDS from the PS file you uploaded.

DCOLLECT.JCL   Sample JCL to run DCOLLECT collection, and create most of
the files used for input into the REXX programs.
