                 A SHORT EXPLANATION OF THIS FILE

This source file (185) and file 186 (load module library) enable
the system programmer to privately authorize TSO commands and not
give this privilege to the rest of the TSO users.

The trick of doing this depends on two things:
    1 - You have access to an APF authorized steplib.
    2 - You have TSO/E release 2 or higher (although the same idea
         applies to all of the old releases of TSO for way back! )

There are tables that TSO uses to determine whether an authorized
command or program should be permitted to run.  These tables used to
be inside of module IKJEFT02, but now, IBM has separated them out into
a separate csect IKJTABLS.  With TSO/E release 2, there is now a
parmlib member IKJTSOnn which overrides IKJTABLS when IKJTABLS is
in LPALIB.  However, if you have a copy of IKJTABLS in an authorized
steplib, IKJTABLS overrides both the parmlib member and the copy of
IKJTABLS in SYS1.LPALIB.

As shipped, IKJTABLS is rather small, and has four csects:
IKJEFTE2, IKJEFTE8, IKJEFTNS, and IKJEFTAP.  See the "TSO Customization"
manual for detailed information on these.

The problem for us is:  The IKJTSOnn member can have many many entries,
and it can be a big table.  IKJTABLS as shipped, only has a few slots
for entries.  But it can be enlarged, unlimitedly, for all practical
purposes.

So this file is to show you how to enlarge IKJTABLS, copy all the
IKJTSOnn entries into it, leave a zillion more slots for any other
programs you may desire to run authorized, and run all this privately
and merrily from your own authorized steplib.

File 185 is a source file which has disassembled source for my own
IKJTABLS csects.  This is along with enough JCL to reassemble it.
(I used STARTOOL from Serena to create this disassembled source.  In
fact, with STARTOOL, this entire business can be done in less than
half an hour, and these two files are really unnecessary, because you
can create the whole thing instantly with the disassembler and the
type-over full-screen load module zapper.)

File 186 is a load library containing my own IKJTABLS load module and
its aliases, which can probably be used as-is in an authorized steplib
on any TSO/E 2.1, 2.2, or 2.3 system.

Again.  Please remember that you're the system doctor.  When you run
anything authorized there is always potential to put the system in
peril.  You're there to fix stuff, not to ruin your company's valuable
investment in electronic data processing.  Anyway, I'd feel better
if you-all read this cautionary statement.  Thanks.
