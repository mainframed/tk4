*                                                                     *
*STATUS: CHANGE LEVEL 000.                                            *

*FUNCTION/OPERATION: THE ERROR PATTERNS GENERATED DURING SCANIII ARE  *
*   HANDLED AND THE CORRESPONDING DIAGNOSTIC MESSAGES ARE GENERATED.  *
*                                                                     *

*        IEX31000 - ERROR MESSAGE EDITING         XCTL EP=IEX31       *
*   THE MODULE IS ENTERED FROM IEX30.                                 *
*                                                                     *
*INPUT: N/A                                                           *
*                                                                     *
*OUTPUT: THE DIAGNOSTIC MESSAGES ARE PUT OUT ON SYSPRINT. IF SYSPRINT *
*   IS DOWN, THIS IS REPORTED ON THE CONSOLE TYPEWRITER.              *
*                                                                     *
*EXTERNAL ROUTINE: THE PRINT ROUTINE IN IEX00 IS USED.                *
*                                                                     *
*EXIT-NORMAL: IF NO TERMINATING ERROR HAS OCCURRED CONTROL IS GIVEN   *
*   TO THE NEXT PHASE BY MEANS OF  XCTL EP=IEX40.                     *
*                                                                     *
*EXIT-ERROR: IF A TERMINATING ERROR HAS OCCURRED (IN THIS MODULE OR   *
*   THE PRECEDING) CONTROL IS GIVEN TO THE TERMINATING MODULE BY MEANS*
*   OF  XCTL EP=51002.                                                *
*                                                                     *
*TABLES/WORKAREAS: THE MESSAGE TEXTS WITH CORRESPONDING ADDRESS TABLE *
*   ARE IN THE LOAD MODULE IEX31M.                                    *
*   THE ERROR MESSAGE EDITING ROUTINE, CSECT IEX60000, ALSO USES THE  *
*   FOLLOWING TABLES:                                                 *
*   WINTEBC   FOR TRANSLATION OF INTERNAL CHARACTERS TO EBCDIC        *
*   WSYMBSRC  FOR TRANSLATION OF                                      *
*   WSYMBSTK                     INTERNAL SYMBOLS TO EBCDIC           *
*   WORDSEBC  FOR TRANSLATION OF COMPOUND SYMBOLS IF SOURCE IN EBCDIC *
*   WORDSISO  FOR TRANSLATION OF COMPOUND SYMBOLS IF SOURCE IN ISOCODE*
*   WEBCDIC   FOR TRANSLATION EBCDIC-EBCDIC                           *
*                                                                     *
*   A WORKAREA OF 270 BYTES, WAREA, IS USED FOR BUILDING THE MESSAGES.*
*                                                                     *
*ATTRIBUTES: NONE.                                                    *
*                                                                     *
*NOTES: CHARACTER CODE DEPENDENCE: FOR THE BUILDING OF A MESSAGE      *
*   (CODE PART BETWEEN COT03 AND COT12) THE FOLLOWING APPLIES:        *
*   IN CASE NO SOURCE INFORMATION IS TO BE INSERTED (COT31), OR IF    *
*   THE INFORMATION IS EBCDIC-CHARACTERS (COT07), THE OPERATION OF    *
*   CSECT IEX60000 DEPENDS UPON AN INTERNAL REPRESENTATION OF THE     *
*   EXTERNAL CHARACTER SET WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO THE ONE USED AT     *
*   ASSEMBLY TIME.                                                    *
*   IF THE SOURCE INFORMATION TO BE INSERTED IS INTERNAL CHARACTERS   *
*   (COT33) THE OPERATION OF CSECT IEX60000 DEPENDS UPON A TRANSLATION*
*   FROM THE INTERNAL REPRESENTATION TO THE EBCDIC CHARACTER SET BY   *
*   MEANS OF THE TABLE 'WINTEBC'.                                     *
*   IF THE SOURCE INFORMATION TO BE INSERTED IS INTERNAL ALGOL SYMBOLS*
*   (COT10) THE OPERATION OF CSECT IEX60000 DEPENDS UPON A TRANSLATION*
*   FROM THE INTERNAL REPRESENTATION TO THE EBCDIC CHARACTER SET BY   *
*   MEANS OF THE TABLES 'WSYMBSTK'/'WSYMBSRC' AND 'WORDSISO'/         *
*   'WORDSEBC'.                                                       *
*   FOR THE OUTPUT OF A MESSAGE (CODE PART BETWEEN COT12 AND COT21)   *
*   THE FOLLOWING APPLIES:                                            *
*   WHEN A MESSAGE HAS BEEN BUILT IN EBCDIC, AN EBCDIC-EBCDIC TRANSLA-*
*   TION IS PERFORMED BEFORE OUTPUT BY MEANS OF THE TABLE 'WEBCDIC'.  *
*   THUS THE OUTPUT MAY BE MODIFIED BY MAKING CHANGES IN THIS TABLE.  *
*                                                                     *
*   THE OPERATION OF CSECT IEX31000 DOES NOT DEPEND UPON A PARTICULAR *
*   INTERNAL REPRESENTATION OF THE EXTERNAL CHARACTER SET.            *
*                                                                     *
*   AT SYSTEM GENERATION THIS MODULE WILL BE LINKED TOGETHER WITH     *
*   THE MODULE IEX31M TO FORM THE MODULE IEX31 IN LINKLIB.            *
*                                                                     *
*   THIS MODULE IS ONLY INTENDED TO BE EXECUTED IN CONNECTION         *
*   WITH THE OTHER MODULES OF THE ALGOL COMPILER. IN PARTICULAR IT    *
*   REQUIRES THE COMMON WORKAREA.                                     *
*                                                                     *
