Subject: poffload program

  This file consists of an assembler program (with included
  macros) and a REXX exec, to print out tapes created on
  a DOS/VSE system using POWER OFFLOAD.  The printing can
  (I think) be done on either DOS/VSE, MVS, or VM/CMS.

  This file was contributed by Knut Feiert, and the REXX exec
  was translated by him, from German into English.  The original
  German had ASCII --> EBCDIC translation difficulties, because
  of the 'umlauted' German letters, and the 'ss' letter.

       (note by Sam Golob 98/03/05  -  rest of file by Knut)


The enclosed file Poffload.zip contains the assembler source
along with the home grown macros and a rexx procedure for VM.
(Now translated into English by Knut.)  The usage of that
procedure requires that the list output is not closed at end
of program because the procedure does its own list handling.

If you have problems with the procedure pls let me know.
