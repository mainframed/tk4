  THIS UTILITY WAS WRITTEN AS A REPLACEMENT FOR ISPF/PDF'S 3.8 "OUTLIST"
UTILITY. IT MAKES USE OF ISPF'S TABLE SERVICES TO PROVIDE A SIMPLE, YET
EFFECTIVE USER INTERFACE TO THE JOB QUEUE. A SINGLE CLIST DRIVES THIS
VERSION OF THE OUTLIST UTILITY. THE CLIST COMMENTS COMBINED WITH THE
ISPF TUTORIAL PANELS PROVIDE A SELF-DOCUMENTING SYSTEM.  SEE MEMBER
$$INDEX FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE OUTLIST UTILITY COMPONENTS.
MODIFICATIONS TO SUIT YOUR SHOP'S STANDARDS GOES WITHOUT SAYING. IT IS
STRONGLY ADVISABLE THAT ALL COMPONENTS BE THOROUGHLY REVIEWED IN THEIR
ENTIRETY BEFORE IMPLEMENTING AT YOUR SHOP.

 THIS UTILITY IS GREAT FOR 4381-TYPE SHOPS WHO CAN'T AFFORD THE LIKES OF
'WE WON'T MENTION NAMES' TO PERFORM THE BASIC FUNCTIONS IT PROVIDES.
THE PDS CONTAINING THIS UTILITY OCCUPIES ONE MERE 3380 TRACK. IT IS
IN UNLOADED IEBCOPY FORMAT.

 AS WITH ANY APPLICATION, IMPROVEMENTS CAN BE MADE.  I WOULD GREATLY
APPRECIATE YOUR SUGGESTIONS, CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM, OR QUESTIONS RE-
GARDING THE USE OF THIS UTILITY.

 THANKS, AND MAY THIS UTILITY BE OF USE TO YOU!     MARK
