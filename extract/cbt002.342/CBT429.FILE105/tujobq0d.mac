%TUTORIAL ----  A B L  JOB Queue Processor: DELETE JOB Option  ------- T
+
+ Command ===>_ZCMD
+
+  Selecting Option "D" results in the complete deletion of the JOB from
+ the system if the JOB is on the OUTPUT queue.  Multiple JOBS may be
+ "mass deleted" by typing a "D" in the Option field for each JOB to be
+ deleted then pressing ENTER.  DELETE requests may be interspersed with
+ other Options. The list of JOBS is simply processed in a top-down
+ fashion, regardless of the possible various Options selected.
+
+
+ JOBS on the held output queue ("Class Q" or MSGCLASS=Q JOBS) will be
+ deleted from the system automatically after 7 days.
+
+ %NOTE:+ Selecting option%D+for a JOB that is EXECUTING results in the
+         termination of the JOB but leaves the JOB on the OUTPUT queue
+         for subsequent viewing provided the JOB was run in MSGCLASS Q.
