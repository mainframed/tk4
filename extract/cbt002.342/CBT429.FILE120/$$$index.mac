The numbering scheme of the members of this file is very simple.

  All articles start with the letters:   CL  (which stands for "column")

  The year of publication is:  89, 90, and the like.
  The sequence of publication is numeric, for sorting purposes,
   and then alphabetic, for easier identification.

  Thus, CL8901JA is from the January 1989 issue of "Technical Support".

  Hope this helps.
