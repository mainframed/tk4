      This small note is being presented as restitution for our
readers.  Our sample ISPF command table was missing from my March
article.  Much of the usefulness of that article was tied to the
sample table, whose purpose was to make your ISPF session into a
better workbench.

      By the use of RECURSIVE INVOCATIONS OF ISPF FUNCTIONS ON THE
SAME SCREEN (a feature which is practical with ISPF Version 2), you
need not disturb an ongoing edit in order to allocate a file you
need.  If a command (for example, DATaset) has been included in the
active command table for your session, all that has to be done is to
invoke the "DAT" command from your command line, and press ENTER.
This calls the ISPF 3.2 (dataset allocation, rename, and delete)
panel ON TOP OF YOUR EDIT PANEL.  When the allocation is done,
ending that panel gets you back into the edit, where you were.  The
same is true for other ISPF functions that are INVOKED BY COMMANDS
IN THE ISPF COMMAND TABLE.

      Recursive invocations of ANY ISPF FUNCTIONS can be set up by
entries in the ISPF command tables.  Our March article showed how
these entries are created.  If you follow our sample table and expand
on it, you will add much power to your ISPF session.

      It is possible to RUN MANY ISPF FUNCTIONS AT THE SAME TIME by
taking advantage of the recursive ISPF invocations.  COMMANDS CAN
DUPLICATE ANY FUNCTION WHICH IS SELECTABLE FROM A PANEL.  Our
technique is TO MAKE COMMANDS to invoke frequently used PANELS
directly, on top of the current screen.  This has the advantage that
upon END from the invoked panel, you're still in the screen that was
being used before.

      How do we do this?  A command table is a PDS member allocated
to the ddname ISPTLIB or the ddname ISPTABL.  ISPTLIB is used for
output, and ISPTABL is used for input, so if you plan to update a
table, it must be in a library allocated to ISPTABL.  Command table
names adhere to the convention "applid"+CMDS.  In other words, the
name of the command table member is the name of the applid suffixed
by the string "CMDS".  ISPF option 3.9 is used for editing command
tables.  It assumes that your desired table is in a PDS allocated to
ddname ISPTABL, and that it IS NOT CURRENTLY BEING USED by any
session.  Therefore, you must update a COPY of the real table, and
not one that is in use.

      The ISPF 3.9 entry panel asks for the name of the command table
member, minus the "CMDS" suffix.  The normal default ISPF command
table members are called ISPCMDS and ISRCMDS, which we cannot edit
directly, so let's assume we have made copies of them in an ISPTABL
library, called XSPCMDS and XSRCMDS.  To edit XSPCMDS, we enter XSP
on the ISPF 3.9 entry panel screen, and we proceed to add or change
entries to the table.  After the table is saved by using the END key,
we can replace the ISPCMDS member by the XSPCMDS member, get out of
ISPF entirely, and then back into ISPF.  The new entries should now
be effective on our ISPF session.

      A lot of people know about ISPF command tables, so why are we
writing about them here?  The suggestion is as follows:  Take ALL
THE ISPF 3.x UTILITY FUNCTIONS and make COMMANDS to execute them
ON TOP OF WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW.  Then you can do a dataset allocation
or a dataset list or a SUPERC, or even a command table edit, and not
lose your current screen which contains the work you're doing.

      Here are more hints on how to make the table entries.

      Use the SELECT statements in the PROC section of your ISRUTIL
(ISPF 3) panel, to determine the correct statements to put into the
command table for the 3.x functions.  Panels are allocated to the
ddname ISPPLIB in your session.  This info should be of help in
locating your current panel whose name is ISRUTIL.  Just write the word
SELECT, and copy the select statements exactly, without the quotes,
just as they appear in the ISRUTIL panel.  You can alternatively copy
the entries from my sample table additions (which are for ISPF v2.3).
Please be aware that the utility invocations for ISPF v2.2 may be
slightly different from mine.

      Here's another hint in the process of exploring for commands:
The name of the panel currently being used can be displayed by
entering the command PANELID on the command line.  The actual name of
the panel will be displayed in the upper left corner of the screen.
PANELID OFF turns the panel name display off.

      COMMANDS CAN BE MADE TO SELECT ANY SCREEN.  I've included our
sample of some command table additions I've made.  Anyone can get
very creative with this, and really ease the burdens in his everyday
work.  Further assistance can be obtained from the IBM ISPF manuals.

      One should create a TSO HELP member called "CMDTABLE", which
keeps the names of the extra commands handy in case you forget them.
To get really fancy, the help can be in the form of a new panel that
is selected by a new command in the command table.

      Good luck with your own command table additions, and we hope you
can make use of our sample table.  The included sample has extra hints
and tips embedded right within it.  Please examine it carefully.
