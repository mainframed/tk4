)F       FUNCTION -

            READY IS THE TSO COMMAND THAT WILL ATTACH IKJEFT01
            WHICH IS THE TERMINAL MONITOR PROGRAM (TMP)

)X       SYNTAX -

            READY, %READY, XEQ READY, DO READY

)O       OPERANDS - NONE

)S       EXPLANATION -

            AT LOGON TIME THE PROGRAM THAT IS EXECUTED IS IKJEFT01
            WHICH IS KNOWN AS THE TMP (THE TERMINAL MONITOR PROGRAM).
            WHEN READY IS TYPED IN YOU EXECUTE A PROGRAM CALLED
            CBT954 WHICH DOES AN ATTACH OF THE TMP (IKJEFT01). WHAT
            YOU WILL SEE AT YOUR TERMINAL WHEN YOU DO THIS IS THE
            MESSAGE: 'FOR INFORMATION ON READY TYPE IN HELP READY'
            THEN THE WORD  READY.
            YOU MAY ISSUE THE READY COMMAND AT ANY TIME YOU CAN ENTER
            A TSO COMMAND (EX. UNDER EDIT MODE, OPTION 6 OF SPF,
            READY MODE, ETC.). AFTER THE READY HAS BEEN ISSUED YOU
            MAY ISSUE ANY OTHER TSO COMMAND.
            TO GET OUT OF THIS ENVIRONMENT TYPE IN LOGOFF AND YOU
            WILL BE RETURNED TO WHERE YOU PREVIOUSLY ISSUED THE
            READY COMMAND.  IF YOU WHERE UNDER SPF OPTION 6 AND
            ISSUED READY, WHEN YOU TYPE IN LOGOFF YOU WOULD BE
            RETURNED TO SPF OPTION 6 AGAIN.
            SINCE THIS PSEUDO-READY MODE IS REALLY NOT NORMAL
            (NOR SUPPORTED BY IBM) YOU CAN DO THINGS THAT ARE
            NOT USUALLY ALLOWED. EXAMPLE - EDIT A DATA SET,
            TYPE IN READY, DELETE THE DATA SET YOU WERE EDITING
            BEFORE YOU TYPED IN READY, DON'T DO THIS KIND OF
            NONSENSE EVEN THOUGH IT WILL WORK.
            ONE PROBLEM WITH THE PSEUDO-READY MODE IS THAT
            THERE IS NO COMMAND TO TELL YOU WHAT LEVEL YOU
            ARE AT, THE ONLY WAY TO FIND OUT IS TO TYPE IN
            LOGOFF UNTIL YOU GET LOGGED OFF OF YOUR TSO SESSION,
            AND THEN YOU'LL KNOW YOU WENT 1 TOO MANY LOGOFFS.
