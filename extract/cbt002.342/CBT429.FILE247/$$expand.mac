                    EXPANDING SYS1.BRODCAST


You can now expand SYS1.BRODCAST, by dumping it to a flat file with
the BCMDUMP program from this package, and restoring it to a RECFM=DA
copy, with the BCMEXPND program.  User Message records are added to
the end of the copy, and the header record is adjusted to reflect the
new number of records in the file.

You can move SYS1.BRODCAST to a device of different geometry.  The
BCMEXPND and BCMREST programs adjust for this.  For example, you can
expand or restore a BCMDUMP of SYS1.BRODCAST, which was previously
on a 3380 disk pack, to a 3390 disk pack, and so forth.

No messages are lost from the expanded copy.  It's not like an
ACCOUNT SYNC, where you lose all the user messages.

See the JCL members that come with BCMDUMP (BCMDUMP$) and BCMEXPND
(BCMEXPN$) for examples of how to run these programs.

If you are actually expanding SYS1.BRODCAST, you should do it just
before an IPL, because no enqueue protection is provided, or is
necessary.

Of necessity, you have to expand SYS1.BRODCAST into a copy, because
it has to go into one extent, and you're now putting it into a bigger
extent.  The copy should be renamed and recataloged as SYS1.BRODCAST
just before the IPL.

To just RESTORE a dump of SYS1.BRODCAST to one of the same size,
perhaps across different device types, use program BCMREST instead
of program BCMEXPND.
