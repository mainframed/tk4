*        RECORD TYPE.  RECORD 1 AND THE 'NOTICES' DIRECTORY AND
*        'NOTICES' MESSAGE RECORDS ARE LOCATED IN THE FIXED PART
*        OF THE BRODCAST DATA SET AT THE BEGINNING. THE 'MAIL'
*        DIRECTORY AND MESSAGE RECORDS WILL APPEAR RANDOMLY
*        THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF 'SYS1.BRODCAST'.  USER ID
*        DIRECTORY RECORDS X'01' ARE CHAINED TO EACH OTHER, AS
*        ARE USER MESSAGE RECORDS TYPE X'03'.  THE LAST 3 BYTES
*        OF THESE RECORDS CONTAIN THE RELATIVE RECORD ADDRESS OF
*        THE NEXT RECORD IN THE CHAIN.  ISPF BROWSE WILL NOT
*        DISPLAY THE LAST BYTE OF A SYS1.BRODCAST RECORD BECAUSE
*        OF THE ONE BYTE KEY AT THE BEGINNING.  YOU HAVE TO USE
*        THE "REVIEW" TSO COMMAND TO LOOK AT THE SYS1.BRODCAST
*        DATASET.  (CBT TAPE FILE 134 - LOAD MODULE ON FILE 135)
*        "REVIEW" CAN PROPERLY DISPLAY KEYED RECORDS.
*
*
*        THE 7 RECORD TYPES AND THEIR KEYS ARE:
*
*        X'00'     BRODCAST 'NOTICES' DIRECTORY RECORD.
*
*        X'01'     USER 'MAIL' DIRECTORY RECORD.
*
*        X'02'     BROADCAST 'NOTICES' MESSAGE RECORD.
*
*        X'03'     USER 'MAIL' MESSAGE RECORD.
*
*        X'04'     FIRST RECORD OF 'SYS1.BRODCAST' DATA SET.
*
*        X'05'     RBA ADDRESS OF FIRST DUMMY RECORD AVAILABLE.  JDM1
*
*        X'FF'     DUMMY INACTIVE 'MAIL' MESSAGE RECORD.
*
*        THE 'BDAM' ACCESS METHOD READS THESE RECORDS WITHOUT
*        KEYS, SO THE KEY IDENTIFIER IS NOT READ IN WITH THE
*        REMAINING 129 CHARACTERS OF EACH RECORD.
