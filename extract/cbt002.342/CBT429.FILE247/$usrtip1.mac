We have downloaded the original version of the BCMSCAN program and it
works very well, thank you VERY much.  We have the usual nuisances of
applications that issue brodcasts to dead (vacationing,
inactive)users.

We found, quite by accident, that if you have a user with lots of
backlogged messages, and they are not available, and the messages are
expendable, then we can remove their TSO segment, then add it right
back and the messages are gone from SYS1.BRODCAST.  Beats having to
reset their PWD and logging on.

Also, if the user profile is truly obsolete, do the "ALU -user-
NOTSO" and leave it that way till you track down the offending
broadcaster.  A message will appear in SYSLOG (IKJ144I), and by using
the timestamp, we can track down the offending app.

Keep up the good work, look forward the the enhancements.

Hi Everybody,

    For those of you who need this, I just want to announce that it's
available.

    As you probably know, I've written a package of utilities to manage
the SYS1.BRODCAST dataset.  This package is called the "Broadcast
Manager" package.  IBM never gave an administrator the tools to list any
user's messages, or to delete them if they filled up SYS1.BRODCAST.  All
you can do (with IBM's tools) is to delete everyone's messages.  Blow up
the barn to kill a fly.  Even if you go to TSO Userlogs (and you
should--they're useful), you can still make very good use of a set of
tools that manages SYS1.BRODCAST.  SYS1.BRODCAST is not going away.

    My package (which is free) allows anyone to list anyone else's
messages (you can customize the security on this), and it affords the
TSO administrator at least 4 different ways to delete a selected user's
messages, to make room in the SYS1.BRODCAST dataset.  Besides other
tools that are included in the package, I've now added facilities to
take a fixed-blocked LRECL=130 backup of SYS1.BRODCAST, and to restore
the backup to a usable copy of SYS1.BRODCAST, even on a different device
type.  A similar program called BCMEXPND will enlarge SYS1.BRODCAST from
the backup to any bigger size, so you don't lose any information or old
messages.  My message listing tools and one of my message deleting
tools, also work from the copy, as well as from the original
SYS1.BRODCAST.  Even if you do an ACCOUNT SYNC, you can now take a
usable backup of SYS1.BRODCAST from before, so you can save the messages
from the restored DSORG=DA copy.

    I've now added a program called BCMSEND, which can send messages to
a copy of SYS1.BRODCAST as well as to the original (if you have update
access to it, or if you authorize the command and/or rig it up with RACF
properly).  The interesting thing about BCMSEND is that it only writes
to BRODCAST, and it doesn't send a terminal message to a logged on
user.  The second interesting thing about BCMSEND is that it doesn't use
the TSO parser, so it doesn't "syntax-check" the messages at all.
Everything beyond the blanks past the userid, which is in the command
buffer, is sent--spaces, any number of quotes, hex characters, and so
forth.  LISTBC will blast these out to the user, when it is run
afterwards, or at logon time.  You may think of some interesting uses
for this facility.

    You can download this package at:

ftp://ftp.cbttape.org/pub/cbttape/adhoc/CBT247.zip (case sensitive)

    Fairly full documentation is included in the package.  Good luck.  I
hope it's useful to some of you out there.

    The next time I see a message on IBM-MAIN that someone has a
"SYS1.BRODCAST FULL" problem, I hope that the sender doesn't get five
replies back, that he should do an ACCOUNT/SYNC, or go to TSO Userlogs,
as happened recently.  (Kind of peeves me, when I've got these big guns
available for everyone to use.  Thanks in advance for your support.)

Regards,    Sam Golob
