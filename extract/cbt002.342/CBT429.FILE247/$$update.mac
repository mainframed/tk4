June 9, 99  -  Corrected all relevant programs, so that if you
               enter the command without any userid, you'll get a
               useful message instead of a blank response.

               Commented out code that requires that the TSO user
               have OPER and ACCT authority.  You can put the code
               back, if you need to.

               Corrected an assembly error in all programs involving
               execution of the IKJIFRIF macro.  These are BCMUSADD,
               BCMUSDEL, BCMDEL1.  Problem was that the CVT macro
               had to expressly say DSECT=YES, otherwise ENTRY state-
               ments were generated for the CVT extensions, and they
               are not allowed to occur within a DSECT.

               Increased the capacity of BCMSCAN to count more than
               999 outstanding messages.  Now can do 99999 for each
               user.  Problem was that the counter was PL2'0'.  Made
               it PL3'0'.

June 2, 99  -  Added program BCMSEND, and debugged it for "BRODCAST
               dataset full" condition.

May 27, 99  -  BCMDUMP, BCMREST, BCMEXPND to create copies of the
               SYS1.BRODCAST dataset, and be able to expand the
               dataset (even across different device types) without
               losing any messages.
