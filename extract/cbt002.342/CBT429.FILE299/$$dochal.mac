Hi!

After testing it on our RS6000 tapes, I found that it was showing
the " **One or more files have density indicated incorrectly in
labels. All files are written at 1600 BPI" message when NOT
applicable or true!

Because, in code that Ron Tansky added in 1993, he set default
values in HDR2 to the "?" char as HDR2 is not found on these
tapes, which is fine.  BUT, then at EOF, the hardware true density
is compared to saved HDR2 value. This compare will ALWAYS fail due
to "?" and thus create the bad density message.  The code I have
added (and my modif tag line) addresses this problem.

I have tested this and it appeared to work correctly.  Not maybe
the best code, but it fixes the misleading message.
