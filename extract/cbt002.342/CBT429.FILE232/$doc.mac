$DOC - DOCUMENTATION MEMBER FOR IOGENMAC MACROS

------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADMINISTRIVIA (I HAVE TO PUT THIS IN HERE OR THEY FIRE ME):

THESE MACROS WERE DEVELOPED BY:
  JOE VEILLEUX
  MIS CENTRAL SOFTWARE SERVICES - ADMIN III
  AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS, INC. (SHARE INSTALLATION CODE APC).
  P.O. BOX 538
  ALLENTOWN, PA 18105
  (215) 481-4558

THE MACROS MAY BE TRADED, LOANED, OR GIVEN TO ANYONE WHO WANTS THEM, BUT
THEY **MAY NOT** BE SOLD (UNLESS SOMEONE FROM IBM WANTS TO BUY THEM AND
SUPPORT THEM, WHICH IS THE WAY IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE IN THE FIRST
PLACE).  NEITHER JOE VEILLEUX NOR AIR PRODUCTS AND CHEMICALS ASSUMES ANY
REPONSIBILITY FOR THE CONTINUED HEALTH OR SANITY OF ANYONE WHO CHOOSES
TO USE THESE MACROS ("ABANDON HOPE ALL YE WHO ENTER...").

PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CALL ME OR WRITE TO ME WITH SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE
ENHANCEMENTS TO THE MACROS, OR FOR ANY KIND OF VERBAL ABUSE YOU'RE INTO
(OR CATCH ME AT SHARE). I EXPRESSLY DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT I WILL MAKE
ANY KIND OF EFFORT AT IMPLEMENTING ANY OF YOUR SUGGESTIONS, BUT IT'S
WORTH A SHOT.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

PURPOSE (WHAT ARE THESE THINGS GOOD FOR, ANYWAY?):

MY SHOP IS A BIG MVS SHOP THAT IS JUST GETTING INTO VM FOR THE FIRST
TIME. WE'RE GOING TO USE VM/XA SF TO "SPLIT" OUR 3081 INTO A PRODUCTION
MVS/XA V=R ENVIRONMENT TO HANDLE SOME "SPILLOVER" WORKLOAD FROM OUR
MVS/XA 3090-200 AND TO PRESERVE OUR SYSTEM PROGRAMMER TEST ENVIRONMENT
(WE CURRENTLY USE THE WHOLE 3081 FOR TEST) VIA V=V TEST VIRTUAL
MACHINES.  ON THE WHOLE, I THINK WE'RE PRETTY TYPICAL OF VM/XA SF USERS.

ONE MEGA-BIG (THAT'S 1040**2 BIG'S) PROBLEM FACING ME WHEN I WAS
PLANNING FOR VM/XA SF INSTALLATION WAS HOW TO GET THE IO DEFINITIONS
CODED UP. I COULD CODE THEM BY HAND, BUT THAT SEEMED INELEGANT.  SINCE
WE ALREADY HAD THE MVS INFORMATION LAYING AROUND IN VARIOUS FORMS FROM
MVS SYSGEN, I DECIDED TO WRITE SOME ASSEMBLER MACROS WITH THE SAME NAMES
AS THE MVS MACROS USED IN THE IOGEN DECK AND TO USE THE SYSTEM ASSEMBLER
TO ASSEMBLE THE IOGEN DECK WITH MY MACRO LIBRARY (YOU'RE READING A
MEMBER OF IT) ALLOCATED AHEAD OF SYS1.MACLIB IN THE ASM.SYSLIB DD, AND
USE ASSEMBLER "PUNCH" STATEMENTS TO PUNCH "RDEVICE" MACROS TO SYSPUNCH.
CAPTURE THE SYSPUNCH OUTPUT IN A FILE, PORT IT OVER TO VM, COPY IT INTO
THE MIDDLE OF YOUR HCPRIO FILE, FIX THE THINGS THAT IT GENERATED WRONG
(MORE ON THIS LATER) AND DO YOUR "GENERATE HCPRIO ONLY"... VOILA!!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

INSTRUCTIONS:

TO USE THE MACROS, RUN THE JOB CONTAINED IN MEMBER $JCL OF THIS
DATASET. THE IMPORTANT DDNAMES ARE:

   ASM.SYSLIB - CONCATENATE THIS LIBRARY IN FRONT OF SYS1.MACLIB
   ASM.SYSIN  - YOUR MVS STAGE1 IOGEN DECK
   ASM.SYSPUNCH - THE OUTPUT HCPRIO DECK

LIMITATIONS: (MANY)

1. FIRST, THESE MACROS ONLY PUNCH OUT "RDEVICE" MACROS. YOU HAVE TO ADD
   THE "RIOGEN" MACRO TO DEFINE YOUR CONSOLES (AT THE END).

2. ANY OF THE SPECIAL DASD CONTROL UNITS WHERE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO CODE A
   "CUTYPE=" PARAMETER (E.G. 3880-23) WILL NOT HAVE THE "CUTYPE="
   CODED... YOU'VE GOT TO CODE IT YOURSELF.  ALSO, SINCE THESE DEVICES
   ARE NOT SHAREABLE, IF THE MACROS GENERATED "SHARED=YES" YOU SHOULD
   REMOVE IT. OH, YEAH... BY THE WAY...  THERE'S A BUG IN THE VM/XA SF
   RDEVICE MACRO IN THE PROCESSING FOR 3880-23: IT WON'T LET YOU CODE A
   MULTIPLIER FOR THE DEVICE ANY GREATER THAN 8...  (E.G. "RDEVICE
   DEVNO=(380,16)" IS FLAGGED AS INVALID).  I THINK THIS HAS BEEN
   CORRECTED BUT THE LAST TIME I TRIED TO USE (380,16) I GOT ASSEMBLY
   ERROR MNOTE'S. TO GET AROUND IT YOU HAVE TO BREAK IT INTO TWO:
      RDEVICE DEVNO=(380,8).... OTHER PARMS
      RDEVICE DEVNO=(388,8).... OTHER PARMS
   MY MACROS DON'T KNOW ABOUT BUGS IN VM SO YOU'LL HAVE TO CHANGE THESE
   BY HAND.

3. THE MACROS HAVE NO CONCEPT OF 3725/3705/3704 "MODEL=" AND "ADAPTER="
   VALUES. THEY JUST HARDCODE SOME VALUES THAT WERE REASONABLE (AT MY
   SHOP) AS DEFAULTS. I DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND THESE EITHER... ASK YOUR
   VTAM PERSON.

THESE MACROS GENERATE A REASONABLE STARTING POINT FOR BUILDING YOUR
HCPRIO... (BETTER THAN FROM SCRATCH!)  BUT THAT'S ABOUT ALL.  USE THE
OUTPUT FROM THESE MACROS AS YOUR BASE, BUT THEN GO THROUGH EACH ADDRESS
AND LOOK UP THE RDEVICE MACRO IN THE "INSTALLATION, ADMINISTRATION, AND
SERVICE" MANUAL.  COMPARE THE WAY YOU WOULD HAVE CODED THE MACRO TO WHAT
MY MACROS GENERATED, AND MODIFY AS NECESSARY.  I THINK YOU'LL BE PLEASED
THAT YOU WON'T HAVE TO MODIFY A WHOLE LOT, BUT DON'T TAKE ANY OF IT ON
FAITH (BUT BEING SMART MVS SYSTEMS PROGRAMMERS I DIDN'T HAVE TO TELL YOU
THAT, DID I?)
