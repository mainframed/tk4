Future modifications and bug fixes may be provided in subsequent
releases of this file. I hope to add some vector graphic support
to the WIN3270 program in the future if time permits.

Please send me any modifications that you make, or suggestions
if you find this material usefull. I am always willing to hear
from the die hard 3270 users of the world.

Install
-------

There is no special requirements to install these programs.
All of the load modules can be executed by the TSO call
command. The clists will require the dataset names to be
changed to names that you have used.

Compilation of the source requires the SAS/C compiler. The
version 5.50 of the compiler is required to support the
WIN3270 program with the REXX language. The CCOMP clist
was used to compile these programs. Notice that it
specifies a DDname for the included font H files, which
you would need to add to any batch compilation that you
may prefer to use.

Assembly of the BAL code can be done with JCL that is like
the following:

//ASM     EXEC PGM=IEV90,REGION=1024K,
//             PARM='TERM,NODECK,OBJECT,NORENT,XREF(SHORT)'
//SYSLIB   DD  DSN=SYS1.MACLIB,DISP=SHR
//         DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=SDC.C550C.MACLIBA        <=== VERIFY
//SYSUT1   DD  SPACE=(CYL,(5,1)),UNIT=SYSDA
//SYSTERM  DD  SYSOUT=*
//SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
//SYSPUNCH DD  DUMMY
//SYSLIN   DD  DSN=&&OBJSET,UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(80,(200,50)),
//             DISP=(MOD,PASS)
//SYSIN    DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=SASDDF.A.SOURCE(TGETN)       <=== VERIFY
//LKED     EXEC PGM=HEWLF064,PARM='XREF,LET,LIST,NCAL',
//             COND=(6,LT,ASM),REGION=1024K
//SYSLIN   DD   DSN=&&OBJSET,DISP=(OLD,DELETE)
//         DD   DDNAME=SYSIN
//SYSLIB   DD   DSN=SYS1.LINKLIB,DISP=SHR
//SYSLMOD  DD   DISP=SHR,DSN=SASDDF.A.LOADLIB       <=== VERIFY
//SYSUT1   DD   DSN=&&SYSUT1,UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(1024,(50,20))
//SYSPRINT DD   SYSOUT=*
//SYSIN    DD   *
     MODE AMODE(ANY),RMODE(24)
     NAME TGETN(R)
/*

If you change the fonts you will have to firstly use
the font clist then recompile the C programs to include the
H file with the new symbol set definition.
