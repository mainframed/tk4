*  THE INCORZAP PROGRAM AS DISTRIBUTED ON THE CBT MODS TAPE
*  WILL ACCEPT CONTROL STATEMENTS IN THE PARM FIELD ONLY IF
*  IT IS INVOKED WITH THE NAME 'LINKZAP'. OTHERWISE IT READS
*  CONTROL STATEMENTS FROM SYSIN AND IGNORES THE PARM.
*
*  THIS ZAP CHANGES THAT LOGIC, SO THE PROGRAM CAN BE INVOKED
*  UNDER ANY NAME.  THE LENGTH OF THE PARM FIELD BECOMES THE
*  DETERMINING FACTOR - IF IT IS ZERO (NO PARM SPECIFIED)
*  THEN SYSIN WILL BE USED.  OTHERWISE THE PARM FIELD CONTAINS
*  THE CONTROL STATEMENTS.
