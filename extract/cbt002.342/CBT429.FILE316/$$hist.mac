THIS IS A MEMBER OF THE MEMBERS WHICH HAVE BEEN RETIRED TO THE "BIG
PDS IN THE SKY".  SOME ARE JUST NO LONGER VALID AND SOME HAVE BEEN
REMOVED IN FAVOR OF OTHER PEOPLES VERSIONS.  I THINK IT IS GREAT WHEN
SOMEONE TAKES SOME OF THIS CODE AND ENHANCES IT.  I, GENERALLY, WILL
NOT REPLACE THE CODE WHEN THE UPDATED VERSION BECOMES TOO SPECIFIC TO
ONE INSTALLATION OR GOES OFF IN DIRECTIONS WHICH I DO NOT FEEL IS
GENERIC TO ALL.

           PDSLOAD  - REMOVED IN FAVOR OF ONE IN CBT FILE 93.
           OFFLOAD  - REMOVED IN FAVOR OF ONE IN CBT FILE 93.
           TAPESCAN - REMOVED IN FAVOR OF ONE IN CBT FILE 102.
