         Using The IPCS/ESA ISPF Dialogs                     Page #1


         You have IPCS up and a SVCDUMP loaded.  Now what?
         How can I get going with IPCS in the quickest amount of time!
         Don't worry, read this article and be happy.
         I will cover IPCS/ISPF ISPF Dialogs and begin
         discussion of some of my most-often used IPCS/ESA commands.


         This article was based on a session entitled PRACTICAL
         IPCS/ESA DUMP ANALYSIS I gave at Nastec 5.0. in
         Orlando at the end of March 1993.


         Once you have initialized IPCS, you will see the IPCS
         primary option menu.


         ----------- IPCS PRIMARY OPTION MENU  -----------------
         OPTION  ===>

            0  DEFAULTS    - Specify default dump and options
            1  BROWSE      - Browse dump data set
            2  ANALYSIS    - Analyze dump contents
            3  SUBMIT      - Submit problem analysis job to batch
            4  COMMAND     - Enter IPCS subcommand or CLIST
            5  UTILITY     - Perform utility functions
            6  DUMPS       - Manage dump inventory
            T  TUTORIAL    - Learn how to use the IPCS dialog
            X  EXIT        - Terminate using log and list defaults

         Enter END command to terminate IPCS dialog


         After selection option 1 for BROWSE we enter this option:


         ------------------ IPCS - ENTRY PANEL  -----------------------
         COMMAND ==>

          CURRENT DEFAULTS:
           Source ==> DSNAME('USERID.SVCDUMP.S0B0')
           Address space ==>

          OVERRIDE DEFAULTS:
           Source ==> DSNAME('USERID.SVCDUMP.S0B0')
           Address space ==>
           Password      ==>

          POINTER:
           Address       ==>
           Remark        ==>

         Our SVCDUMP name has been filled in from the previous SETDEF
         processing.  We can press enter which will allow us to
         browse the area of the current location (variable X)
         or we can place a value (such as 00000010.) in the
         address pointer and press enter.  The remark field will
         allow us to place our own meaningful comments on these
         pointer stack entries.  After we press enter we will be
         able to inspect that storage area.  Some of the commands
         we can do are:


         1) Place the '%' sign in front of an address to go to
            that location using 24-BIT addressing mode
            (such as the MVS system CVT):


            ASID(X'0037') STORAGE  -----------------------------
            COMMAND ===>


            00000010 % 00FD5780   00000000   070C0000   811BBF26
            00000020   070C1000   81DF2B14   070C0000   81DF0CE0


            The IPCS reply shows us the storage at this
            address:

            ASID(X'0037') STORAGE  -----------------------------
            COMMAND ===>

            00FD5780   00000218   00FEEEC0   00FD8C44   00FD5D60
            00FD5790   00000000   00FF6100   00FF347E   00FE7AEE


            TO REFERENCE A 31-BIT ADDRESS ALL WE NEED TO DO IS
            USE THE '?' SYMBOL.



         After displaying location 00000010. and leaving the BROWSE
         we can now display the symbols on our BROWSE stack (see
         below):

         Using The IPCS/ESA ISPF Dialogs                     Page #3



         DSNAME('USERID.SVCDUMP.S0B0') POINTERS ------------------------
         COMMAND ===>

         ASID(X'0037') IS THE DEFAULT ADDRESS SPACE
         PTR   ADDRESS  ADDRESS SPACE                       DATA TYPE
         00001 00000010 ASID(X'0037')                       AREA
               REMARKS:
         00002 00FD5780 ASID(X'0037')                       AREA
               REMARKS:
         ************************* END OF POINTER STACK ****************


         Our previous two BROWSE dialog displays now have stack pointer
         addresses again should we desire to look at them again (enter
         the 'S' letter at the first position of the PTR value to do
         this).  We can also repeat a value by typing the 'R' command
         over the first 0 in the second PTR field. This will give us the
         following result:


         DSNAME('USERID.SVCDUMP.S0B0') POINTERS ------------------------
         COMMAND ===>

         ASID(X'0037') IS THE DEFAULT ADDRESS SPACE
         PTR   ADDRESS  ADDRESS SPACE                            DATA TY
         00001 00000010 ASID(X'0037')                            AREA
               REMARKS:
         00002 00FD5780 ASID(X'0037')                            AREA
               REMARKS:
         00002 00FD5780 ASID(X'0037')                            AREA
               REMARKS:
         ************************* END OF POINTER STACK ****************

         Now you can update one or the other of these two duplicate
         entries to your liking.


         There is another BROWSE option called 'F' which will invoke a I
         control block formatting service command (CBFORMAT) and provide
         us a formatted CVT.  To do this we will edit our last entry
         to change the AREA data type to STRUCTURE(CVT) to inform IPCS
         that this address in the beginning of a MVS control block
         called the Communications Vector Table (CVT) using the IPCS
         formatting program.  This command is the letter "E" which
         will give us the following IPCS screen

         Using The IPCS/ESA ISPF Dialogs                     Page #4



          EDIT DSNAME('USERID.SVCDUMP.S0B0') POINTER 00003 ---------
          COMMAND ==>

           Enter/verify attributes of the pointer.

           Use ENTER to view updated definition,
               END to save pointer and return,
               CANCEL to return without saving changes.

           Address       ===> 00FD5780
           Address space ===> ASID(X'0037')
           Data type     ===> STRUCTURE(CVT)
           Remarks       ===>


         After we change the data type from AREA to STRUCTURE(CVT) and
         press END we get our stack pointer panel:


         DSNAME('USERID.SVCDUMP.S0B0') POINTERS ------------------------
         COMMAND ===>

         ASID(X'0037') IS THE DEFAULT ADDRESS SPACE
         PTR   ADDRESS  ADDRESS SPACE                       DATA TYPE
         00001 00000010 ASID(X'0037')                       AREA
               REMARKS:
         00002 00FD5780 ASID(X'0037')                       AREA
               REMARKS:
         00003 00FD5780 ASID(X'0037')                       STRUCTURE(CV
               REMARKS:
         ************************* END OF POINTER STACK ****************


         When we enter the 'F' command to the last entry we will get
         a formatted CVT.  How elegant!  Some other symbols you can use
         to manipulate the stack pointers are:

         1) D  -  Delete the stack pointer

         2) I  -  Insert a stack pointer


         The BROWSE dialog facility will almost obsolete the old IPCS
         LIST command due to its flexibility.

         Option 2 on the IPCS primary option menu is the ANALYSIS
         dialog:


         ----------- IPCS MVS ANALYSIS OF DUMP CONTENTS ------------
         OPTION  ===>

         To display information, specify the corresponding option number

            1  SYMPTOMS    - Symptoms
            2  STATUS      - System environment summary
            3  WORKSHEET   - System environment worksheet
            4  SUMMARY     - Address spaces and tasks
            5  CONTENTION  - Resource contention
            6  COMPONENT   - MVS component data
            7  TRACES      - Trace formatting

         Enter END command to terminate MVS dump analysis.


         You can perform the following analyses without
         knowing the details of many IPCS commands.  The
         SYMPTOMS description may save you many hours
         of debugging analysis due to the many diagnostic
         functions it performs for you.


         For MVS/ESA VERSION 4 the manuals are:  MVS/ESA
         Diagnosis: System Reference (LY28-1820),
         MVS/ESA Diagnosis: Using Dumps and Traces (LY28-1813)
         and MVS/ESA Basics of Problem Determination (GC28-1839)
         for more information on how to read SYMPTOM data.


         BE AWARE THAT ALL OPTIONS EXCEPT SYMPTOMS WILL
         TAKE A LONG TIME TO EXECUTE ON YOUR TSO TERMINAL!
         IT MAY BE BETTER TO RUN THESE COMMANDS USING
         IPCS IN BATCH TSO.


         I want to give a special thanks to Ms. Ingrid Hines who is an
         IBM Advisory Software Support Specialist and Mr. Jim Chabot
         an IBM IPCS instructor for their careful review of this
         article.


         In a future article, I will go through some of my
         favorite IPCS commands used in problem determination
         and resolution.  See you then.
