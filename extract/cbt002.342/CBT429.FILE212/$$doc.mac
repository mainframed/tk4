                 CDCSA DB2 CROSS SYSTEM FACILITY

Overall Description.

     The CDCSA DB2 Cross System Facility is an ISPF application
which is designed to help keep DB2 maintenance in one place, and
clone it over to be used by many DB2 address spaces.  This
application is constructed to keep proper documentation of the
maintenance levels on each system that is being run.  There are
some other aspects of this system, as you can discover while you
examine it.

     This system makes life much easier in our internal
service bureau environment that is commonly found nowadays in
state governments, large city governments, and corporations that
have combined separate data centers.  We can do DB2 maintenance
in a standard way.

     This system is an outgrowth of the MVS Cross System Facility
that is on File 204 of this tape.  If perchance, something seems
to be missing from here, go look there.

     Some of the overall philosophy of this system is documented
in the SCRIPT file which is on CBT Tape File 213.

     A word about naming conventions:  Most of the members of this
pds:  CHANGES, CLIST, etc. are IEBUPDTE-unloaded pds'es themselves.
They can be properly restored using the PDSLOAD program from File
093 of this tape.  A load module for PDSLOAD may be found on File
035 of this tape.  A sample PDSLOAD job is member $PDSLOAD on this
file.  PDSLOAD will restore each member's ISPF statistics.  If you
use IEBUPDTE, the ISPF statistics will not be stowed.  The original
name for each of these pds'es was prefixed by XDB2.TSOISPF.
Therefore, the original name for the library whose name here is
CLIST, was "XDB2.TSOISPF.CLIST".  You get the point.  These full
names will be mentioned throughout this package, and you must make
global changes to the XDB2.TSOISPF prefix to adapt the package to
your own system's naming conventions.  Any references to datasets
called XSYS.MVSESA.* refer to materials found on File 204.

     All 80-byte LRECL pds'es from the package have been made into
members on this file.  There was one other pds, called XDB2.SCRIPT,
whose LRECL is 147 and which will be separately placed in File 213
of the CBT Tape.  XDB2.SCRIPT.IMBEDS is on this file, as member,
IMBEDS.

     To set up this package, look at member XDBSALC in the CLIST
library.  The CLIST "XDBSALC" sets everything else in motion.  Things
start from there.  It should be obvious how the libraries ought to be
set up.  As we mentioned before, you have to make global changes
to the dataset prefix names when you set this up on your own system.
To my knowledge, these names are hard coded.  If you think some of
the ingredients are missing, please call Sam Golob at 718-403-8666
or at 908-901-0943.  Or call Ken Tomiak at 718-403-8612.  Before you
call us, check on File 204 of this tape first.

     I think the most immediately interesting part of this system
is the M option to generate the JCL that does the DB2 maintenance
cloning.  The other things are convenient add-ons in my opinion,
although I am glad they are there.

     To run the cloning jobs, you have to set up the CHANGES library,
because this library may be automatically updated every time you run
a cloning job.

     The MVS Cross System package from File 204 was written by Joel
Perlman and Ken Tomiak at CDCSA (Computer and Data Communicatons
Services Agency) of New York City, while they were working for IBM and
under contract to New York City.  This DB2 package was adapted by Ken
Tomiak from that package.  All the requisite permissions for inclusion
on the CBT MVS Utilities Tape, to my best knowledge, have been
granted.

     Neither Ken Tomiak nor I is at CDCSA any more.  If you have
questions, please contact:
