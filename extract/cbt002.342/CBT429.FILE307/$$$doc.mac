This is a program called IEV90, which calls the High Level Assembler
whenever the old Assembler H (PGM=IEV90) is asked for in a job.
The purpose of this program is to make the transition easier, from
the old assembler, IEV90, to the new assembler, ASMA90.  After
assembling and link-editing, you put this program into the link list.

This program was taken from a discussion on the IBM-MAIN forum on
the Internet.  See File 001 for some instruction on how to subscribe
to this forum.  You have to send email to LISTSERV@UA1VM.UA.EDU which
says (I think):   subscribe your-name IBM-MAIN
and you'll get further instructions back.  It is an automatic process.
You'll then get possibly 40-50 email messages daily, about MVS subjects.

We put the following program in linklib when we got rid of Assembler H
and haven't really noticed any problems or complaints:
