Sam,
This is the updated source that should allow for 4-digit unit numbers.
This is member DITTPARM of the source library.

I will send you one more e-mail that has the updated source for the
TSO environment.  In TSO mode, DITTO will display the allocated devices
on the main ISPF panel.  It was showing only 3 digits.  It will now
show all four.
