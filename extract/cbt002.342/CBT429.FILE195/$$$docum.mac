"HANDY CLIST" PACKAGE.

   This small collection of CLISTs accomplishes handy things in a
   surprisingly simple way.  In several of these CLISTs, uncanny
   advantage is taken of the ISPF "SELECT" service.  If you look
   at the CLISTs, you'll see that most of them are 'no brainers',
   but boy do they work!

   Contents of the collection is as follows:


   $ELECT   -  Generalized CLIST to invoke the ISPF SELECT service.
               This works for programs, panels, and commands.

   COMPRESS -  CLIST to accomplish the compression of a pds, using
               shared allocation only.  Works only under ISPF.
               Authorization is retained because the ISPF SELECT
               service is used to call IEBCOPY.

   LOGOF    -  Fixes "fat finger" errors when logging off TSO.
               'No brainer' number one.

   LOGO     _    an alias for LOGOF

   X        _    an alias for LOGOF

   RELOG    -  Logs the current user back on to TSO with killing
               the current address space.

   T$TDIALG -  Enters ISPF dialog manager test function for the
               current application.  Like PDF option 7, but not
               APPLID(ISR).

   WHOAMI   -  The 'no brainer' of them all, but handy.
               Tells you who is logged on to the tube.
