       THIS IS PARTIAL DOCUMENTATION FOR CHUCK GLASS'S SYMTAPE
         PACKAGE.  IT IS QUITE SIMPLE TO USE.  THERE ARE 3 PARTS:

  PART 1)  ASSEMBLER PROGRAM - YOU READ THE SYM TAPES IN, AND THIS
              PROGRAM CREATES ENTRIES IN A SPECIAL DATA FILE.
              SEE THE DCB'S IN THE SOURCE FOR ATTRIBUTES..

  PART 2)  JCL TO RUN THE ASSEMBLER PROGRAM AND READ THE TAPES IN.
              THE DATA FILE MUST BE PREALLOCATED.  SEE DCB INFO IN
              THE SOURCE LISTING.

  PART 3)  CLIST:

     CLIST SRCIDX SEARCHES THE DATASET
          'WUI.SRCIDX.DATA' WHICH WAS CREATED TO
          HAVE LOCATIONS OF ALL AVAILABLE SOURCE
          MODULES. THIS CLIST WILL CHECK THAT LIST
          FOR THE LOCATION OF A PARTICULAR MODULE
          AND THEN GENERATE THE JCL REQUIRED TO LIST
          IT FOR YOU.
