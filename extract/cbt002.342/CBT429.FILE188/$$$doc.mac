 INTRODUCTION.  ALMOST EVERYBODY WHO INSTALLS MVS GETS THIS WHOLE
       COLLECTION OF OPTIONAL MATERIAL (SOURCE TAPES) FROM IBM, WHICH
       HE ALMOST NEVER USES, UNLESS HE IS ONE OF THE FEW WHO HAS
       OCCASION TO REFER TO THEM.  THERE ARE A LOT OF TAPES, FIRST
       OF ALL.  SECOND OF ALL, MANY OF THE MODULES QUICKLY BECOME
       OBSOLETE, BECAUSE OF NEW PTF LEVELS OF THE MODULE.  THE MOST
       USEFUL PARTS OF THE COLLECTION ARE PROBABLY THE IBM PRIVATE
       MACROS, WHICH ONE MAY SOMETIMES USE TO WRITE SYSTEM CODE, AND
       THE ASSEMBLER LANGUAGE CODE FOR SYSTEM TABLES, SUCH AS IKJEFTE2
       AND THE LIKE, WHICH CAN BE USED TO CODE USERMODS TO THE SYSTEM,
       SAY, IF YOU WANT TO EXPAND THE TABLE.

    IT IS NICE TO SEE HOW IBM CODED SOMETHING.  EVEN IF THINK YOU CAN
       ACHIEVE THE SAME EFFECT BY IMITATION, OR BY LOOKING AT A LOAD
       MODULE VERSION, IT ALWAYS HELPS TO HAVE THE ORIGINAL SOURCE
       AT HAND.  YOU CAN SOMETIMES GET GOOD IDEAS FROM THEM ALSO.
       I'M NOT EXCLUDING THE USE OF FICHE--FICHE USUALLY MORE CURRENT.
       SOMETIMES YOU JUST WOULD LIKE MACHINE-READABLE CODE.  OUR THING
       IS TO MAKE USE OF THIS OFT-NEGLECTED RESOURCE.

    MY SYSTEM MAKES ANY PART OF THIS SOURCE EASILY ACCESSIBLE.

    ANOTHER SYSTEM, WHICH WAS WRITTEN BY CHUCK GLASS OF WESTERN UNION
       INTERNATIONAL, DOES THE SAME KIND OF THING, ALTHOUGH IT IS
       COMPLETELY DIFFERENT IN DESIGN.  CHUCK IS A FRIEND OF MINE,
       AND I'M SENDING HIS SYSTEM TO ARNIE TOGETHER WITH MINE (ON A
       DIFFERENT FILE).  YOU CAN TAKE YOUR CHOICE AS TO WHAT'S MORE
       CONVENIENT TO SET UP AND USE.  (IT'S ON THIS FILE AS
       ALL THE "CHUCK" STUFF.)

    PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CALL ME IF YOU HAVE SUGGESTIONS OR COMMENTS.
