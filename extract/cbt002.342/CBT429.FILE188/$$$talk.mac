    SYMTAPE   -    DISCUSSION OF SOURCE TAPE HANDLING SYSTEM.
                                                (SAM GOLOB'S SYSTEM)

      MY SYSTEM FOR HANDLING THE IBM SOURCE (OPTIONAL MATERIAL) TAPES
 CONSISTS OF TWO PARTS:  MAPPING, AND OPTIONALLY, CONDENSING.

 MAPPING:

      MAPPING CONSISTS OF CREATING A PDS CAPABLE OF CONTAINING LISTINGS.
 I CALL MINE 'TST.SYMTAPE.MAPS' .   DCB PARAMETERS ARE:  RECFM=FBA,
 LRECL=133, BLKSIZE=3059, OR SOME OTHER MULTIPLE OF 133.  I PREALLOCATE
 IT.  THEN I ASSIGN VOLUME SERIALS TO ALL OF MY SYMBOLIC TAPES AND PUT
 PAPER LABELS ON THEM.  FINALLY, I RUN ALL OF THE TAPES THROUGH THE JOB
 CALLED "TAPEMAPS" IN THIS FILE AND FILL THAT PDS WITH DATA FROM
 MY TAPES.  THEN I CAN USE THE PDS COMMAND (FILE 182 OF THE CBT TAPE)
 TO FIND WHICH TAPE ANY MEMBER IS ON.  THIS IS BECAUSE THE SYMBOLIC
 TAPES ARE IN IEBUPDTE SYSIN FORMAT, AND DAVE COLE'S MAPPING PROGRAM
 (FILE 299) LISTS ALL OF THE MEMBER NAMES IN ITS SECOND REPORT.
 IT'S EASY TO FIND A MEMBER IF YOU HAVE PDS INSTALLED.  SAY, TO FIND
 IKJEFT02, JUST GET INTO "PDS" FOR YOUR TAPEMAP LISTING PDS, AND ENTER
             FIND : /IKJEFT02/
 IT'S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.  ALL THE TAPES THAT IKJEFT02 IS ON, WILL SHOW
 UP AS MEMBERS.  JUST BROWSE (OR "REVIEW") THAT MEMBER AND FIND OUT
 WHICH FILE TO RELOAD FROM THE TAPE.  USE IEBUPDTE OR "PDSLOAD", TO DO
 THE FILE RELOAD.  (SOURCE IS INCLUDED FOR REVIEW, DSCOPY, AND PDSLOAD.)

 CONDENSING:

      IF YOU'RE SATISFIED WITH KEEPING 30 OR SO TAPES AROUND, LEAVE IT
 AT THAT.  I HAVE A PROBLEM AT NEWSWEEK, KEEPING 30 TAPES IN THE
 COMPUTER ROOM--THERE'S NO SPACE.  MY SOLUTION WAS TO USE THE CBT TAPE
 COMPRESS PROGRAM CBT973 TO COMPRESS THE IEBUPDTE SYSIN FILES ON TO
 6 3600-FOOT SUPER REELS, AND KEEP THEM IN THE COMPUTER ROOM.  STANDARD
 LABELS ON THE COMPRESSED TAPE FILES, AND AN ORGANIZED LABELING SYSTEM
 ENABLE A QUICK UNLOAD OF ANY FILE NEEDED FROM THESE SIX TAPES.
 THE SIX JOBS CBTSYM1 THRU CBTSYM6, AND THE CBTUNLD JOB PROVIDE
 PROTOTYPES FOR WHAT I DID.  I HAD TO RELY HEAVILY ON THE TAPEMAP
 LISTING PDS.  THE FIRST THING I DID WAS TO READ ALL THE ORIGINAL SYM
 TAPES INTO THE TAPEMAPS JOB--EVERYTHING DONE BEFORE IS PREREQUISITE
 FOR THE CONDENSE.  THEN I PLANNED.

      THE CBT973 PROGRAM SAVES TAPE FOOTAGE BY A FACTOR OF ABOUT .55,
 CONSIDERING THE BLOCKSIZES WE'RE DEALING WITH (SEE THE "CBT" JOBS).
 AFTER RUNNING THE TAPE MAPS, I CAN KNOW THE APPROXIMATE FOOTAGE OF
 THE FILES ON THE SYM TAPE.  SOMEWHAT MORE THAN 4000 TOTAL FEET WILL
 CONDENSE ON TO A 2400 FOOT REEL, AND ABOUT 6000 FEET WILL CONDENSE
 ONTO A 3600 FOOT REEL.  BY LOOKING AT THE MAPS, I CAN FIT AS MANY
 TAPES AS POSSIBLE ONTO A CONDENSED REEL.  ON MY SAMPLE LISTING PDS,
 YOU CAN SEE THE MEMBER $SYMCMPR I'VE CREATED TO SHOW MY ORGANIZATION.
 IT'S SELF-EXPLANATORY.  (ANYBODY WITH MVS SP 1.3.0 THRU SP 1.3.3 WILL
 HAVE SIMILAR TAPES, SO MAYBE YOU CAN USE MY LISTING PDS FOR REFERENCE.)
 YOU CAN USE THE CBTSYM JOBS TO COMPRESS YOUR TAPES (IF YOU HAVE 3600
 FOOT REELS--FOR 2400 FOOT YOU'LL HAVE TO RECALCULATE), AND WITH THE
 AID OF THE $SYMCMPR MEMBER OF THE PDS, YOU CAN USE THE CBTUNLD JOB
 TO QUICKLY OBTAIN THE EXPANDED FORM OF ANY FILE YOU CHOOSE, ON DISK.

      ACTUALLY COMPRESSING THE TAPES IS HARD WORK.  SINCE THE INPUT
 TAPES ARE NON-LABELED, YOU MUST BE EXCEEDINGLY CAREFUL THAT THE RIGHT
 TAPES ARE LOADED AT THE RIGHT TIME.  THE ACTUAL COMPRESS TAKES TIME
 TOO.  A SAVING FACTOR IS THAT THE DECOMPRESS IS QUICK, WHEN YOU'LL
 NEED THE FILES LATER.


 NOTES:

      COMPRESSING THE TAPES MAKES THEM TRANSPORTABLE.  SIX TAPES ARE
 EASIER TO MOVE THAN ARE 30.  THEY CAN BE COPIED WITH COPYMODS OR WITH
 COPYFILE (CBT TAPE FILE 316).  COPYMODS COPIES ENTIRE CONTENTS
 INCLUDING LABELS.  COPYFILE COPIES STANDARD-LABEL TAPES.  (I'M
 INCLUDING ASSEMBLER SOURCE FOR THESE PROGRAMS--COPYMODS SHOULD
 ASSEMBLE CLEAN.  MACROS FOR COPYFILE, IF NECESSARY, ARE ON FILE 316.
 SAMPLE JCL FOR THEM IS ON THIS PDS.)

      I'VE TRIED TO MAKE THIS PACKAGE AS SELF-CONTAINED AS POSSIBLE
 AND HAVE INCLUDED ASSEMBLER SOURCE FOR SEVERAL OF THE PROGRAMS THAT
 ARE NEEDED, EVEN THOUGH THEY CAN BE FOUND ON OTHER FILES OF THE CBT
 TAPE.  THE VERSIONS FOUND HERE REFLECT THE LEVELS OF THESE PROGRAMS
 THAT ORIGINALLY WORKED FOR ME WHEN I SET UP THIS SYSTEM AT NEWSWEEK.
 PDS IS NOT INCLUDED, BECAUSE IT IS LARGE.  IT'S BEST TO INSTALL IT
 FROM FILES 182 AND 296 OF THE CBT TAPE, AND TO CUSTOMIZE IT TO YOUR
 INSTALLATION'S PREFERENCES.  FOR QUICK AND DIRTY, IF YOU HAVE ISPF
 VERSION 2 YOU CAN USE THE LOAD MODULE ON FILE 35.  OTHERWISE, EDIT
 THE PDSGEN72 MEMBER AND ASSEMBLE PDS FROM FILE 182. TO USE THE OTHER
 PARTS OF PDS (RECOMMENDED) COPY THE PANELS INTO YOUR FAVORITE PANEL
 LIBRARY AND ASSEMBLE ALL THE UTILITIES IN FILE 296.  COPY HELP MEMBER
 TOO.  REMEMBER TO CUSTOMIZE IT CAREFULLY FROM MEMBER PDSGEN72.

      CHUCK'S PACKAGE IS INCLUDED IN UNDOCUMENTED FORM HERE AS MEMBERS
 CHUCK1, CHUCK2, AND CHUCK3 (RATHER EASY TO FIND).  I HOPE TO DOCUMENT
 IT AND INCLUDE IT AS A SEPARATE FILE.  DESIGN OF HIS SYSTEM IS
 APPROXIMATELY AS FOLLOWS:  HE ASSIGNS NAMES TO ALL OF HIS SYMBOL TAPES
 AND WRITES PAPER VOLUME LABELS ON ALL OF THEM (AS DO I IN MY SYSTEM).
 THEN HE READS THE TAPES INTO A SEQUENTIAL FILE, CREATED BY AN
 ASSEMBLER PROGRAM.  HE CAN RETRIEVE A SINGLE MODULE (NOT JUST AN
 ENTIRE PDS) BY USING A CLIST THAT READS HIS FILE.
