 ISPF Support for the QUEUE Command
 ----------------------------------

 This mod adds ISPF support for the JES2 2.2.0 version of the QUEUE
 command.  It was written to be as small as possible (to ease any
 maintenance burden it might cause) and therefore is not particularly
 elegant.

 The code replaces the queue display with one of four ISPF panels
 (depending on terminal model number).  Data stored in QCOMMON, which
 has been built as part of the information to be displayed via TPUT, is
 simply defined to ISPF and displayed via the DISPLAY service.

 Listed below are the members included in this mod.  Changes are marked
 "TEC" in positions 69 through 71 of each member.

   Member       Change
   ------       ------
   DISPLAY      Call ISPF to display information rather than TPUT;
                change ISPF scroll commands to QUEUE commands.

   INIT         Set flag and load ISPLINK if running under ISPF.

   QCOMMON      Add work area for ISPF constants, macros, etc.

   QUEUE        Skip VTAM macros if running under ISPF; set ISPF panel
                name depending on terminal model; define ISPF variables.

   REPOS        Change ISPF panel name when MODEL command is entered.

 The following members are not changes to the QUEUE command, but are
 needed for ISPF support:

   QUECMDS      Command table used when running the QUEUE command under
                ISPF NEWAPPL(QUE).  This permits QUEUE commands which
                conflict with ISPF commands (e.g., PRINT, LIST) to be
                used unchanged.

   QUEPROF      Default values for PFKs when running the QUEUE command
                under ISPF NEWAPPL(QUE).

   QUEUEM2      QUEUE ISPF panel for 3278 model 2.

   QUEUEM3      QUEUE ISPF panel for 3278 model 3.

   QUEUEM4      QUEUE ISPF panel for 3278 model 4.

   QUEUEM5      QUEUE ISPF panel for 3278 model 5.

 Installation Considerations
 ---------------------------

 1. The four panels above must be copied to an available ISPPLIB
    dataset.

 2. Members QUEPROF and QUEUECMDS should be copied to an available
    ISPTLIB dataset.  These members are used when running the QUEUE
    command under a separate ISPF application named "QUE".  QUEUE can
    be invoked as a separate ISPF application by:

    o Coding a CLIST with:

        ISPEXEC SELECT CMD(QUEUE) MODE(FSCR) NEWAPPL(QUE)

    o Adding an option to an ISPF selection panel:

        Q,'CMD(QUEUE &ZPARM) MODE(FSCR) NEWAPPL(QUE)'

 3. ISPF support in QUEUE will work if QUEUE is invoked by just
    entering "TSO QUEUE" on any ISPF command line, but this has the
    following drawbacks:

    o The PFKs will be that of the current ISPF application (most likely
      ISR) and will not therefore be very useful in QUEUE.

    o The scroll keys will not work.  (This could have been rectified by
      additional mods to QUEUE and a change to the ISP command table,
      but I thought the other way, running QUEUE as a separate ISPF
      application, was sufficient.)

 4. The default PFKs in member QUEPROF are the same as those in QUEUE.
    I would suggest, however, that one key be changed to RETRIEVE (if
    running under ISPF 2.3).  This permits the last QUEUE command to be
    retrieved and modified.

 5. I tried to design the panels to include the best of both QUEUE and
    ISPF, so they do not look like the regular QUEUE display.

 6. This code does not take ISPF split screen into consideration.  For
    example, if QUEUE is invoked from the bottom ISPF screen, one or
    more lines will be missing, depending on where the split is.  I
    looked briefly at how to allow for this, and decided it would be
    more trouble than it would be worth.  One way around this problem
    (if you are running on other than a model 2) is to issue the MODEL 2
    command.  This forces QUEUE to use a smaller panel.  Of course, if
    you are not in split screen, the problem does not exist.
