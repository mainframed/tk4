°          This  is a dialog which can be used to keep track of updates
°          to the TSO broadcast dataset.  It stores  information  about
°          each  message  in  an  ISPF table, and stores each broadcast
°          message as a PDS member.  Messages can be  added,  modified,
°          or  deleted;  entry and update of messages is via ISPF EDIT.
°          Messages are given an expiration date and  will  be  removed
°          from  the  broadcast dataset the next time the dialog is in-
°          voked (and a broadcast message is changed) after the expira-
°          tion date.

°          This dialog can be used to edit a command  table,  including
°          ISRCMDS  and ISPCMDS.  This done by copying the table to the
°          user's profile dataset (assumed to be  allocated  to  DDNAME
°          ISPTABL)  and  invoking the ISPF command table edit program,
°          ISPUCM, against it.  If the table is changed by ISPUCM, then
°          it is copied back to its source.  ISPF must be  recycled  to
°          see the effects of the change.

°          This  is  an  ISPF dialog to display MVS console information
°          (as in SPY).  If the invoker is authorized (has OPER author-
°          ity), then MVS commands may also be entered.  I didn't write
°          this myself.  I got it from a mods tape  (probably  the  CBT
°          tape)  and  modified  it  for  extended data stream consoles
°          (e.g., 3290s and 3179s) and for MVS SP 2.2.0.   There are  a
°          lot of ways to enter MVS commands and get responses nowdays,
°          but  we  still  like  this  way best.   This code works with
°          MVS/SP 3.1.0e (MVS/ESA).


°          This dialog is mostly just a panel which facilitates the use
°          of  the  PC3270  file  transfer program while in ISPF.   The
°          panel has tutorial panels which give syntax and samples  for
°          the PC SEND and RECEIVE commands.

°          The  dialog  is invoked by entering "pc" on the command line
°          of the bottom panel of ISPF.  A command table  entry  causes
°          the CLIST VPCC to be invoked.  This CLIST displays panel VPC
°          which  puts  the  command  line  at  the bottom (required by
°          IND$FILE).  The user can now enter the SEND or RECEIVE  com-
°          mand on his DOS screen.

°          When  the file transfer program enters "IND$FILE ..." on the
°          ISPF the command line, a command table entry invokes a CLIST
°          (VPCTRAN)  which  actually  invokes  the  IND$FILE  command.
°          VPCTRAN is based on ADMUPCFT from IBM via GDDM.

°          entering  "logoff"  to  terminate  ISPF and log the user off
°          TSO, or "logon" to terminate ISPF, log the user off TSO, and

°          This program can be used, when converting TSO logon informa-
°          tion  from  SYS1.UADS to RACF, to migrate the first TSO com-

°          Input  is  a  flat  file of 172 byte SYS1.UADS records.  You
°          should concatenate all SYS1.UADS members to provide this in-
°          put.

°          When the program finds a TSO command to be  issued,  it  up-
°          dates  the  appropriate field in the RACF data base, so that
°          this command will not be lost  across  the  conversion  from
°          SYS1.UADS to RACF.

°          _______________________

°          This is an ISPF dialog to facilitate the updating of certain
°          TSO  logon  information fields.  Some of these fields can be
°          updated from the TSO/E fullscreen logon panel, but  many  of
°          our  TSO  users never see this panel, as we have a windowing
°          package which automatically supplies their password.   Also,
°          it's  more  convenient to change these fields when you think
°          of it, rather than having to wait until your next LOGON.

°          Information which may be updated in this dialog is:

°          ø   Name

°          ø   Station (first four bytes of installation data)

°          ø   Account

°          ø   Logon procedure

°          ø   Initial command

°          All of the above are the  standard  RACF  data  base  fields
°          TSO/E  uses  after  the  conversion  from SYS1.UADS to RACF.
°          (Each shop will of course have its own uses for installation
°          data.)

°          Fields which require RACF authorization to use specific val-
°          ues will be checked and error messages issued if the user is
°          not authorized.  For example, if you try to change to an in-
°          valid account code (i.e., an account  code  not  defined  to
°          RACF) you will get an error message.

°          You  will  not be able to use this code as written as it has
°          some local dependencies (most of which are in  the  text  of
°          the  ISPF messages).   There shouldn't be TOO much to change
°          though.

°          Member VLOGONP should be renamed VLOGON when stored in  your
°          panel  library.    This  panel  references a tutorial panel,
°          VLOGONT, which is not supplied.

°          Since this dialog uses RACF internal macros, it must be  au-
°          thorized.  Since ISPF services cannot be invoked from an au-
°          thorized   program,   you   must  use  something  (e.g.,  an
°          authorization SVC) to flip the authorization bit on and off.
°          This code uses SVC 255.  You will have to change this to use
°          your authorization mechanism.

°          The following are known limitations  and  possible  problems
°          with these mods:

°          ø   The  broadcast message dialog invokes a program, A75905,
°              to to put the value from the programmer's name field  of
°              the current TSO session in the variable XNAME, and even-
°              tually into the broadcast message itself.  I did not in-
°              clude  the code for this program.  You may have your own
°              way of doing this or you could just display a  panel  to
°              prompt for name.

°          ø   CDF uses SVC 255 (not included) to flip authorization on
°              and  off.   You will probably have to change the code to
°              use your authorization SVC (see below).

°          ø   The IND$FILE CLIST, which is  invoked  by  the  PC  File
°              transfer  dialog,  is taken from IBM-supplied GDDM CLIST
°              ADMUPCFT.  I have never actually tried to  use  this  to
°              send  and receive graphics data.  If I recall correctly,
°              we were at one time just invoking the  IND$FILE  command
°              directly  (in the command table) instead of via a CLIST.
°              This should still work if you don't have (or care about)
°              GDDM, although the messages I added to ADMUPCFT will  of
°              course not show up.

°          ø   The  tutorial  panels  for the three edit macros are de-
°              signed to be displayed from EDIT tutorial  panels.    If
°              you  have  your  own panel listing your edit macros, you
°              can add references to these there.

°          ø   The  SPELL  edit  macro  requires  that  IBM's  Document
°              Compsition  Facility  (SCRIPT) be installed on your sys-
°              tem.

°          ø   The LOGOFF dialog has a glitch in that  after  the  user
°              has  been  in  certain programs (e.g., CDF), the TSOEXEC
°              command (issued by the VLOGOFF CLIST) gets a return code
°              of 20 and fails.  Reissueing the commond  works  OK  but
°              there doesn't seem to be any way to get rid of the nasty
°              message the first command generates.

¸
°               TECZ00

°          4.  Edit  member VISPFG2 to reflect the name of your GDDMSAM
°              library, GDDM load library, and  ISPF  load  module  li-
°              brary.   Then submit the member to compile and link edit
°              program VISPFG2.

°          5.  Add a selection for the TEC mods panel to  one  of  your
°              selection panels:

°                  nn,'PANEL(TECMODS)'

°              where  "nn" is the selection number for the TEC mods.  I
°              included the TEC mods panel as an example of how to  in-
°              voke  four of the mods.  You would probably want to just
°              put selections on one of you own panels to select  which
°              ever mods (if any) you want to use.

°          6.  Assemble  VUTL16 and link edit (with ISPLINK) into a TSO
°              STEPLIB or LNKLST library.

°          7.  Change the authorization mechanism in CDF.    Currently,
°              it uses an SVC (255) to become temporarily authorized in
°              order  to  do cross memory moves of console information.
°              (ISPF will not permit AC=1 modules to invoke  ISPF  ser-
°              vices.)    If  you have this SVC and it is invoked as in
°              CDF then you are OK.  Otherwise, you will have to change
°              the code to use your authorization SVC (at source state-
°              ments 355, 429, 521, and 530).

°              Assemble CDF and link edit (with  ISPLINK)  into  a  TSO
°              STEPLIB or LNKLST library.

°          8.  Change  panel  CDFHELP to conform to you console config-
°              uration.   If you have more than  one  MVS  system,  you
°              might  want to change panel CDFDATAB to invoke a differ-
°              ent tutorial panel depending on which system you're run-
°              ning on.

°          9.  Make the following entries in your command table:
°                .... IND$FILE  0  SELECT CMD(%VPCTRAN &ZPARM)
°                .... EXIT      0  SELECT CMD(%VEXITC &ZPARM) MODE(FSCR)
°                .... LOGO      0  SELECT CMD(%VLOGOC &ZPARM) NEWAPPL(IS
°                .... LOGOFF    0  SELECT CMD(%VEXITC LOGOFF &ZPARM) MOD
°                .... LOGON     0  SELECT CMD(%VEXITC LOGON NEWID(&ZPARM
°                .... PC        0  SELECT CMD(%VPCC) NEWAPPL(ISR)
°              You could use option 2 from the TEC  mods  panel  to  do
°              this.

°          10. Invoke  CLIST  VBROADI to create and initialize the ISPF
°              table dataset used by the broadcast dataset update  dia-
°              log.    This  CLIST  creates  a PDS MVS.BRODCAST; if you
°              change the name here you need  to  change  the  name  in
°              CLIST VBROAD also.

°          11. Use  the  documentation  in member $$ISPF as a guide for
°              installing ISPF support in QUEUE.

°          12. Edit member RACFTSO5 and submit to copy TSO initial com-
°              mand from SYS1.UADS to RACF.  This job should be run af-
°              ter the RACONVRT command.

°          13. Edit  and  submit member VLOGON to install the TSO logon
°              update dialog.  Modify an ISPF selection panel to invoke
°              program VLOGON. E.g.,:

°                 11,'PGM(VLOGON)'

°                We modified panel ISPOPTA.
