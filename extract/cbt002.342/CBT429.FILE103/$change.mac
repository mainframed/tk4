Changes to these mods:

11/27/1989

  1. Added missing edit macro VBROADE.

  2. Added CLIST VBROADI which can be used to initialize the ISPF
     table used by the broadcast dataset dialog.

  3. Added mods to QUEUE command for ISPF support.  There are several
     version of QUEUE ISPF support on the CBT tape now, but I don't
     know what they look like as I only have the fiche.  This mod is
     quite small and easily (I hope) reworked; included are modified
     QUEUE source modules (DISPLAY, INIT, QCOMMON, QUEUE, REPOS), ISPF
     panels, etc.

  4. Added a program which may be used to copy each user's initial TSO
     command from SYS1.UADS to RACF.  This is useful after running the
     RACONVRT command which copies most everything else.

  5. Added an ISPF dialog which will update TSO logon information in
     RACF.  These are fields which can be changed from the TSO/E logon
     panel, but many of our users never see the TSO/E panel because
     of a logon script.
