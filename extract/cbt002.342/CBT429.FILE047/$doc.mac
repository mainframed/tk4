===> MEMBER LIST COMPLETE

THE MEMBERS: LISTICAT, NOCELL, RMFIII AND SMPELIST
ARE SELF-CONTAINED APPLICATIONS WITH EACH ONE HAVING (I HOPE)
ALL THE REQUIRED PARTS.

   NOCELL - A VTOC AND TAPE CATALOG LISTER
   LISTICAT - A CONDENSED LISTING OF CATALOG ENTRIES
   RMFIII   - A POST PROCESSOR FOR RMF MONITOR III DATA
   SMPELIST - A CONDENSED LISTING OF SMPCSI ENTRIES

I HAVE BEEN CARRYING THESE THINGS AROUND FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS
AND I HAVEN'T HAD TIME TO DO MUCH WORK ON THEM. THEY STILL RUN
PROPERLY ON MY CURRENT SYSTEM AT THE FOLLOWING LEVELS:

   MVS/ESA 3.1.3
   DFP     2.2.0
   ISPF    3.5.0
   DFHSM   2.6.0

I HOPE TO BE CONVERTED FULLY TO DFSMS IN ANOTHER MONTH OR SO
AND I PLAN TO UPDATE NOCELL AND LISTICAT AS REQUIRED AT THAT TIME.
