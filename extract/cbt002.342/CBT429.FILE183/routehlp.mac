 FUNCTION = The ROUTE EDIT macro prints the data currently being edited.
            Although it can be used as an alternative to PRINTDS, PRINTO
            or the various PRINT functions of ISPF/PDF, ROUTE is particu
            useful to print data that does not exist on disk in a printa
            form, such as packed data, data modified during the current
            session, or data only accessible via the EDIT Interface (EDI

 OPERANDS

              Destination is the name of the JES printer on
                  which the hardcopy will be created.
                  It must be coded like the DEST key-word of
                  a DD statement or ALLOCATE command.
                  For a local printer, specify LOCAL or R0.
                  Examples: R4, L3287, PROD.X3700, N5R22, RMT35
                  Destination defaults to LOCAL if CLASS is
                  specified; otherwise, it must be specified.
                  The destination may also be specified as
                  DEST(destination).
                  If the destination is a work-station file name
                  such as c:\abcdef.txt or /usr/etc/abcdef.txt
                  then the FILEXFER service is used to transfer
                  the data to the corresponding WS file.
              first and last are labels that define the range
                  of lines to be printed.  Any currently defined
                  label is valid, e.g. .ZF .ZCSR .HERE, etc
                  A range can alternatively be specified using
                  C/CC or M/MM line commands.  Specification of
                  a range is optional.  If no range is
                  specified, the entire data set is printed.
              class optionally specifies the output class used
                  to allocate the SYSOUT data set.
                  If not specified, Default_class is used or,
                  if destination is present in the Default
                  Class Table, the associated class is used.
              copies optionally specifies the number of copies.
                  The default value is one.
              Output-descriptor is the name of an output descrip-
                  tor that will be associated with the SYSOUT
                  data set.  Output descriptors are created by
                  the // OUTPUT statement in the LOGON procedure
                  or the OUTDES command.
              Lines optionally specifies the number of lines
                  printed per page.
                  The default is Default_pagelen.
              Forms-number is a 4-character forms number
              HOLD Specifies that the output should be held in
                  the JES output queue until it is released.
              NOHOLD Specifies that the output should be made
                  available for printing immediately.
              FCB-number is a 4-character FCB number
              CCHAR is an optional key-word indicating that the
                  first byte of each record is a carriage
                  control character (ASA or machine).  ROUTE
                  inspects the first record to determine the
                  control character type (i.e. ASA or machine).
                  CCHAR implies NOTITLE.
              TITLE is a default key-word that needs only be
                  specified in conjunction with CCHAR.
              NOTITLE is an optional key-word that prevents a
                  title line from being printed at the beginning
                  of the print file to identify its contents.
              PORTRAIT and LANDSCAPE are optional key-words that
                  generate the character sequences to switch a
                  XEROX 3700 printer to portrait mode or
                  landscape mode at the beginning of the print
                  file, then switch it back to the default mode
                  at the end.

       Operands may be specified in any order.

       ROUTE was initially designed to print on RJE printers, which
       is why the destination parameter is mandatory.  To make the
       destination an optional parameter, set the Default_dest
       variable to the default destination (such as LOCAL or RMTnn).

       You may use the C or M line commands (in any form) to select
       a range of lines. If the M line command is used, the lines
       printed are deleted.

       When printing data that does not contain control characters,
       you may use the control word .SK in pos 1 of a line each
       time you want to start a new page.

       Routing to a work-station file requires an existing connection
       to the work-station agent (WSA).  Only the dest and debug
       parameters are allowed; all other parameters are ignored.

       You can invoke ROUTE from a REXX exec or CLIST to provide
       shortcuts or hide complex option strings.  The outer macro
       specifies additional operands as arguments to the ROUTE macro.
       For example, to relieve users from having to type WRITER(W132)
       when they print to an HP Laserjet, create a ROUTEJET macro as
       follows:

             "%ROUTE WRITER(W132)"; EXIT RC

     Examples:

       ROUTE R4

       ROUTE FLOOR1 COPIES(2) CCHAR

       ROUTE XRX3700 .A .B CLASS(Q) COPIES(3) NOTITLE PORTRAIT CCHAR

       ROUTE c:\temp\text.file debug
