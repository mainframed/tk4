Sam,
I can see what's wrong. What's missing is a common subfunction
ISPMSG I have implemented where I normally work.

ISPMSG is a separate REXX routine:

/* ISPMSG
REXX
   issue message to long message area in panel
*/
parse arg zedlmsg
if zedlmsg = "" then exit
address ispexec
"Vput (zedlmsg)"
"Putmsg msg(isrz000)"
/* end ISPMSG */

This is of the top of my head, but I believe it should work.
I should have thought about it, as I call ISPMSG from a number of
REXX programs.

Doc follows, see section 'So how to do it' for how to invoke ISPCMDU.

  Willy
