//*           The purpose of this package is to start with a        *
//*      TMSGRW report (a list of tapes) from the CA-1 Tape         *
//*      Management System, and produce a bunch of STK control      *
//*      cards to eject these tapes from the STK Silo, 21 tapes     *
//*      at a time.                                                 *
//*                                                                 *
//*           That's all, folks.                                    *
//*                                                                 *
//*           This system can be rewritten for the equivalent       *
//*      TLMS report to TMSGRW.                                     *
//*                                                                 *
//*           See the JCL stream called TMSEJECT in this file,      *
//*      to see how this stuff is strung together.  There are       *
//*      4 assembler programs.  This code has been                  *
//*      'modularized' to make its maintenance simpler.             *
//*                                                                 *
//*           If you have more than 5 silos, you have to            *
//*      accordingly modify program STKESTK.                        *
//*                                                                 *
