                             INTRODUCTION


    IEHMAP  IS  A  PROGRAM  THAT GIVES A FORMATTED LISTING OF A VTOC, A
 DATASET OR A CATALOG IN A FORMAT THAT IS MORE EASILY HANDLED THAN THAT
 PRODUCED  BY  THE  IEHLIST  SYSTEM  UTILITY.  IEHMAP  ALSO HAS SPECIAL
 FEATURES  THAT  HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED AS THEY WERE REQUESTED. SOME OF
 THESE FEATURES ARE THE ABILITY TO RESTORE MISSING TRACKS TO A VTOC, TO
 COMPLETELY  RE-WRITE  THE  VTOC'S  FORMAT  5  CHAIN, AND TO GIVE SPACE
 UTILIZATION REPORTS BY INDEX LEVEL.

    IEHMAP  RUNS  AS A PROBLEM PROGRAM UNDER VS AND REQUIRES NO SPECIAL
 CHANGES  TO  BE  MADE TO VS. IT CONSISTS OF TWO REENTRANT LOAD MODULES
 WHICH   MUST  HAVE  AN  AUTHORIZATION  CODE  (LINKAGE  EDITOR  SETCODE
 OPERATION) OF ONE (1).









    IEHMAP  MAY  BE  INVOKED  IN  THE  STANDARD WAY, PASSING PARAMETERS
 AND/OR ALTERNATE DDNAME'S. SEE THE UTILITIES SRL.

                        JCL TO EXECUTE IEHMAP


 JCL REQUIRED TO EXECUTE IEHMAP IS STANDARD SYSTEM UTILITY JCL:

   //STEPNAME EXEC PGM=IEHMAP<,REGION=XXXXXK>
   // <,PARM='LINES=/L=NNN,MIN=MMM,MAX=VVV,TSO'>
   //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=C<,DCB=BLKSIZE=BBBBB>

   //SYSIN DD *<,DCB=BLKSIZE=SSSSS>

      WHERE:

           NNN  (LINE  COUNT) IS ANY NUMBER FROM 10 THRU 999. THIS WILL
                BE  USED  TO  SET  THE LINE COUNT PER PAGE. THE DEFAULT
                LINE COUNT IS 56.

                NOTE:

                      IF  AN  INVALID  LINE  COUNT  IS PASSED TO IEHMAP
                           (LESS  THAN  10  OR  GREATER  THAN 999), THE
                           DEFAULT  LINE  COUNT  (56)  WILL BE USED. AN
                           ERROR MESSAGE WILL BE ISSUED; IT WILL APPEAR
                           IN THE USER'S JCL.

                      FOR  INSTALATIONS WITH UNUSUAL PAPER SIZES, ETC.,
                           THIS   MAY   BE  PERMANENTLY  OVERRIDDEN  BY
                           SUPERZAPPING   THE  CONSTANT  'LINESIZE'  IN
                           CSECT IEHMAPIN IN LOAD MODULE IEHMAPIN.

           TSO  THIS NOTIFIES IEHMAP THAT IT IS RUNNING UNDER TSO, AND,
                THEREFORE,  IT  IS  NOT  AUTHORIZED. WHEN RUNNING UNDER
                TSO,  IT CANNOT ENQ UPON THE VTOC OR CATALOG; ALSO, THE
                FIXUP AND SORT CONTROL CARDS CANNOT BE SPECIFIED.

           MMM  (MIN=  PARAMETER) IS THE MINIMUM VALUE (IN K-BYTES) FOR
                THE  VARIABLE  CONDITIONAL  GETMAIN'S  IEHMAP  DOES  TO
                OBTAIN  THE AREA FOR CONTROL BLOCKS, READING IN DSCB'S,
                ETC.  THIS  WILL  BE  ROUNDED  TO  THE  NEXT HIGHER 4-K
                BOUNDARY. THE DEFAULT IS 64 (16 4-K PAGES).

                NOTE:

                      THIS    CAN    BE   OVERRIDDEN   PERMANENTLY   BY
                           SUPERZAPPING   THE  CONSTANT  'MINVALUE'  IN
                           CSECT IEHMAPIN IN LOAD MODULE IEHMAPIN.

           VVV  (MAX=  PARAMETER) IS THE MAXIMUM VALUE (IN K-BYTES) FOR
                THE  VARIABLE  CONDITIONAL  GETMAIN'S  IEHMAP  DOES  TO
                OBTAIN  THE AREA FOR CONTROL BLOCKS, READING IN DSCB'S,
                ETC.  THIS  WILL  BE  ROUNDED  TO  THE  NEXT HIGHER J-K
                BOUNDARY.  THE  VALUE  MUST  BE AT LEAST 1 (ONE) HIGHER
                THAN  THE VALUE OF THE MIN= PARAMETER (OR ITS DEFAULT);
                IF  IT  IS  NOT,  IT  WILL BE SET TO MMM+4. THE DEFAULT
                VALUE IS 128 (32 4-K PAGES).

                NOTE:

                      THIS    CAN    BE   PERMANENTLY   OVERRIDDEN   BY
                           SUPERZAPPING   THE  CONSTANT  'MAXVALUE'  IN

           C  (SYSOUT  CLASS) IS ANY ALPHA CHARACTER FROM A TO Z OR ANY
                NUMERIC CHARACTER FROM 0 THRU 9.

                NOTE:

                      FOR PROPER OUTPUT, IEHMAP REQUIRES A 132 POSITION
                           PRINTER WITH A QN OR EQUIVALENT TRAIN/CHAIN;
                           THIS  IS REQUIRED AS IEHMAP USES THE SPECIAL
                           SYMBOLS <, >, ?, AND _.

           BBBBB  (BLKSIZE  FOR  SYSPRINT) IS ANY MULTIPLE OF 137 UP TO
                AND  INCLUDING  FULL-TRACK  BLOCKING; LRECL IS 137. THE
                DEFAULT BLOCKSIZE IS 3509. THE RECORD FORMAT IS VBA.

           SSSSS  (BLKSIZE  FOR  SYSIN) IS ANY MULTIPLE OF 80 UP TO AND
                INCLUDING FULL-TRACK BLOCKING; LRECL IS 80. THE DEFAULT
                BLOCKING FACTOR IS 1; IE, BLKSIZE=80.

   XXXXX  (REGION  SIZE)  AT  THE END OF THE OUTPUT FOR A CONTROL CARD,
        IEHMAP  PRINTS  FOUR  UNNUMBERED  MESSAGES GIVING STATISTICS ON
        CORE UTILIZATION, BROKEN DOWN BY SUBPOOL NUMBER.

           1.  THE  SECOND  LINE  GIVES  CORE ALLOCATED IN K-BYTES, THE
                THIRD LINE GIVES CORE USED IN DECIMAL BYTES.

                A.  REGION  SIZE  -  THIS  IS  THE  SIZE  OF THE REGION
                     (ADDRESS  SPACE)  IEHMAP  IS RUNNING IN (UNDER VS2
                     RELEASE  2  OR ABOVE, THIS WILL BE THE SIZE OF THE
                     PRIVATE AREA).

                B.  PROGRAM  SIZE  -  THIS IS THE TOTAL OF SUBPOOLS 252
                     (REENTRANT)  AND  251 (NON-REENTRANT); IT DOES NOT
                     INCLUDE ANY MODULES IN THE VS LINK PACK AREA.

                C.  SUPBOOL  0 - THIS IS THE SIZE OF ALL AREAS OBTAINED
                     BY  IEHMAP  AND  THE  SYSTEM FOR I/O BUFFERS, ETC.
                     THIS SHOULD BE APPROXIMATELY TWO TIMES THE SIZE OF
                     (SSSSS + BBBBB) ROUNDED TO A 4-K BOUNDARY.

                D. SUBPOOL 1 - THIS IS THE SIZE OF THE AREA OBTAINED BY
                     IEHMAP  FOR  SAVEAREAS  FOR  INTRA CSECT AND INTER
                     CSECT LINKAGES.

                E.  SUBPOOL  2  - THIS IS THE SIZE OF THE AREA OBTAINED
                     VIA  VARIABLE  CONDITIONAL  GETMAIN'S  FOR CONTROL
                     BLOCKS, READ IN AREAS FOR DSCB'S, ETC. THE MINIMUM
                     AND  MAXIMUM VALUES ARE CONTROLLED BY THE MIN= AND
                     MAX=  PARAMETERS.  ONCE OBTAINED, THIS AREA IS NOT
                     FREED UNTIL ALL CONTROL CARDS HAVE BEEN PROCESSED;
                     IE,  THE  SIZE  MAY  GO UP WITH SUBSEQUENT CONTROL
                     CARDS,  BUT  IT WILL NEVER GO DOWN. THEREFORE, THE
                     AMOUNT   USED   IN   SUBPOOL   2  MAY  BE  GREATLY
                     DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE SIZE OF SUBPOOL 2.

                F.  SUBPOOL  3  - THIS IS THE SIZE OF IEHMAP'S WORKAREA
                     (CONTAINING  SCRATCH  AREAS, CHAIN HEADERS, DCB'S,
                     ETC.)

                G. MIN= AND MAX= - THESE ARE THE VALUES OF THE MIN= AND
                     MAX=  VARIABLES  FOR  OBTAINING SUBPOOL 2 CORE. IF
                     NOT OVERRIDDEN VIA THE PARM FIELD, THE WILL BE SET
                     AT MIN=64K AND MAX=128K.

                H.  REGION USED - THIS IS THE TOTAL OF ALL USED CORE IN
                     THE ABOVE SUBPOOLS.

 SECTION I-C: CORE REQUIREMENTS

           2.  THE  FOURTH  LINE  GIVES THE APPROXIMATE, MINIMUM REGION
                REQUIRED  FOR  THE CURRENT CONTROL CARD RUNNING AGAINST
                THE CURRENT VOLUME. THIS IS A TOTAL OF THE FOLLOWING:

                A. SUBPOOL 0 ALLOCATED
                B. SUBPOOL 1 ALLOCATED
                C. SUBPOOL 2 USED ROUNDED TO THE MIN= VALUE
                D. SUBPOOL 3 ALLOCATED
                E. PROGRAM SIZE

           3.  SINCE  IEHMAP  DOES VARIABLE CONDITIONAL GETMAIN'S, WHEN
                RUNNING  UNDER  VS2  RELEASE  2 OR ABOVE, A REGION SIZE
                MUST  BE  SUPPLIED  ON  THE JOB OR EXEC JCL CARD OR THE
                SIZE  PARAMETER  WHEN  LOGGING ONTO TSO, IF THE DEFAULT
                REGION  SIZE  IS  NOT EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN THE SIZE
                GIVEN IN THE MINIMUM REGION REQUIRED MESSAGE.

           4.  FOR  VOLUMES  WITH  A  LARGE NUMBER OF DATASETS, FOR TTR
                CONTROL  CARD  OUTPUT,  FOR VERIFY CONTROL CARD OUTPUT,
                AND  FOR SPACE, USERID OR DEPT CONTROL CARD OUTPUT, THE
                REGION  SIZE  MAY  HAVE  TO BE INCREASED TO AS LARGE AS
                1000K OR MORE.

                         DDCARD'S FOR IEHMAP


 SYSPRINT  THIS  IS  THE  PRIMARY  OUTPUT  FOR  IEHMAP; IT CONTAINS A A
      LISTING  OF  THE  CONTROL CARDS, ANY ERROR MESSAGES THAT MAY HAVE
      BEEN GENERATED, AND THE OUTPUT REQUESTED BY THE CONTROL CARDS.

 SYSPRINT  HAS  A  RECORD  FORMAT  OF VARIABLE BLOCKED WITH ASA CONTROL
      CHARACTERS  (VBA),  A LOGICAL RECORD LENGTH OF 137, AND A DEFAULT
      BLOCKSIZE  OF  3509.  THE  BLOCKSIZE  MAY  BE  OVERRIDDEN VIA THE
      DDCARD.

      NOTE:

            THIS  IS A CHANGE FORM IEHMAP VERSIONS I AND II. VERSIONS I
                 AND  II  HAD A RECORD FORMAT OF FIXED BLOCKED WITH ASA
                 CONTROL  CHARACTERS  (FBA) AND A LOGICAL RECORD LENGTH
                 OF  133.  THIS  WAS CHANGED IN VERSION III TO CONSERVE
                 SPACE IN THE SYSPRINT FILE.

 SYSIN  THIS  IS  THE  CONTROL  CARD  INPUT  TO IEHMAP. IT CONTAINS THE
      CONTROL  CARDS  THE USER HAS PRODUCED TO TELL IEHMAP WHAT TYPE OF
      OUTPUT HE WANTS.

 SYSIN HAS A RECORD FORMAT OF FIXED BLOCKED, A LOGICAL RECORD LENGTH OF
      80,  AND  A  DEFAULT  BLOCKSIZE  OF  80.  THE  BLOCKSIZE  MAY  BE
      OVERRIDDEN VIA THE DDCARD.

 DDNAME1  THRU DDNAMEN THESE DDCARD'S (WHICH CAN HAVE ANY DDNAME EXCEPT
      THE   FOLLOWING  -  SYSIN,  SYSPRINT,  JOBLIB,  STEPLIB,  JOBCAT,
      STEPCAT,  SYSABEND,  SYSUDUMP,  AND PGM=*.DD) SUPPLY A VOLUME FOR
      IEHMAP  TO WORK WITH. IF A VTOC LISTING IS REQUESTED, IEHMAP WILL
      INTERNALLY  CHANGE  THE  JFCB TO POINT TO THE VOLUME'S VTOC, IF A
      CATALOG LISTING, TO THE CATALOG, IF A DATASET, TO THE DATASET.

                            CONTROL CARDS


 CONTROL CARDS FOR IEHMAP ARE FREE FORM WITH THE FOLLOWING FORMAT:

           <NAME> OPERATION OPERAND1<,OPERAND2><,OPT=(OPTIONS)>

         NAME  IS  OPTIONAL,  BUT  IF  OMITTED,  AT  LEAST ONE BLANK IS
              REQUIRED.  THE  LENGTH OF THE NAME FIELD NEED NOT BE LESS
              THAN OR EQUAL EIGHT CHARACTERS AS IT IS IGNORED.

         OPERAND1 AND/OR OPERAND2 CAN BE ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:

                DSNAME
                VOL=VOLID
                CNAME=ALT-CATALOG-NAME
                QUAL=QUALIFIER-NAME

           DSNAME  THIS  IS  THE  FULLY QUALIFIED NAME OF A DATASET FOR
                IEHMAP  TO  WORK  WITH OR, IF THE OPERATION IS CATLG OR
                USERID,  IT MAY BE AN INDEX LEVEL. IF IT IS A MEMBER OF
                A  GDG,  IT  CAN  BE SUPPLIED IN THE MANNER OF JCL; IE,
                GDG(-1), GDG(0), ETC.

           VOL=  THIS  IS THE VOLUME (VOLID) FOR IEHMAP TO WORK WITH OR
                THE VOLUME ON WHICH DSNAME OR THE CATALOG RESIDES.

           CNAME= THIS IS THE DSNAME TO BE USED ON A CATLG LISTING WHEN
                THE  CATALOG'S  NAME IS NOT SYSCTLG. THIS WOULD BE USED
                WHEN A BACKUP COPY OF THE CATALOG IS BEING KEPT AND YOU
                WISH TO LIST IT.

           QUAL=  THIS  GIVES  THE NUMBER OF DIGITS THAT SHOULD BE USED
                FOR  A  DEPT  OPERATION.  THE QUALIFIER-NAME MAY BE ANY
                CHARACTERS  WHICH  ADD  UP  TO  THE LENGTH DESIRED; EG,
                QUAL=DDD WOULD GIVE A 3 DIGIT LENGTH.

           OPT=  FOR CERTAIN OF THE IEHMAP OPERATIONS, OTHER OPERATIONS
                MAY  BE  COMPATIBLE AND CAN BE SPECIFIED AS THE OPTIONS
                OF  THE OPT= FIELD. FOR CERTAIN OPERATIONS (SEE BELOW),
                OPT= MUST BE SPECIFIED.

                NOTES:

                      IF  VOLID  IS  NOT GIVEN AND DSNAME IS, DSNAME IS
                           ASSUMED  TO BE CATALOGED AND A SEARCH OF THE
                           CATALOG  WILL  BE  MADE,  USING THE "SYSRES"
                           CATALOG AS THE START OF THE CATALOG SEARCH.

                      IF  VOLID  IS GIVEN WITH DSNAME, THAT VOLUME WILL
                           BE  USED  AS  THE  LOCATION  OF  DSNAME,  NO
                           CATALOG SEARCH WILL BE MADE.

                      IF  DSNAME  IS  GIVEN  IN  THE  JCL FORM OF A GDG
                           MEMBER,  IT MUST BE CATALOGED; THEREFORE, IF
                           VOLID IS GIVEN, IT WILL BE IGNORED.

                      IF  CNAME= IS GIVEN, VOL= MUST ALSO BE SPECIFIED,
                           UNLESS   THE  ALTERNATE  CATALOG  IS  ITSELF
                           CATALOGED IN THE SYSTEM CATALOG.

                      IF  MULTIPLE  OPTIONS ARE SPECIFIED, THEY MUST BE
                           ENCLOSED  IN  PARENTHESES  AND  SEPARATED BY
                           COMMAS; IF ONLY ONE OPTION IS SPECIFIED, THE
                           PARENTHESES MAY BE OMITTED.

                      IF  THE  OPERATION  IS  DEPT  OR  SPACE, THE VOL=
                           PARAMETER MAY HAVE MULTIPLE VOLID'S ENCLOSED
                           IN PARENTHESES; EG, VOL=(D06DB0,D89RES).

                      THE  QUAL=  OPERAND  MAY BE SPECIFIED ONLY IF THE
                           OPERATION IS DEPT; IN ALL OTHER CASES, IT IS
                           IGNORED.

      CHAINS BUT THE FORMAT 1 CHAIN.

 CCHHR CONTROL CARD

   1. <NAME> CCHHR VOL=VOLID

      THIS  WILL  GIVE THE SAME INFORMATION AS A DUMP VOL=VOLID CONTROL
      CARD  WOULD  GIVE;  HOWEVER,  THE  DSCB'S WILL BE DUMPED IN CCHHR
      ORDER;  THAT IS, THEY WILL BE DUMPED IN THE ORDER THEY ARE IN THE
      VTOC,  NOT  ALPHABETICALLY  BY  DATASET  NAME.  ALSO, THE VARIOUS
      CHAINS OF DSCB'S (THE FORMAT 1 CHAIN, THE FORMAT 5 CHAIN, AND THE
      FORMAT  6  CHAIN)  WILL  NOT  BE  DUMPED  IN CHAIN ORDER. THIS IS
      SIMILAR TO THE DUMP OPTION OF IEHLIST.

   2. <NAME> CCHHR DSNAME

      THIS  WILL GIVE THE SAME INFORMATION AS A CCHHR VOL=VOLID CONTROL
      CARD  WOULD  FOR  THE VOLUME ON WHICH DSNAME RESIDES; IE, IT WILL
      NOT  DUMP  ONLY THE DSCB'S ASSOCIATED WITH DSNAME - THIS WOULD BE
      ACCOMPLISHED BY USING THE DUMP DSNAME CONTROL CARD.

 DSNAME CONTROL CARD

   1. <NAME> DSNAME DSNAME

      THIS  WILL  GIVE  THE SAME INFORMATION AS A NAME CONTROL CARD FOR

      NOTE:

           THE  CATALOG  PROCESSING ROUTINES OF IEHMAP CANNOT PROCESS A
           VSAM CATALOG.

   1. <NAME> CATLG VOL=VOLID

      THIS WILL GIVE:

           A. A SUMMARY OF THE CATALOG FOR VOLID GIVING:

                THE NUMBER OF BLOCKS IN THE CATALOG
                THE FIRST AVAILABLE TTR IN THE CATALOG
                THE FIRST EXTENT OF THE CATALOG
                THE NUMBER OF EXTENTS THE CATALOG OCCUPIES
                THE NUMBER OF CATALOG BLOCKS PER TRACK

           B. AN ALPHABETICAL LISTING OF ALL CATALOG ENTRIES GIVING:

                THE CATALOG ENTRY
                THE TYPE OF ENTRY
                THE NUMBER OF VOLUMES A DATASET IS CATALOGED TO

                VOLUME TYPE IN HEX
                VOLUME DESCRIPTION
                VOLUME SEQUENCE NUMBER

                NOTE:

                      A  VOLUME DESCRIPTION OF 'UNKNOWN' SAYS THAT THAT
                      PARTICULAR  TYPE  OF  DEVICE  IS  NOT IN IEHMAP'S
                      TABLE  OF  VOLUME  TYPES.  THIS USUALLY OCCURS ON
                      DATASETS  THAT  ARE  CATALOGED VIA IEHPROGM USING
                      VOL=SYSDA=VOLID.   THIS   CAN   BE  CORRECTED  BY
                      SUPERZAPPING  THE  CATDEV  CSECT  IN  LOAD MODULE
                      IEHMAP.

                THE NUMBER OF GDG INDICES FOUND
                THE NUMBER OF CVOL ENTRIES FOUND
                THE NUMBER OF UNUSED INDICES FOUND
                THE NUMBER OF DATASETS CATALOGED
                THE NUMBER OF ALIAS ENTRIES FOUND
                THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF INDICES IN A NAME

           E. A USEAGE SUMMARY OF THE CATALOG BLOCKS

                THE NUMBER OF BLOCKS IN THE CATALOG
                THE NUMBER OF UNUSED BLOCKS IN THE CATALOG

           F. A SUMMARY OF I/O OPERATIONS

                THE NUMBER OF ENTRIES TO THE READ ROUTINE
                THE NUMBER OF CATALOG BLOCKS FOUND IN CORE

                THESE  TWO  STATISTICS  GIVE  SOME  INDICATION  OF  THE
                FRAGMENTATION  OF  THE  CATALOG  INDICES. THE NUMBER OF
                ENTRIES  TO  THE  READ ROUTINE IS THE NUMBER OF TIMES A
                CHAIN  OF  BLOCKS  WAS BEING FOLLOWED (EITHER FOWARD OR
                BACKWARDS).  THE NUMBER OF CATALOG BLOCKS FOUND IN CORE
                IS  THE NUMBER OF TIMES A PREVIOUSLY READ CATALOG BLOCK
                WAS   REQUESTED  (FOR  EFFICIENCY  AND  TO  LESSEN  I/O
                OPERATIONS,  AS IEHMAP GOES FOWARD DOWN AN INDEX CHAIN,
                IT KEEPS THE PREVIOUSLY READ BLOCKS IN CORE).

   2. <NAME> CATLG

      THIS WILL BE INTERPRETED AS REQUESTING THE CATALOG OF THE CURRENT
      "SYSRES" DEVICE.

           NOTE:

                 A DDCARD FOR "SYSRES" IS REQUIRED.

   3. <NAME> CATLG DSNAME<,VOL=VOLID>

      THIS  WILL START THE CATALOG LISTING AT DSNAME. THE DSNAME MAY BE
      FULLY  QUALIFIED OR MAY BE AN INDEX LEVEL; IT MAY BE A GDG MEMBER
      AND  MAY  BE GIVEN IN THE MANNER OF JCL (IE, OF THE FORM GDG(-1),
      ETC.)

      THIS INDICATES TO IEHMAP THAT DSNAME IS AN ALTERNATE CATALOG (IE,
      IT DOES NOT HAVE A DSNAME OF SYSCTLG), AND TELLS IEHMAP TO GIVE A
      CATLG LISTING OF IT.

      ALL  OPTIONS  VALID FOR CATLG CONTROL CARDS CAN BE SPECIFIED WITH
      CNAME=.

   5. <NAME> CATLG VOL=VOLID,OPT=NOPRINT

      THIS  GIVES THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE CATALOG ON VOLID THAT CATLG

 SPACE CONTROL CARD

   1. <NAME> SPACE VOL=VOLID

      THIS  REQUESTS THAT A LISTING OF ALL DATASETS AVAILABLE TO IEHMAP
      (VIA  DDCARDS  POINTING  TO  VOLUMES)  BE  GIVEN  BY  FIRST LEVEL
      QUALIFIER,  THAT A CHECK BE MADE FOR THEIR BEING CATALOGED IN THE
      CATALOG  ON  VOLID,  AND  A SPACE ACCOUNTING BE MADE OF THE TRACK
      ALLOCATION AND USEAGE.

      DATASETS  WHICH ARE CATALOGED BUT NOT AVAILABLE TO IEHMAP WILL BE
      FLAGGED WITH THE INDICATION:

      NOT ON VOLUME OR VOLUME NOT MOUNTED

   2. <NAME> SPACE VOL=(VOLID,VOLID,...)

      THIS  TELLS  IEHMAP  THAT A SPACE REPORT SHOULD BE GIVEN AND THAT
      MULTIPLE  CATALOGS  ARE  TO  BE  USED. THE CATALOGS ARE ON VOLID,

 USERID CONTROL CARD

   1. <NAME> USERID INDEX,VOL=VOLID

      THIS  REQUESTS  THAT A SPACE CONTROL CARD OUTPUT BE GIVEN FOR THE
      INDEX LEVEL GIVEN ON THE CONTROL CARD. A SPACE ACCOUNTING FOR ALL
      DATASETS  AVAILABLE  TO IEHMAP (VIA DDCARD'S) FOR THE INDEX LEVEL
      SPECIFIED  WILL  BE GIVEN. THE VOLID GIVEN IN THE VOL= OPERAND IS
      THE LOCATION OF THE CATALOG FOR THE INDEX GIVEN.

 DEPT CONTROL CARD

   1. <NAME> DEPT QUAL=QUALIFIER,VOL=VOLID

      THIS  REQUESTS THAT A SPACE CONTROL CARD OUTPUT BE GIVEN, BUT THE
      OUTPUT  SHOULD  BE  SEGMENTED  BY  DEPARTMENTS.  THE  SIZE OF THE
      DEPARTMENTAL  ID  IS  GIVEN  BY  THE  NUMBER OF CHARACTERS IN THE
      QUALIFIER;  IE,  THE  COUNT OF CHARACTERS DETERMINES WHERE IEHMAP
      SHOULD  START  ACCOUNTING  FOR  A  NEW  DEPARTMENT.  EG, QUAL=XXX
      SPECIFIES  THAT  THE  DEPARTMENTAL  IDENTIFIERS  ARE IN THE FIRST
      THREE CHARACTERS OF ALL INDICES.

   2. <NAME> DEPT QUAL=QUALIFIER,VOL=(VOLID,VOLID,...)

      THIS  REQUESTS  THAT  THE  DEPT  CONTROL CARD OUTPUT BE GIVEN FOR
      MULTIPLE CATALOGS. THE CATALOGS ARE ON VOLID, VOLID, ...

 FIXUP CONTROL CARD

   1. <NAME> FIXUP VOL=VOLID

         THIS TELLS IEHMAP TO MAKE AN ATTEMPT TO RECOVER MISSING TRACKS
      ON  VOLID.  THIS  IS  DONE  BY ADDING MISSING EXTENTS TO THE LAST
      FORMAT 5 IN THE FORMAT 5 CHAIN, AND IN ADDITION, ONE EXTRA FORMAT
      5  WILL  BE  BUILD  FROM A FORMAT 0. BY THIS MEANS, FROM 26 TO 51
      MISSING EXTENTS MAY BE RECOVERED.

         THE  OUTPUT  OF FIXUP IS THE SAME AS TWO TRACKS CONTROL CARDS.
      THE  FIRST  OUTPUT  SHOWS THE MISSING TRACKS THAT WERE FOUND, AND
      THE  ACTION  THAT  IEHMAP  TOOK  (REPLACED  OR NOT REPLACED). THE
      SECOND IS A NORMAL TRACKS OUTPUT SHOWING WHAT THE VTOC LOOKS LIKE
      AFTER THE FIXUP OPERATION.

 SORT CONTROL CARD

   1. <NAME> SORT VOL=VOLID

         THIS  REQUESTS  IEHMAP  TO MAKE A MORE ENCOMPASSING ATTEMPT TO
      RECOVER  MISSING  TRACKS THAN A FIXUP WILL DO. IEHMAP ATTEMPTS TO
      ARRANGE  THE MISSING TRACKS IN CCHHR ORDER IN THE FORMAT 5 CHAIN,
      THEN THE FORMAT 5 CHAIN IS REWRITTEN.

         THE  OUTPUT  OF  A  SORT  OPERATION  IS  THE  SAME AS A FIXUP;
      HOWEVER, ALL FREE SPACE WILL BE LISTED AS MISSING, AND THE ACTION
      IEHMAP TOOK WILL BE SHOWN.

         SORT SHOULD BE USED IF THE SECOND OUTPUT OF A FIXUP SHOWS THAT
      IEHMAP HAS CREATED MULTIPLE CONTIGUOUS EXTENTS, AND/OR THE VOLUME
      HAS  MORE  THAN  THREE  FORMATS  5.  BY  MULTIPLE CONTIGUOUS FREE
      EXTENTS  IS  MEANT  TWO  OR  MORE  CONTIGUOUS  EXTENTS  MARKED AS
      'AVAILABLE' ON THE SECOND OUTPUT OF FIXUP.

 SEND CONTROL CARD

   1. <NAME> SEND MESSAGE-TO-BE-SENT-TO-SYSTEM-OPERATOR

         THIS ALLOWS THE USER OF IEHMAP TO SEND A MESSAGE TO THE SYSTEM
      OPERATOR.  THIS COULD BE USED TO SUPPLY THE PASSWORD FOR A 'READ'
      PROTECTED DATASET DURING A PDS OPERATION, ETC.

         THE MESSAGE CANNOT BE CONTINUED BEYOND COLUMN 71; FOR MESSAGES
      LONGER  THAN THE ALLOWABLE LENGTH, MULTIPLE SEND CARDS WOULD HAVE
      TO BE USED.

         THERE  IS  NO LIMIT TO THE NUMBER OF SEND CARDS THAT CAN BE IN
      THE  IEHMAP  INPUT STREAM NOR THEIR PLACEMENT AS THEY ARE TREATED
      AS COMMENT CARDS (SEE BELOW).

 COMMENT CARDS

         COMMENTS  MAY BE INCLUDED IN THE IEHMAP INPUT STREAM BY HAVING
      AN  ASTERISK  (*)  IN  COLUMN  1.  THE COMMENT MAY BE EXTENDED TO
      COLUMN 80 AS NO CHECK OF THE CARD IS MADE.

         THERE  IS  NO LIMIT AS TO THE NUMBER OF COMMENT CARDS THAT MAY
      BE INCLUDED, NOR ON THEIR POSITIONING.

 PASS OPTION

   1. <NAME> OPERATION OPERAND1<,OPERAND2>,OPT=PASS

         THE  PASS  OPTION MAY BE SPECIFIED FOR PDS, TTR, DIR OR ATTRIB
      CONTROL  CARDS.  IF A DATASET IS PARTITIONED BUT IS PROTECTED FOR
      'READ'  (IE, PWREAD), IEHMAP WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO GIVE A PDS, TTR,
      DIR,  OR  ATTRIB  LISTING  FOR  THIS  DATASET UNLESS OPT=PASS WAS
      SPECIFIED.  THIS IS DONE TO MINIMIZE OPERATOR INTERVENTION DURING
      AN  IEHMAP  RUN.  IF A DATASET IS PROTECTED ONLY FOR 'WRITE' (IE,
      PWWRITE),  IEHMAP WILL OPEN IT AND GIVE THE DIRECTORY INFORMATION
      REQUESTED.

 TTR OPTION

   1. <NAME> ATTRIB OPERAND1,OPT=TTR

         THE  TTR  OPTION,  WHEN  SPECIFIED ON THE ATTRIB CONTROL CARD,
      WILL  GIVE  THE  SAME OUTPUT AS THE ATTRIB CONTROL CARD; HOWEVER,
      THE MEMBER NAMES WILL BE SORTED IN TTR ORDER NOT ALPHABETICAL.

 OTHER OPTIONS

   1. <NAME> OPERATION OPERAND1<,OPERAND2>,OPT=DUMP

         THE  DUMP  OPTION  MAY BE SPECIFIED ON MOST CONTROL CARDS. THE
      CONTROL  CARDS  ON  WHICH  IT  IS  MOST USEFUL ARE PDS, TTR, DIR,
      ATTRIB, AND CATLG.

         ON  THE  PO DATASET OPERATIONS, THE DSCB'S ASSOCIATED WITH THE
      DATASET WILL BE DUMPED, IN HEX, AFTER THE REQUESTED OUTPUT.

         ON  THE CATLG OPERATION, EACH CATALOG BLOCK WILL BE DUMPED, IN
      HEX,  AS  IT  IS READ; IE, THE CATALOG ENTRY FOLLOWING THE DUMPED
      CATALOG  BLOCK  MAY  NOT  BELONG  TO THAT BLOCK BUT MAY HAVE BEEN
      BUILT  FROM  UP  TO  22  PREVIOUS  BLOCKS  (THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF
      INDICES IN A CATALOGED DATASET NAME).

         THE  EQUIVALENT OF OPT=DUMP FOR A MAP CONTROL CARD IS THE DUMP
      CONTROL  CARD,  BUT  OPT=DUMP  MAY  BE SPECIFIED ON A MAP CONTROL
      CARD.

   2. <NAME> OPERATION OPERAND1<,OPERAND2>,OPT=AQUEUE

         THIS  SAYS  THAT  THE  OPEN, CLOSE, AND EOV ROUTINES HAVE BEEN
      MODIFIED TO SET A REFERENCE AND CHANGE DATE IN THE FORMAT 1 DSCB.
      THIS  REQUESTS  THAT  THE CREATION, REFERENCE AND CHANGE DATES BE
      FORMATTED IN PLACE OF THE VOLUME CREATED ON, THE DATASET SEQUENCE
      NUMBER, AND THE EXPIRATION DATE.

   3. <NAME > OPERATION OPERAND1<,OPERAND2>,OPT=NOPRINT

         THE NOPRINT OPTION MAY BE SPECIFIED ON MOST CONTROL CARDS. THE
      CONTROL CARDS ON WHICH IT IS MOST USEFUL ARE MAP AND CATLG.

         WHEN  NOPRINT  IS  SPECIFIED,  NO  DATASET INFORMATION WILL BE
      GIVEN; ONLY THE SUMMARIES WILL BE OUTPUTTED. THEREFORE, IT IS NOT
      ADVISABLE TO US OPT=NOPRINT ON PDS, ATTRIB, ETC. CONTROL CARDS.
