))PDU0001I - Function completed (CC=nnnn)

    This signals completion of the PDS Update Utility function.  The
    completion codes (nnnn) are:

    0000 - Normal completion
    0012 - One of the conditions listed below was encountered:

      Panvalet directory search (GTEUA10) -
       1.  Directory/comment for current entry is returned, but next
           name could not be computed because the current name is too
           high (e.g. current: NAME99).
       2.  Failure to open or close the Panvalet library.  Any
           returned information is unreliable.

       1.  Input date out of range (0-365/366).

      Invoke program PAN#1 for update function (GTEUA60) -
       1.  Error returned from PAN#1.
       2.  Input name was shorter than 3 characters.

      Update PDS member and/or directory entry (GTEUA70) -
       1.  RECFM of seq file not F, FB, FA, or FBA
       2.  LRECL of seq file not 80
       3.  BLKSIZE of seq file less than 80
       4.  Not enough storage for I/O operation, or FREEMAIN for the
           storage was unsuccessful.
       5.  STOW operation failed because the directory was out of
           space.
       6.  DDNAME for PDS not allocated.
       7.  Failure to enqueue or dequeue the dataset name.
       8.  DELETE member name is not in PDS.
       9.  ALIAS member already exists in PDS.

      Create ISPF statistics from Panvalet comment (GTEUA80) -
       1.  The update was not made because the member did not already
           exist in the PDS.

      Display PDS and Panvalet statistics (GTEUA10) -
       1.  The member was not found in the PDS.
       2.  A member with a matching name pattern was not found in the
           Panvalet library.

))PDU0002I - Type in subcommand:

    This is a prompt to enter the next PUP subcommand.

=UPDATE=CHANGE=ADD
)F FUNCTION -
    The UPDATE subcommand executes the UPDATE function of the PDS
    Update utility.  It copies data from an input sequential dataset,
    or from a member of an input PDS, into the output PDS and also
    creates a backup copy in the Panvalet library.  UPDATE creates
    ISPF-format statistics in both the PDS and Panvalet library.
    UPDATE also is used for ADDs and CHANGEs.

    Note - When a PDS member which has an alias is UPDATEd or
           RESTOREd, the old alias will still be associated with
           the old version of the member.  The old version of the
           alias should be DELETEd with the DELETE subcommand,
           then reassigned with the ALIAS subcommand.

)X SYNTAX -
        UPDATE  pds-dsname(pds-member)  WITH(input-dsn)
                                        FROM(input-dsn)
                                       USING(input-dsn)

    ALIASES  - ADD, CHANGE
    DEFAULTS - none
    REQUIRED - pds-dsname(pds-member), input-dsn

)O OPERANDS -
  pds-dsname(pds-member)
    A 1-44 character name of the PDS to be updated, and the 1-8
    character member name.

))WITH(input-dsn)
    The name of the input datset which contains the updated version
    of the member.  Input-dsn may be a sequential dataset or a member
    of a partitioned dataset.  Input-dsn must have 80-byte, fixed-
    length logical records.

))FROM
    Synonym for the WITH operand.

))USING
    Synonym for the WITH operand.

=BACKUP
)F FUNCTION -
    The BACKUP subcommand executes the BACKUP function of the PDS
    Update utility.  It makes a new Panvalet backup copy of the PDS
    member.

)X SYNTAX -
        BACKUP  pds-dsname(pds-member)

    ALIASES  - none
    DEFAULTS - none
    REQUIRED - pds-dsname(pds-member)

)O OPERANDS -
  pds-dsname(pds-member)
    A 1-44 character name of the PDS, and the 1-8 character name
    of the member to be backed up.

=RESTORE
)F FUNCTION -
    The RESTORE subcommand executes the RESTORE function of the PDS
    Update utility.  It is used to copy a back-level version of the
    member from the Panvalet library to the PDS.

    Note - When a PDS member which has an alias is UPDATEd or
           RESTOREd, the old alias will still be associated with
           the old version of the member.  The old version of the
           alias should be DELETEd with the DELETE subcommand,
           then reassigned with the ALIAS subcommand.

)X SYNTAX -
        RESTORE  pds-dsname(pds-member)  WITH  VERSION(pan-suffix)
                                         FROM
                                        USING

    ALIASES  - none
    DEFAULTS - none
    REQUIRED - pds-dsname(pds-member), pan-suffix

)O OPERANDS -
  pds-dsname(pds-member)
    A 1-44 character name of the PDS to be updated, and the 1-8
    character member name.

))WITH
    This operand is not required.  It is provided in order to make the
    subcommand more readable.

))FROM
    Synonym for the WITH operand.

))USING
    Synonym for the WITH operand.

))VERSION(pan-suffix)
    The two-digit suffix, 00-99, of the name of the Panvalet member
    from which the restore will take place.

=DELETE
)F FUNCTION -
    The DELETE subcommand executes the DELETE function of the
    PDS Update utility.  It DELETEs the member from the PDS, but
    does not delete backup copies from the Panvalet library.

    Note - When a PDS member which has an alias is UPDATEd or
           RESTOREd, the old alias will still be associated with
           the old version of the member.  The old version of the
           alias should be DELETEd with the DELETE subcommand,
           then reassigned with the ALIAS subcommand.

           When a PDS member which has an alias is DELETEd, the
           old alias will still be associated with the old
           version of the member.  The old version of the alias
           also should be DELETEd with the DELETE subcommand.

)X SYNTAX -
        DELETE  pds-dsname(pds-member)

    ALIASES  - none
    DEFAULTS - none
    REQUIRED - pds-dsname(pds-member)

)O OPERANDS -
  pds-dsname(pds-member)
    A 1-44 character name of the PDS to be updated, and the 1-8
    character member name.

=ALIAS
)F FUNCTION -
    The ALIAS subcommand executes the ALIAS function of the PDS
    Update utility.  It assigns an additional, alternate name
    (alias) to a member of a PDS.  ALIAS has no effect on the
    backup copies in the Panvalet library.

    Note - When a PDS member which has an alias is UPDATEd or
           RESTOREd, the old alias will still be associated with
           the old version of the member.  The old version of the
           alias should be DELETEd with the DELETE subcommand,
           then reassigned with the ALIAS subcommand.

           When a PDS member which has an alias is DELETEd, the
           old alias will still be associated with the old
           version of the member.  The old version of the alias
           also should be DELETEd with the DELETE subcommand.

)X SYNTAX -
        ALIAS  pds-dsname(pds-member)  alias-name

    A 1-44 character name of the PDS to be updated, and the 1-8
    character member name.

  alias-name
