                         The PUP Command

PURPOSE
-------
    This software provides an easy facility for backing up and
    restoring individual members of a partitioned dataset, using
    Panvalet to maintain up to 99 backup versions of each member.


DESCRIPTION
-----------
    The GTEU application is invoked by PUP.  The GTEU application is
    the software which uses Panvalet to keep backup copies of members
    of a PDS.  As members are added, or replaced, in a PDS such as a
    CLIST library, backup copies are entered in a Panvalet library.
    Up to 99 back copies of each member can be maintained in the
    Panvalet library.  ISPF statistics are maintained in both the PDS
    and the Panvalet library.  At any time, the PDS member can be
    RESTOREd from any back level.  The GTEU programs also can be run
    in batch jobs with JCL.

    The PUP command is a TSO command processor which is used for
    online access to the GTEU application programs.  PUP can be run
    from READY, from ISPF, or from a CLIST or ISPF Dialog.

    The PUP command has the following subcommands:

     HELP      - Execute the HELP facility.
     STATS     - Display info about the Panvalet and PDS members.
      STATUS   - Same as STATS.
     UPDATE    - Update the PDS member and make a backup Panvalet copy.
      ADD      - Same as UPDATE.
      CHANGE   - Same as UPDATE.
     ALIAS     - Create an alias entry for a member of a PDS.
     DELETE    - Delete a PDS member, or a PDS alias entry.
     BACKUP    - Make a backup Panvalet member from a PDS member.
     RESTORE   - Copy a member from the Panvalet library into the PDS.
     END       - Terminate the PUP command.
     TSTATS    - Display info with the PANINDEX and PDS commands.
      TSTATUS  - Same as TSTATS.
     ABEND0C1  - Cause a S0C1 ABEND for testing.


REQUIREMENTS
------------
    Only the Panvalet/OS product is required.  The PAN/TSO interface
    is not required (the 'PAN' command) nor is the PAN/ISPF interface.
    PanExec is not required.  ISPF is not required.  TSO/E is not
    required.

    The code was originally written and tested on an MVS/SP1.3.3
    system, using Panvalet/OS Release 11.0d.  This release of
    Panvalet/OS was the current release, and was supported under
    MVS/370 and MVS/XA.

    There is an optional interface to the PDS command and the PANINDEX
    command.


INSTALLATION
------------
    The PUP command, and the GTEU application it invokes, easily can
    be installed in one day.  Installation instructions are provided
    for an SMP/E install, and a non-SMP/E install.

    All source code is provided.  All code is completely reenterable,
    reusable and refreshable, so it can be placed into any private or
    system library.
