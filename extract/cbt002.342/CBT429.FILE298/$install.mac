                            INSTALLATION

          This installation procedure looks awfully long, but that's
          because I broke it down into a zillion little steps, and I
          tried to explain WHY the steps were being performed, and
          WHAT you should see after each step executes.

          In spite of the length, you should be able to do this
          install easily within one normal (?) work day, provided you
          know how to get reasonable batch turnaround.

          You can install this software with SMP/E, or without it.  I
          personally have a strong preference for using SMP/E, so I
          naturally recommend that you use SMP/E for this install.

 STEP  1 - MEMBER $nnDEL - DELETE the prior release of GTEU (R1.01)

    ********************************************************************
    *  (  )  1.  If you will be doing an install without SMP/E, skip   *
    *            to STEP 1A.                                           *
    ********************************************************************

       (  )  2.  If you have the prior release (R1.01) installed, this
                 job will delete it.  If you do not have the prior
                 release installed, skip this step.  Be careful to set
                 the VOL=SER operand in the JCL if you are not going
                 to be working on the cataloged DLIBs and TLIBs.


 STEP  2 - MEMBER $nnALLOC - Allocate and catalog datasets.

       (  )  1.  Rename this dataset you are reading to SYS1.GTEUSRC.

       (  )  2.  If you had already installed the prior release, you
                 can reuse the existing target library (GTEULIB) and
                 the distribution library (AGTEULIB).  You should
                 compress them, and check to see that all old members
                 were deleted by the previous step of this install.
                 A new transient linklib (GTEULK) should be created,
                 to avoid mixing old and new software.  The deinstall
                 of the prior release would not have affected the
                 transient link library or the source library.

       (  )  3.  Set the actual volume name in the DD1 and DD2
                 statements.  If you want space allocated on volumes
                 other than IPL volumes, follow the instructions in
                 the JCL comments.  Supply JOB card information, then
                 run the job.


 STEP  3 - MEMBER $nnASM - Assemble GTEU modules.

       (  )  1.  Module GTEUPUP in this PDS is the source module for
                 the TSO command processor.  One of its subcommands,
                 TSTATS, invokes the TSO commands PANINDEX and PDS.
                 If you do not have both the PANINDEX and PDS
                 commands, go into EDIT on the GTEUPUP source module
                 and comment out the two lines relating to the TSTATS
                 and TSTATUS subcommands at label SUTBL.  This is the
                 subcommand table of the TSO command processor.

                 If you delete TSTATS, also go into the HELP member
                 GTEUPUPH and delete the information about TSTATS and
                 TSTATUS after labels ')S SUBCOMMANDS' and
                 '=TSTATS=TSTATUS'

       (  )  2.  Module GTEUPUP dynamically allocates four temporary
                 datasets using the UNIT name of SYSTSO.  At labels
                 @WK and AWK in source module GTEUPUP, change the UNIT
                 name from SYSTSO to a valid name for your
                 installation.  If you need to, you can add a VLSER=
                 (not VOLSER) parameter to select a particular volume,
                 and you can optionally delete the UNIT parameter.
                 Just be sure the macros at @WK and AWK receive the
                 same changes.  If you need complete information on
                 the dynamic allocation macros, see macro GTEDADAT in
                 this dataset.

       (  )  3.  Module GTEUA10 dynamically loads the Panvalet Access
                 Method (PAM) routines.  It does this because the PAM
                 routines are not reenterable.  Get a map of the PAM
                 module with a utility like the Linkage Editor or the
                 PDS command, and verify that the offsets for the
                 various PAM routines are correctly entered (for your
                 release of Panvalet) in the code after the label
                 'LOAD' in module GTEUA10.  Also, because of the load,
                 ensure that the PAM routines are in SYS1.LINKLIB or
                 in a library named in your LNKLSTnn.

                 GTEUA40 dynamically links to PCOMPARE, and GTEUA60
                 dynamically links to PAN#1.  Ensure that these
                 programs are also in SYS1.LINKLIB or in a library
                 named in your LNKLSTnn.

                 Note, a STEPLIB can be used, but be aware that
                 STEPLIB is ignored under ISPF if you are using an
                 ISPLKLIB file.

       (  )  4.  Check the position of the name of this dataset,
                 SYS1.GTEUSRC, in the SYSLIB concatenation of the ASM
                 step in the instream proc.  Ensure that it is in a
                 position such that all datasets before it have equal
                 or larger blocksizes.

       (  )  5.  Supply JOB card information, and run the job.  All
                 modules will be assembled and linked into the
                 transient link library SYS1.GTEULK.  All modules will
                 be reenterable, reusable and refreshable.

       (  )  6.  Check job output.  IEW0461 messages about unresolved
                 external references to modules beginning with 'GTEU'
                 are okay.  There should be no other warning messages.


 STEP  4 - MEMBER $nnLINK - Linkedit the modules into load modules.

       (  )  1.  This step is required if you are installing without
                 SMP/E.  It is recommended if you are installing with
                 SMP/E.  This step creates the final, executable load
                 modules in the target library.  Running this step
                 before running SMP/E will tell you if you will have
                 any linkage editor problems.  This member will be
                 used as JCLIN for the subsequent SMP/E RECEIVE.

       (  )  2.  If you are not using the cataloged copy of the
                 datasets, fill in the VOL=SER information for the
                 following files, otherwise delete the VOL=SER
                 information.

                     SYSLMOD


 STEP  5 - MEMBER $nnREC - RECEIVE function GGU0200.

       (  )  1.  Modify the SMP/E JCL to reflect your installation's
                 standard.  The following DD statements are included
                 in all SMP/E jobstreams in this installation for the
                 current release.  (The GTEULK and GTEUSRC files are
                 not included for the DELETE of the previous release.)

                 //GTEULK   DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS1.GTEULK
                 //GTEUSRC  DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS1.GTEUSRC
                 //GTEULIB  DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS1.GTEULIB,VOL=SER=XXXXXX
                 //AGTEULIB DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS1.AGTEULIB,VOL=SER=XXXXXX

                 You must include them in your JCL, or define them to
                 SMP/E zones with DDDEF statements prior to this SMP/E
                 execution.

                 It is also assumed in all SMP/E jobstreams that
                 the following files are already defined in DDDEF's in
                 the target and distribution zones.  They therefore
                 have not been included in the JCL.

                        PROCLIB  - SYS1.PROCLIB   (TLIB)
                        APROCLIB - SYS1.APROCLIB  (DLIB)
                        GTELIB   - SYS1.GTELIB    (TSO command TLIB)
                        GTEHELP  - SYS1.GTEHELP   (TSO Help TLIB)
                        AGTEHELP - SYS1.AGTEHELP  (TSO Help DLIB)

                 If they are not in your DDDEF's, include them in your
                 JCL, or create DDDEF's for them.

       (  )  2.  If you are not using the cataloged copy of the
                 datasets, fill in the VOL=SER information for the
                 following files, otherwise delete the VOL=SER
                 information.

                     GTEULIB  AGTEULIB

       (  )  3.  Check job output.  There should be no error messages.


 STEP  6 - MEMBER $nnAPPX - APPLY CHECK the function.

       (  )  1.  Modify the SMP/E JCL as you did in the RECEIVE step.
                 Also, add the name of the target zone in the SMPCNTL
                 file.

                 If you are not using the cataloged copy of the
                 datasets, fill in the VOL=SER information for the
                 following files, otherwise delete the VOL=SER
                 information.

                     GTEULIB  AGTEULIB

       (  )  2.  Check job output.  GIM4051 messages from SMP/E are
                 normal.  These indicate that eventually SMP/E will
                 use the distribution library AGTEULIB instead of
                 the transient link library GTEULK as the permanent
                 residence for the ++MOD load modules.


 STEP  7 - MEMBER $nnAPP - APPLY the function.

       (  )  1.  Modify the SMP/E JCL as you did in the RECEIVE step.
                 Also, add the name of the target zone in the SMPCNTL
                 file.

                 If you are not using the cataloged copy of the
                 datasets, fill in the VOL=SER information for the
                 following files, otherwise delete the VOL=SER
                 information.

                     GTEULIB  AGTEULIB

       (  )  2.  Check job output.  GIM4051 messages from SMP/E are
                 normal.  These indicate that eventually SMP/E will
                 use the distribution library AGTEULIB instead of
                 the transient link library GTEULK as the permanent
                 residence for the ++MOD load modules.

                 There should be no error messages from the linkage
                 edits.  All modules should be marked reenterable,
                 reusable, and refreshable.


 STEP  8 - MEMBER $nnACCX - ACCEPT CHECK the function.

       (  )  1.  Modify the SMP/E JCL as you did in the RECEIVE step.
                 Also, add the name of the distribution zone in the
                 SMPCNTL file.

                 If you are not using the cataloged copy of the
                 datasets, fill in the VOL=SER information for the
                 following files, otherwise delete the VOL=SER
                 information.

                     GTEULIB  AGTEULIB

       (  )  2.  Check job output.  There should be no error messages.


 STEP  9 - MEMBER $nnACC - ACCEPT the function.

                 This step makes the DLIBs the residence of all the
                 executable code.  This will be assumed in later
                 maintenance, so an ACCEPT at this point is strongly
                 recommended.  If there is a problem, the entire
                 function easily can be deleted with SMP/E, and
                 reRECEIVEd later.

       (  )  1.  Modify the SMP/E JCL as you did in the RECEIVE step.
                 Also, add the name of the distribution zone in the
                 SMPCNTL file.

                 If you are not using the cataloged copy of the
                 datasets, fill in the VOL=SER information for the
                 following files, otherwise delete the VOL=SER
                 information.

                     GTEULIB  AGTEULIB

       (  )  2.  Check job output.  There should be no error messages
                 from the linkage edits.  All modules should be marked
                 reenterable, reusable, and refreshable.


 STEP 10 - MEMBER $nnUSRMD - Sample USERMOD to the function.

       (  )  1.  This step is a sample jobstream to create a USERMOD
                 to function GGU0200.  It does use SYS1.GTEUSRC and
                 SYS1.GTEULK as input TXLIB's.  Note the location of
                 this JCL for reference later in adding your own mods.
                 This job is a sample, only.  You should not run it.

    **************************************************************
    *  (  )  2.  Skip to STEP 11 to continue with the install.   *
    **************************************************************


 STEP  1A - MEMBER #nnADEL - (NON-SMP/E) Delete the prior release.

           ****************************************************
           ***   This step is only for a NON-SMP/E install. ***
           ****************************************************

       (  )  1.  If you have the prior release (R1.01) installed, this
                 job will delete it.  If you do not have the prior
                 release installed, skip this step.  Set the VOL=SER
                 operand in the JCL and the control card images.


 STEP  2A - MEMBER #nnAALLO - (NON-SMP/E) Allocate and catalog datasets

           ****************************************************

       (  )  1.  Rename this dataset you are reading to SYS1.GTEUSRC.

       (  )  2.  If you had already installed the prior release, you
                 can reuse the existing target library (GTEULIB) and
                 the distribution library (AGTEULIB).  You should
                 compress them, and check to see that all old members
                 were deleted by the previous step of this install.
                 A new transient linklib (GTEULK) should be created,
                 to avoid mixing old and new software.  The deinstall
                 of the prior release would not have affected the
                 transient link library or the source library.

       (  )  3.  Set the actual volume name in the DD1 and DD2
                 statements.  If you want space allocated on volumes
                 other than IPL volumes, follow the instructions in
                 the JCL comments.  Supply JOB card information, then
                 run the job.


 STEP  3A - MEMBER #nnAASM - (NON-SMP/E) Assemble GTEU modules.

           ****************************************************
           ***   This step is only for a NON-SMP/E install. ***
           ****************************************************

       (  )  1.  Module GTEUPUP in this PDS is the source module for
                 the TSO command processor.  One of its subcommands,
                 TSTATS, invokes the TSO commands PANINDEX and PDS.
                 If you do not have both the PANINDEX and PDS
                 commands, go into EDIT on the GTEUPUP source module
                 and comment out the two lines relating to the TSTATS
                 and TSTATUS subcommands at label SUTBL.  This is the
                 subcommand table of the TSO command processor.

                 If you delete TSTATS, also go into the HELP member
                 GTEUPUPH and delete the information about TSTATS and
                 TSTATUS after label ')S SUBCOMMANDS' and also after
                 label '=TSTATS=TSTATUS'

       (  )  2.  Module GTEUPUP dynamically allocates four temporary
                 datasets using the UNIT name of SYSTSO.  At labels
                 @WK and AWK in source module GTEUPUP, change the UNIT
                 name from SYSTSO to a valid name for your
                 installation.  If you need to, you can add a VLSER=
                 (not VOLSER) parameter to select a particular volume,
                 and you can optionally delete the UNIT parameter.
                 Just be sure the macros at @WK and AWK receive the
                 same changes.  If you need complete information on
                 the dynamic allocation macros, see macro GTEDADAT in
                 this dataset.

       (  )  3.  Module GTEUA10 dynamically loads the Panvalet Access
                 Method (PAM) routines.  It does this because the PAM
                 routines are not reenterable.  Get a map of the PAM
                 module with a utility like the Linkage Editor or the
                 PDS command, and verify that the offsets for the
                 various PAM routines are correctly entered (for your
                 release of Panvalet) in the code after the label
                 'LOAD' in module GTEUA10.  Also, because of the load,
                 ensure that the PAM routines are in SYS1.LINKLIB or
                 in a library named in your LNKLSTnn.

                 GTEUA40 dynamically links to PCOMPARE, and GTEUA60
                 dynamically links to PAN#1.  Ensure that these
                 programs are also in SYS1.LINKLIB or in a library
                 named in your LNKLSTnn.

                 Note, a STEPLIB can be used, but be aware that
                 STEPLIB is ignored under ISPF if you are using an
                 ISPLKLIB file.

       (  )  4.  Check the position of the name of this dataset,
                 SYS1.GTEUSRC, in the SYSLIB concatenation of the ASM
                 step in the instream proc.  Ensure that it is in a
                 position such that all datasets before it have equal
                 or larger blocksizes.

       (  )  5.  Supply JOB card information, and run the job.  All
                 modules will be assembled and linked into the
                 transient link library SYS1.GTEULK.  All modules will
                 be reenterable, reusable and refreshable.

       (  )  6.  Check job output.  IEW0461 messages about unresolved
                 external references to modules beginning with 'GTEU'
                 are okay.  There should be no other warning messages.


 STEP  4A - MEMBER $nnLINK - (NON-SMP/E) Linkedit the load modules.

           ****************************************************
           ***   This step is only for a NON-SMP/E install. ***
           ****************************************************

       (  )  1.  This step is required if you are installing without
                 SMP/E.  It is recommended if you are installing with
                 SMP/E.  This step creates the final, executable load
                 modules in the target library.  Running this step
                 before running SMP/E will tell you if you will have
                 any linkage editor problems.  This member will be
                 used as JCLIN for the subsequent SMP/E RECEIVE.

       (  )  2.  If you are not using the cataloged copy of the
                 datasets, fill in the VOL=SER information for the
                 following files, otherwise delete the VOL=SER
                 information.

                     SYSLMOD


 STEP  5A - MEMBER $nnACOPY - (NON-SMP/E) Copy modules.

           ****************************************************
           ***   This step is only for a NON-SMP/E install. ***
           ****************************************************

       (  )  1.  This step copies the modules from the transient link
                 library (GTEULK) into permanent DLIBs, and copies the
                 batch PROCs into SYS1.PROCLIB and into the DLIB for
                 SYS1.PROCLIB, and it copies the HELP member and its
                 ALIAS into the TSO HELP library and its DLIB.

       (  )  2.  If you are not using the cataloged copy of the
                 datasets, fill in the VOL=SER information for the
                 following files, otherwise delete the VOL=SER
                 information.

                     AGTEULIB
                     APROCLIB
                     SYSUT2 (STEP2, GTEHELP)
                     SYSUT2 (STEP3, AGTEHELP)

       (  )  3.  Check job output.  There should be no error messages.


 STEP 11 - MEMBER @nnPANLB - Create a Panvalet library from a PDS.

       (  )  1.  This job creates a backup Panvalet library for a PDS.
                 The Panvalet library name should be the same as the
                 name of the PDS, plus '.PANUPDTE' added to the end.
                 The Panvalet library name is not important in batch
                 processing, but the TSO command processor requires
                 this pattern.  ICF catalogs support naming
                 conventions such as these.  Choose a PDS, then fill
                 in the name at the bottom of the JCL.  The JCL will
                 generate the Panvalet library name.  (PDS name plus
                 '.PANUPDTE').  The examples use 'GTEL.CMDPROC', so
                 the Panvalet library name is 'GTEL.CMDPROC.PANUPDTE'.
                 The PDS you choose must have RECFM=FB and LRECL=80.

       (  )  2.  Compute the number of members you want to have in the
                 backup library, using the rule of thumb of one
                 cylinder in the SPACE allocation, for every 180
                 datasets on the DATASET operand.  (One Panvalet
                 'dataset' is required for each backup copy of a
                 member of a PDS.  Initially, you should start with
                 about 3 Panvalet datasets for each member of the PDS.
                 If your PDS has 120 members, you will want about 2
                 cylinders of space, which will hold about 360
                 Panvalet datasets in the Panvalet library.)

       (  )  3.  If your installation's Panvalet load modules are not
                 in SYS1.LINKLIB or in a library on the LNKLSTxx, add
                 the library name into the JOBLIB concatenation.

       (  )  4.  If you are not using the cataloged copy of the
                 datasets, fill in the VOL=SER information for the
                 following files, otherwise delete the VOL=SER
                 information.

                     JOBLIB

       (  )  5.  Run the job.  The condition code should be 0, 4, or
                 8.  If any of the following occur, you should be
                 aware of them.

                 CC=4 from GTEUAB0:
                    A PDS member name had @, #, or $ in it.  Since
                    PANVALET requires alphanumerics only, the data was
                    not copied.  The module name will appear in an
                    error listing from GTEUAB0 about 10 lines after
                    the '++SUPPRESS ++SOURCE' statement.

                 CC=8 from PAN#1:
                    o  Member names of patterns 'XXX' and 'XXX01' both
                       exist simultaneously in the PDS.  Processing
                       will continue.  'XXX' will be added to the
                       Panvalet library, then renamed to 'XXX01'.
                       'XXX01' will have to be added manually or in
                       batch by you as 'XXX0101'.  Find the member
                       name in the listing by searching for the
                       character string 'UNSAT'.

                    o  A member of the PDS had '++' in cc 1-2 of the
                       80-byte card image.  The Panvalet program tries
                       to interpret this as a Panvalet control card,
                       and take action, but cannot.  (Example:
                       '++MAC'.)  Processing will probably abort.
                       Although there are ways to force such a member
                       into the Panvalet library, it will only cause
                       you headaches later.  Move this member to some
                       other PDS which will not be processed by this
                       utility function, then recreate the library and
                       try again.

       (  )  6.  Look at the Panvalet Library Status and Activity
                 Report at the bottom of the listing (there is also
                 one near the top) to see how much space you actually
                 used in the load operation.  Space allocated will not
                 exactly match the amount you requested with the rule
                 of thumb, but it should be close.

       (  )  7.  If you are not familiar with Panvalet utilities, you
                 may want to save the JCL from STEP4, which uses PAN#2
                 to get hardcopy of the Panvalet library index.  If
                 ISPF statistics existed in the PDS directory entry
                 for a member, they should be converted to a Panvalet
                 comment.  If not, the comment should be 'INITIAL
                 VALUE.'


 STEP 12/13 - MEMBERS @nnBVRFY and @nnBCLEN - Verify batch operation.

             1.  These jobs verify the batch execution of the GTEU
                 driver functions.  The first job does the verify, and
                 the second cleans up the PDS and Panvalet library.

       (  )  2.  If you are not using the cataloged copy of the
                 datasets, fill in the VOL=SER information for the
                 following files, otherwise delete the VOL=SER
                 information.

                     JOBLIB

       (  )  3.  Run the first job.  Condition codes should be:

                     STEPNAME    COND
                     ========    ====
                     STATSB        12
                     STATSC        12
                     All others     0

                 The STATS output at the bottom of the listing should
                 show that the following exist:

                 In the PDS:   Member GTEUTEST   version 02
                               Alias  GTEUT1     deleted
                               Alias  GTEUT2     present

                 In Pan lib:   Member GTEUTEST01 2 records
                                      GTEUTEST02 3 records
                                      GTEUTEST03 4 records
                                      GTEUTEST04 the same as GTEUTEST01
                                      GTEUTEST05 the same as GTEUTEST02
                                      GTEUTEST06 the same as GTEUTEST05

       (  )  4.  Run the second job to clean up the datasets.

       (  )  5.  If you are not familiar with Panvalet utilities, you
                 may want to save this JCL for deleting members from a
                 Panvalet library, but you will probably choose to
                 restrict this information from end users.


 STEP 14 - MEMBERS @nnTVRFY and @nnBCLEN - Verify TSO operation.

                 This is a CLIST to verify the execution of the GTEU
                 command processor ('PUP') which, in turn, invokes the
                 same driver functions which were executed previously
                 in batch.  Additionally, the interface to HELP is
                 tested, and the interface to PANINDEX and PDS is
                 executed if you have those commands on your system.

       (  )  1.  Read the CLIST comments.  They describe a test PDS
                 which you need to create before running the CLIST.
                 Create the test PDS.  They also describe the use
                 of the TSO TEST command if your target library is
                 not currently active on your system.

                 Remember that to uncomment a line, you need to remove
                 the '/*' from the front end of the line, and also the
                 '*/' from the back end.

       (  )  2.  If you do not have the PANINDEX and PDS commands, and
                 you made the source change to the subcommand table in
                 GTEUPUP, the STATS subcommand will be ignored.  If
                 you do not have the commands, and you did not make
                 the source update, then comment out or delete the
                 CLIST lines invoking the STATS subcommand.

       (  )  3.  Execute the CLIST.  Condition codes should be zero
                 for all subcommands except the last two STATS.

                 The STATS output at the bottom of the output should
                 show that the following exist:

                 In the PDS:   Member GTEUTEST   version 02
                               Alias  GTEUT1     deleted
                               Alias  GTEUT2     present

                 In Pan lib:   Member GTEUTEST01 2 records
                                      GTEUTEST02 3 records
                                      GTEUTEST03 4 records
                                      GTEUTEST04 the same as GTEUTEST01
                                      GTEUTEST05 the same as GTEUTEST02
                                      GTEUTEST06 the same as GTEUTEST05

       (  )  4.  Run the same cleanup job as you ran after the batch
                 verify job to clean up the datasets.


 STEP 15 - ACF2 Rules.

       (  )  1.  If you have ACF2, a rule to restrict the update of
                 XXXX.CMDPROC only to the PUP command processor
                 which is in LPA, LINKLIB, or a library on the LNKLSTxx:

                   CMDPROC UID(*) READ(A) WRITE(A) ALLOC(P) EXEC(A) +
                        PGM(PUP) LIB('SYS1.LINKLIB')

                 The following rule would do the same for the batch
                 programs:

                   CMDPROC UID(*) READ(A) WRITE(A) ALLOC(P) EXEC(A) +
                        PGM(GTEUA**) LIB('SYS1.LINKLIB')


 STEP 16 -

       (  )  1.  Your installation is now complete.  Pat yourself on
                 the back.

       (  )  2.  If you want to pat ME on the back, or throw rocks,
                 give me a call or write to me.  I would just love to
                 know if anyone uses this.  I would also love to know
                 how long it took you to install, the method you used,
                 any problems you had, and any suggestions for
                 improvement in the product or the installation
                 procedures.
