This is a bunch of files to create a program to connect to VTAM
applications from TSO.

APPLTAB       - CSECT with applids (gets loaded by XIMTERM)
ASMAPPL       - JCL to asm/lked APPLTAB
ASMXIM        - JCL to asm/lked XIMTERM
SIMTERM@      - Original code from CBT tape
VTAMLIST      - Vtam stuff to be activated.
XIMTERM       - TSO command processor. Call it as follows:
                XIMTERM APPL(whatever).  Default appl is ROSCOE.

A few mods were made to original application, the most important in
SCIP exit. I tested this thing under OS/390 1.3.0 with VTAM 4.4 and
was able to connect to CICS, IBMLINK, ROSCOE and TSO.
