             MOD TO CHANGE CONSOLE DEFAULT PFKEYS.

 ATTENTION MVS SP1.3.X AND SP2.1.X USERS ....

     NOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SATISFIED WITH IBM'S SELECTION
 OF *** DEFAULT *** PFKEYS ANYMORE.  YOU CAN SET 'EM THE WAY
 YOU WANT 'EM, AND THEY WON'T FALL OFF AFTER AN IOGEN.

     I'VE CODED 2 SIMPLE USERMODS TO THE SYSGEN MACRO SGIEA2D2
 ON AGENLIB.  VERY SIMILAR CODING CAN BE USED EITHER ON SP1.3
 OR ON XA.  ONLY THE SEQUENCE NUMBERS ARE DIFFERENT.  THIS
 IS GOOD AT LEAST UNTIL SP2.2 COMES OUT, WHICH MAY CHANGE
 THINGS.

     PLEASE MAKE NOTE OF THE ONE FACT THAT THIS PROCESS SETS
 ALL CONSOLES WITH THE SAME PFKEYS.  AT LEAST YOU CAN GET THE
 DEFAULTS CLOSER TO WHAT YOU WANT.

     TWO USERMODS ARE SUPPLIED.  THEY WILL HAVE TO BE EDITED
 AND CUSTOMIZED TO YOUR SHOP.  THEY MUST BE ACCEPTED, TO HAVE
 AN EFFECT IN A SYSGEN OR IOGEN, UNLESS YOU CONCATENATE THE
 MTS ABOVE AGENLIB IN YOUR SYSGEN ASSEMBLY JCL.  SAVE A COPY
 OF THE ORIGINAL MACRO FOR A BACKUP.

     JUST USE MY SYSMODS AS MODELS.  COMPARE THEM TO THE
 VERSION OF MACRO SGIEA2D2 THAT YOU HAVE ON YOUR AGENLIB
 LIBRARY.  BE VERY CAREFUL WITH THE SEQUENCE NUMBERS, AND
 IT'D PROBABLY BE BEST TO FOLLOW MY SCHEME CAREFULLY.
 GOOD LUCK.

     ONE FURTHER NOTE.  THIS USERMOD IS RUNNING ON MY MVS/370
 SYSTEM, BUT I AM UNABLE TO TEST THE XA VERSION HERE.  A
 FRIEND ASSEMBLED AN XA SYSGEN WITH THE "IEBUPDTE"ED MACRO,
 AND THIS WAS SUCCESSFUL.  I COULDN'T PERSONALLY TEST THE
 RECEIVE, APPLY, AND ACCEPT OF THE XA USERMOD.  I TRIED TO
 BE CAREFUL, HOWEVER.  (IF IT IS RELEVANT, WE HAVE SMP4, BUT
 I AM FAMILIAR WITH SMP/E.)  (THESE NOTES ARE ANCIENT.  SG)
