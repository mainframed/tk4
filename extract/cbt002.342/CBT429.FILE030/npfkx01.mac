  PROBLEM DESCRIPTION(S):

        THIS USERMOD MUST BE ACCEPTED IN ORDER TO BE USED IN A
                  SYSGEN OR IOGEN ASSEMBLY.  PLEASE SAVE A COPY
                  OF THE ORIGINAL LEVEL OF THE MACRO SGIEA2D2.
                  THIS CAN BE FOUND IN THE DLIB SYS1.AGENLIB.
                  YOU CAN AVOID ACCEPTING THE USERMOD BY
                  CONCATENATING YOUR MTS AT THE TOP OF THE SYSLIB
                  DDNAME IN THE ASSEMBLY JCL FOR YOUR STAGE 1
                  IOGEN OR SYSGEN.  THE SMP APPLY PROCESS PUTS
                  AN UPDATED COPY OF THE MACRO SGIEA2D2 IN THE MTS.

        NEWSWEEK IS CURRENTLY RUNNING MVS/370 (SP 1.3.5).  USING
                  THE XA VERSION OF MACRO SGIEA2D2, I HAVE
                  CREATED AN XA VERSION OF THE USERMOD TO CHANGE
                  PFKEY DEFAULTS, AND TO MAKE SOME OF THEM
                  CONVERSATIONAL.  THIS MOD IS A MODEL, OR
                  SUGGESTION, HOW YOU CAN SET UP YOUR DEFAULT
                  PFKEYS ON YOUR OWN SYSTEM.  YOU WILL PROBABLY
                  NOT WANT THE SAME PFKEYS THAT WE ARE USING.

        PLEASE NOTE THAT THESE DEFAULT PFKEYS ARE THE SAME FOR ALL
                  CONSOLES.  ALSO PLEASE NOTE THAT WE CAN NOW SET
                  A PFKEY TO BE CONVERSATIONAL, BY DEFAULT, IF WE
                  WANT IT THAT WAY.  IBM DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THIS
                  AT ALL.  THE BYTE BEFORE THE PFKEY TEXT MUST BE
                  X'A0', FOR THE KEY TO BE USED, AND CONVERSATIONAL.
                  X'80' FOR THE KEY TO BE USED AND NON-CONVERSATIONAL.

        CAREFULLY NOTE HOW I CODED THE SEQUENCE NUMBERS IN THE MOD.

        THIS CUSTOMIZATION OF PFKEYS WILL NOW NOT DISAPPEAR
                  UPON PERFORMANCE OF AN IOGEN.  THIS USERMOD WILL
                  UPDATE THE SYSGEN MACRO SGIEA2D2, THAT GENERATES
                  THE ASSEMBLY OF DEFAULT PFKEY SETTINGS DURING
                  IOGEN.
