 THE FOLLOWING IS AN OLD MEMO THAT WE FOUND FOR DEBE DOC AT CBT, I
  THINK THE CODE MAY HAVE MORE COMANDS THAN WHAT IS DOCUMENTED HERE
  CHECK THE CODE, ITS PRETTY STRAIGHT FOWARD.

  SUBJECT-   MVS DEBE

  DATE   -   JUNE 21, 1977

  ENCLOSED YOU WILL FIND THE DESCRIPTION OF THE MVS DEBE UTILITY
  PROGRAM.

  IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT MVS DEBE OPTIONS SUCH AS TP AND SF REQUEST
  THAT THE OPERATOR SPECIFY THE NUMBER OF DATA GROUPS (RECORDS, FILES,
  ETC) TO BE OPERATED UPON. THE NUMBER OF DIGITS IN THE REPLY MUST AGREE
  WITH THE REPLY FORMAT SPECIFIED BY THE MVS DEBE ROUTINE. FOR EXAMPLE
  IN A TP (TAPE TO PRINT) OPERATION THE MESSAGE

       'DEBE=NR BLK TO PROCESS OR ALL-XXX'

  WILL BE DISPLAYED TO REQUEST THE NUMBER OF BLOCKS TO BE PRINTED. THE
  DESIRED REPLY IS 'XXX'-3 CHARACTERS. IF THE REPLY IS OF THE FORM

              R XX,1
       OR
              R XX,01

  AN ABEND WILL BE THE RESULT. THE PROPER REPLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN
  THREE CHARACTERS

              R XX,001

  THIS REPLY WILL RESULT IN PROPER COMPLETION OF THE TP FUNCTION.
