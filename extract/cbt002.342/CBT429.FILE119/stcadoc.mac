Documentation of Started Task Accounting Modification:


The started task accounting modifications (LM00038, LM00039) are very
simple to use. For each started task invoked by the START command, a
FIND macro is issued for a member of SYS3.STCACCT with the same name
as the started task. If no member by that name is found, the STARTED
TASK CONTROL module invokes the task without any accounting
information.  However, if the correct member is found, a READ macro is
issued to fetch card images from the contents of the member. Any I/O
error will cause the started task to be executed without any supplied
accounting information. The format of the control cards in
SYS3.STCACCT are as follows:



    Card #1 - This is the account card. It MUST be the FIRST card
C             in the dataset. Here is the format:
O   000000000100000000020000000003000000000400000000070000000008
L   123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890
#   ------------------------------------------------------------
             (U4757,U4757,000000),'PGMR''S NAME'

               * There are NO slashes in columns 1 & 2.
               * There is NO comma after the programmer's name
               * Account information is EXACTLY as how you
                 wish it to appear on the JOB card
               * The MSGLEVEL=1 parameter CANNOT be overridden

    Card #2 - This is an optional continuation card. Here is the
C             format:
O   000000000100000000020000000003000000000400000000070000000008
L   123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890
#   ------------------------------------------------------------

    //      MSGCLASS=A,NOTIFY=$UHMD

               * For this to be a continuation of the JOB card,
                 there must be NO text in column 3
               * If you wish to continue to a third card, the
                 text on this card must end in a COMMA AND column 3
                 on the next card must be BLANK.
               * If a COMMA is NOT the last character, the next
                 card will be ADDED between the JOB and EXEC card
                 for STARTED TASKS.
               * The MSGLEVEL keyword is NOT allowed, since it would
                 create a JCL error due to a duplicate entry.

    Card #3 - This is an optional control or OUTPUT card. Here is
C             the format:
O   000000000100000000020000000003000000000400000000070000000008
L   123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890
#   ------------------------------------------------------------

    /*JOBPARM  L=999,F=J012

               or

    //ABC    OUTPUT  FORMS=WXYZ,CLASS=2,JESDS=ALL

               * No BLANK in column 3
               * Any number of these cards may be inserted
               * Continue with a COMMA as the last character
                 and next card text begins in column 3
