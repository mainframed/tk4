)F   FUNCTION -

     The PDFINIT command is used to optionally initialize the
     environment for ISPF/PDF Version 2. Also, a dataset named
     'PREFIX.PROFILE.CLIST', or a character string representing a
     TSO command, can be optionally placed on the command input
     stack for execution after the PDFINIT command terminates.

     The catalog will be searched for a dataset named
     'USERID.ISPF.PROFILE' and, if found, will be allocated
     exclusivly to ddname ISPPROF. If the dataset cannot
     be located, one will be created on a TSO volume.
     If the NOISPF operand is supplied, this step will be
     bypassed.

     After allocation of the ISPF/PDF profile dataset, a search
     is made for a dataset named 'PREFIX.PROFILE.CLIST'. If such
     a dataset is found, an EXEC command specifying this file is
     placed on the command input stack. After PDFINIT terminates,
     the commands in this dataset will be executed by the TSO
     terminal monitor program. If the CMD operand is supplied,
     the command in this string is executed and the
     'PREFIX.PROFILE.CLIST' search and execution is bypassed.

     Normally, this command is placed in the PARM field of the
     EXEC card in a users TSO logon procedure. This will allocate
     the necessary PROFILE dataset for ISPF/PDF Version 2 and
     execute a string of initialization commands for each user.
     If a group of users share a logon procedure, the CMD operand
     may be used to execute a common CLIST from a group command
     procedure library.

     NOTE: This command MAY NOT be used from within a CLIST!

)X   SYNTAX -

     PDFINIT  ISPF/NOISPF  COMMAND('Command String')

     DEFAULTS - ISPF,(no command string)
     ALIAS    - NONE
     REQUIRED - NONE

)O   OPERANDS -

))ISPF        Indicates that the ISPF/PDF Version 2 profile
              dataset is to be allocated to the ddname ISPPROF.
              The profile dataset must be named
              'USERID.ISPF.PROFILE'.  If no dataset exits, one
              will be created on a TSO volume. This is the
              DEFAULT.

))NOISPF      Indicates that ISFP/PDF Version 2 processing is
              to be bypassed. No ISPF profile dataset is
              allocated, so ISPF services will be unusable
              if this operand is specified.

))COMMAND     Specifies a quoted string containing a single
              TSO command to be placed on the input stack. If
              quotes are contained within the command, double
              quotes must be used. A command length of up to
              256 bytes may be entered. When this operand is
              entered, the execution of 'PREFIX.PROFILE.CLIST'
              will be bypassed.

))CMD         This is an alias of the COMMAND operand.
