      SUBJECT:  Change Request #7002 - DASD SUBPOOL ALLOCATION


      LIS has opened Change Request #7002.  This change asks CIS to deve
      method which will allow users to allocate new datasets, on appropr
      DASD volumes, without specifying a volume serial ID.  For the sake
      convenience, I will refer to this change as "SUBPOOL ALLOCATION" f
      remainder of this discussion. The purpose of this document is to p
      background information explaining the need for SUBPOOL ALLOCATION,
      to define the technical requirements which must be satisfied.

      The changes described in this memorandum are intended to be compat
      with existing JCL, TSO commands, and CLISTS.  TSO commands and CLI
      that use dynamic, non-specific allocation will require no changes
      take advantage of SUBPOOL ALLOCATION benefits.  Batch users will n
      update their JCL before they can benefit from SUBPOOL ALLOCATION,
      JCL changes will not be mandatory.  Dataset creation under INTERAC
      be unaffected by this change.


      BACKGROUND
+     __________

      MVS allocation design restricts non-specific, non-temporary datase
      allocation to "storage" volumes.  Today, only WORK volumes are mou
      "storage", all other DASD are mounted "private".  MVS will allocat
      datasets on "private" volumes only when specifically requested.

      Excluding the WORK volumes, we have seven unique DASD subpools ava
      for user-allocated datasets.  Depending on the type of dataset to
      created, users must select a volume from one of the following subp
      when allocating new datasets:

      -  INTERACT           (5 x 3350 volumes)

      -  TSO                (5 x 3380 volumes)

      -  SAS                (6 x 3380 volumes)

      -  Production VSAM    (3 x 3380 volumes)

      -  Production NONVSAM (3 x 3380 volumes)

      -  User VSAM          (3 x 3380 volumes)

      -  User NONVSAM       (6 x 3380 volumes)

      I will refer to the above DASD subpools collectively as USER volum
      throughout the rest of this memorandum.

      PROBLEM STATEMENT
+     _________________

      With the current system, all non-temporary dataset allocations mus
      specific (i.e., the user must request a specific volume).  TSO com
      and CLISTS may request dynamic, non-specific allocations; however,
      allocations are converted to specific requests by a system exit ro
      This exit forces all non-specific requests for an individual user
      allocate on a single volume; volume selection is based upon an arb
      attribute assigned to each user's TSO account.

      The main problem with specific allocation is that requested volume
      not always contain adequate free space.  When a requested volume l
      sufficient space, dataset allocation fails and the job or transact
      aborts.  Typically, someone must update JCL or modify a CLIST befo
      aborted task can be re-executed.  In other cases, usually involvin
      dynamic allocation or program-generated JCL, the only practical so
      is for CIS to create free space on the required volume by deleting
      relocating existing datasets.

      Dependence upon specific allocation also complicates the process o
      managing DASD capacity within the USER subpools.  Whenever additio
      volumes are added to one of the USER subpools, JCL changes and/or
      account changes are required before new volumes can be used effect
      Installing extra DASD does not automatically fix space problems.


      RECOMMENDATION AND BENEFITS
+     ___________________________

      To resolve our current DASD space allocation problems, I recommend
      implement SUBPOOL ALLOCATION at the earliest possible date.

      From a user's perspective, the major benefit of SUBPOOL ALLOCATION
      be simplified data management procedures and reduced abends becaus
      out-of-space conditions.  Users will no longer be required to requ
      specific volumes when creating new datasets.  Instead, they will r
      space within a designated subpool (identified by the unitname para
      they specify).  The operating system will search all volumes withi
      requested subpool to locate a volume with enough free space.  User
      not need to concern themselves with which volume is allocated, as
      as they follow the recommended practice of cataloging all DASD dat

      Within CIS, the primary benefit will be more efficient DASD manage
      and more cost-effective use of our DASD resource.  DASD space prob
      will be easier to resolve since users' JCL, CLISTS, etc. will not
      to be changed to make use of newly-installed volumes.  New USER vo
      can be used as soon as they are added to a subpool.  In addition,
      allocation across all volumes within each subpool will be more eve
      distributed; as a result, the percentage of total space allocated
      the subpools can be increased.

      IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
+     _______________________

      The following actions are required to implement SUBPOOL ALLOCATION

      -  Define new esoteric unitnames for each USER and WORK subpool.
         to TABLE 1 for the proposed list of unitnames.

      -  Modify the JES exit 6 routine:   Direct all non-specific alloca
         to WORK volumes.  Refer to TABLE 2 for details.

      -  Modify the IEFDB401 exit routine:  Direct all dynamic, non-spec
         allocations to either TSO or WORK volumes.  Refer to TABLE 3 fo
         details.

      -  Change the mount status of all USER DASD volumes from "private"
         to "storage".

      The disadvantage of this plan is that MVS operational and technica
      support procedures will be more complicated.  Standard MVS procedu
      for defining device subpools require that esoteric names be associ
      with device addresses.  If we use standard MVS facilities to imple
      SUBPOOL ALLOCATION, we will usually have to perform an EDTGEN (a s
      of an MVS system generation) and system re-IPL whenever we reconfi
      DASD volumes.

      MVS user-modifications are available which will allow changes to d
      subpool definitions without requiring a re-IPL.  If we choose to u
      these modifications, the operational disadvantages of SUBPOOL ALLO
      will be insignificant.  *Censored* should decide whether it is bet
      depend upon standard MVS features, or to install user-modification
      implementing SUBPOOL ALLOCATION.


      SUMMARY
+     _______

      Please evaluate the technical and operational feasibility of this
      recommendation.  With your concurrence, the plan will be presented
      all SYNTEX Information Systems groups on Monday, April 28.  I will
      develop a detailed implementation plan once user-community agreeme
      has been obtained.
