)F FUNCTION  -
   THE XIX COMMAND IS A CLIST USED TO INQUIRE INTO THE SYSTEM
   DUMP INDEX DATASET. THE DUMP TITLES ASSOCIATED WITH A TAPE
   VOLUME ARE LISTED ALONG WITH THE TAPE VOLUME SERIAL
   NUMBER.

   THE DUMP DATASET INDEX, "SYS3.XFER.DATA", IS A WRAP-AROUND
   PARTITIONED DATASET. EACH MEMBER IS ASSOCIATED WITH A DAY
   OF THE MONTH.  ONE MEMBER  MAY CONTAIN AN INDEX OF
   MULTIPLE DUMP TAPES FOR A PARTICULAR DAY. THE PREVIOUS
   MONTH'S INDEX MEMBER IS OVERLAYED BY THE CURRENT DUMP TAPE
   INDEX MEMBER.

   THIS CLIST WORKS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE "XFERDUMP" CATALOGED
   PROCEDURE. THAT PROCEDURE UPDATES THE INDEX DATA SET BASED ON
   THE CURRENT DAY OF THE WEEK.

   IF THE PROPER OPERANDS ARE ENTERED, ISPF "BROWSE" SERVICES ARE
   INVOKED AGAINST THE SPECIFIED DUMP INDEX MEMBER.

)X SYNTAX -  %XIX D(XX)/TODAY/YESTERDAY/TOMORROW

   REQUIRED - NONE
   ALIAS    - NONE
   DEFAULTS - TODAY

   ALL OPERANDS ARE KEYWORDS
   ONLY ONE OPERAND MAY BE SPECIFIED, BUT NONE ARE REQUIRED

   UPON ENTERING "BROWSE", YOU MAY SEE THE CHARACTERS "PAD"
   FOLLOWED BY 77 DOTS. THIS MEANS THAT THERE HAS NEVER BEEN
   A DUMP TRANSFERED ON THAT PARTICULAR DAY SINCE THE INDEX
   WAS INITIALIZED.

)O OPERANDS -

   ALL OPERANDS ARE KEYWORDS
   NONE ARE REQUIRED; ONLY ONE MAY BE SPECIFIED

))D(XX) -
   SPECIFIES THE DAY OF THE MONTH FOR WHICH YOU WOULD LIKE THE
   DUMP INDEX DISPLAYED. IF THIS OPERAND IS SPECIFIED, THE INDEX
   DATASET IS SEARCHED FOR A MEMBER CORRESPONDING TO THE DAY
   NUMBER "XX". THAT MEMBER IS SUBSEQUENTLY "BROWSED" VIA ISPF/PDF.

   "XX" MUST BE A NUMERIC VALUE BETWEEN 1 AND 31.

))TODAY -
   SPECIFIES THE DUMP INDEX MEMBER CORRESPONDING TO TODAY'S
   TRANSFERED DUMP DATASETS. THIS MEMBER MAY OR MAY NOT
   CONTAIN A CURRENT ENTRY. HOWEVER, YOU CAN EASILY TELL IF
   YOU ARE LOOKING AT LAST MONTH'S ENTRY OR THE INITIALIZING
   PAD ENTRY BY EXAMINING THE CONTENTS UNDER "BROWSE".

))YESTERDAY -
   LIKE THE "TODAY" OPERAND, THIS KEYWORD SELECTS A MEMBER
   FROM THE DUMP INDEX DATASET. HOWEVER, THE SELECTED MEMBER
   CORRESPONDS TO A DAY NUMBER ONE LESS THAN THE CURRENT DAY.
   IF THE FIRST OF THE MONTH, "YESTERDAY" BROWSES THE LAST
   DAY OF THE PREVIOUS MONTH.  THUS, YOU "BROWSE" THE ENTRY
   CORRESPONDING TO "YESTERDAY'S" DAY OF THE MONTH.

))TOMORROW -
   SPECIFIES THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE "TOMORROW'S" DUMP
   DATASET INDEX. IN EFFECT, THIS OPERAND SHOULD PREDICT
   WHICH DUMPS WILL OCCUR TOMORROW AND ON WHICH TAPE
   VOLUMES THEY WILL RESIDE. THIS SEEMS LIKE AN IMPOSSIBLE
   TASK, BUT IN MVS ALL THINGS ARE POSSIBLE.
