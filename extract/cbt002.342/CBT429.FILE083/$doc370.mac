CHANGES TO OUTPUT FORMAT

1. THE UCB ADDRESS IS PUT ON THE OUTPUT PAGE JUST AFTER THE
   VOLUME SERIAL.
2. MESSAGE MAP000I WAS CHANGED TO A DOUBLE SPACE TO SAVE PAPER.
   IT IS THE MESSAGE THAT LISTS THE INPUT CARD AND IT SEEMED
   FOOLISH THAT A WHOLE PAGE BE DEVOTED TO THAT SINGLE LINE.
3. UNDER XA, NO CORE UTILIZATION STATISTICS WILL BE PRINTED.
   THE ORIGINAL CODE DEPENDED HEAVILY ON THE FORMAT OF OS CORE
   MANAGEMENT, AND THIS WAS CHANGED GREATLY IN XA.
4. IF THE PASSWORD PROTECTION BITS ARE SET, THEY ARE FORMATTED.
   THE THIRD COLUMN OF THE "TYP" FIELD WILL BE SET TO "R" IF THE
   BITS INDICATE READ PASSWORD NEEDED, AND TO "W" IF THE BITS
   INDICATE WRITE PASSWORD NEEDED.
5. DATASETS ON VOLUMES THAT ARE NOT CATALOGED IN USERID OR SPACE
   OPERATIONS ARE FLAGGED AS SUCH.


BUGS FIXED

1. MULTIPLE VOLUME DATASETS AND MULTIPLE VOLUME CATALOGS (REALLY
   MULTIPLE OS CVOLS) ARE SUPPORTED
2. CORRECT THE WAY THE UCB ADDRESS IS EXTRACTED.
3. CORRECT THE HANDLING OF THE L=, MIN=, AND MAX= PARAMETERS
4. GET THE SYSTEM RESIDENCE VOLUME ADDRESS CORRECTLY FOR
   XA MODE FUNCTIONING
