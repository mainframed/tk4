* THE FOLLOWING MOD IS THE INFORMATION NEEDED FOR INCORPORATING A
* 3380 MAPPPING CAPABILITY INTO IEHMAP
*
* THE MODIFICATION WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY MODIFYING A DEVICE TAPE IN
* THE MAPDEV CSECT OF IEHMAP.
*
* EACH LEVEL OF THE TAPE IS MAPDEV IS FORMATTED AS FOLLOWS:
*
*             FIELD NAME                      BYTES
*      DEVICE TYPE                              0
*      DEVICE DESCRIPTION                      1-15
*      SCALE FACTORS FOR CCHH OF DEVICE       16-23
*      NUMBER OF TRACKS PER CYLINDER          24-25
*      MAX RELATIVE TRACK FOR DEVICE          26-27
*
* THE 28 BYTES GIVEN BELOW REPRESENT THE SPECIFIC INFORMATION REQUIRED
* BY IEHMAP TO MAP 3380 DASD. A TABLE ENTRY FOR A DEVICE NO LONGER IN
* USE WAS OVERLAID WITH THIS DATA, THEREBY ELIMINATING ANY NEED TO
* EXTEND THE TABLE
