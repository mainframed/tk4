JESEX008  Program which will scan the jobs JCT and find out the
          max abend code for the given job.  This program must
          be in common storage.  I add a entry in IEALPAxx to load
          my version from a linklist library (SYS2.LINKLIB).

          I think there is one bug with this program . . . it seems
          that if a job is executing and some of the steps complete
          but a JCL error occurs later on, the condition codes are
          not set correctly.

JESEX016  This program works in conjunction with EXIT 8.  It takes
          whatever data is in the JCTUSER1 field and sends it to
          the user.
OACJCT    This is a copy of IEFAJCTB.  Since the JES JCT and the MVS
          JCT use the same name for some of the fields, and exit 8
          uses both JCT's there is a compile error if you don't do
          something about it.

SAS#BLOCK This is a little SAS program which uses a FDR VTOC
          list and gives recommended blocksizes for the type of
          device the data set is on.

TERMPROG  This is a CICS program which displays all the terminals
          signed on the system.  If you put the cursor a terminal
          and press enter, detailed information about the terminal
          is displayed.

TESTPRTR  Is a program which tests VTAM printers.  It also looks
          at the bind image sent and sends a message to the printer
          telling it what type of printer it is.

          Sample execution JCL:

        //STEP1    EXEC  PGM=TESTPRTR,PARM='FOACSDL9'
        //SNAP     DD    SYSOUT=*,DCB=(RECFM=VBA,LRECL=125,BLKSIZE=882)
        //SYSUDUMP DD    SYSOUT=*

          The parm field is the VTAM id.
