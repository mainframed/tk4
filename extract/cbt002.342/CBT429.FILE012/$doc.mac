 This tape consists of options designed to be used with the Interactive
 System Productivity Facility/Program Development Facility (ISPF/PDF).

 NOTE: Some of these options will work only under ISPF version 2.
 Panels/skeletons/messages provided for use with JH#PDF8 are intended
 only as samples.  Some modification (e.g., accounting fields) would
 be required at your installation.  Panels that contain a "volume
 serial" field determine a unit name in their )PROC section.  This
 should be checked for installation compatibility.

 Changes 03/04/85: Modifications to exploit ISPF version 2:  macro
        ISPCALL now supports ISPEXEC format (see new JH#PDF8 for
        example); JH#PDF8 modified to use LM services to enable VIO
        ISPCTLn data sets to be edited (under V1 JH#PDF8 works as
        before); panel JHAEFR01 added (used by JH#PDF8 under V2); JH
        ISR@PRIM replaced for V2; msgs JHA@M04 added; many
        panels/skeletons/messages formerly prefixed Z* are now prefixed
        JHA*; CLIST ISRCTBL renamed JH#YCTBL; JH edit interface altered
        for V2; CLIST TSEDITPR renamed JH#TEDPR and changed to process
        PDF V2 fields; added JH#GTDSN (a dialog program that returns
        volume serial and data set name when provided a ddname - used by
        other dialogs); added JH#TEDRT to display and edit a user's PDF
        edit recovery table; added ISRUOLJH, IBM's ISRUOL (PDF 3.8)
        modified to run faster by using temporary data sets; added
        JH#TPRGM to invoke IEHPROGM foreground; added JH#EDTMP to
        allow editing of VIO ISPCTLn data sets.
 Changes 10/18/83: Table display utility rewritten and enhanced.  CLIST
        renamed JH#YDTBL from ISRYDTBL.
 Changes 10/3/83: John Hancock edit interface is enhanced to allow
        user-defined abbreviations (see #3 below); small changes to
        JH#PDF8 and associated sample panels; added #6, #7, #8, #9.

 1. John Hancock Batch Jobs driver (JH#PDF8) is a general purpose ISPF
    function for the generation of JCL based on data entered on panels.
    Processing is controlled by an initial parm and by ISPF variables.
    See the comments at the beginning of the JH#PDF8 source for
    additional information.

    Some differences between PDF option 5 and JH#PDF8:  JH#PDF8 does
    not allocate data sets for verification, where option 5 optionally
    allocates the input data set (only); JH#PDF8 allows a user to edit
    the temporary generated JCL in addition to submitting or canceling
    the job; JH#PDF8 allows initial and final skeletons to be tailored
    for each invocation; JH#PDF8 allows two or more panels to provide
    input to one tailoring operation; with JH#PDF8 processing such as
    job character incrementation is done in the panels (see sample
    JHABP@B) instead of in the driver program.

    Sample panels, skeletons, and messages are provided for use with
    JH#PDF8.  It is possible, however, to create totally different ISPF
    components for use with this driver.  The only requirements are that
    there be a pseudo-selection panel whose name is passed via a parm to
    JH#PDF8 (sample is JHABP@A) and that the components set ISPF
    variables to dictate processing (again, see the comments).

    JH#PDF8 code is reenterant; the module may be placed in LPALIB
    with other ISPF modules.

 2. CLIST JH#YDTBL will display the contents (non-extension variables)
    of any table in table display (scrollable) format.  As provided here
    it supports five different table display formats.  It may be invoked
    from ISPF/PDF option 6, via the ISPF TSO command, or from a
    selection panel (e.g., ISRYXD1).

 3. Panel JHTEPE01 is a John Hancock edit interface.  To use it, add
    the following entry to a selection panel:
          n,'PGM(ISREDIT) PARM(P,JHTEPE01) NEWAPPL(ISR)'
    Note: future releases of PDF may not support this method of
    implementation.

 4. CLIST JH#TEDPR will display the contents of a user's current edit
    profile (for the application he has entered).  It may be invoked
    from ISPF/PDF option 6, via the ISPF TSO command, or from a
    selection panel.  The CLIST must be modified for your installation's
    ISPF profile naming convention.

 5. CLIST TSCMDTB will display the contents of the current system
    command table.  This may be used by end-users, since the
    "description," not the "action," is displayed.  If this CLIST is to
    be used, it is recommended that a copy of the system command table
    (ISPCMDS) be made under a different name (SYSCMDS is used in the
    CLIST).  Strange things will happen if you attempt to open and close
    a command table that ISPF has already opened.  TSCMDTB may be
    invoked from ISPF/PDF option 6, via the ISPF TSO command, or from a
    selection panel.

 6. CLIST JH#YCTBL drives the table reconstruction utility.  This allows
    fields to be added to/removed from tables without losing the table
    data.  It may be invoked from ISPF/PDF option 6, or from a selection
    panel (e.g., ISRYXD1).

 7. Panel JHAYP14@ provides entry to a foreground interface to the
    IBM-supplied selection panel update utility (ISPPUP).  This may
    be entered from a higher-level selection panel (xx,'PANEL(ZYPUP@)')
    or from TSO ready (ISPSTART PANEL(ZYPUP@)).

 8. CLIST ISRALTK allows a user to define and activate a second set
    of program function key definitions.  Read help panel XALTK before
    using.  It may be invoked from a selection panel (e.g.,ISPOPTA)
    by "'xx,CMD(%ISRALTK)'."  An entry in a command table is also a
    good idea:
                 VERB    ACTION
                  K2     SELECT CMD(%ISRALTK PARM('&ZPARM'))

 9. Panel PANELID is a example of how "PANELID ON" may be set without
    the user having to enter the ISPF command.  The code in this panel
    could be used in any selection panel, including ISR@PRIM and
    ISP@MSTR.

10. CLIST JH#TEDRT allows the displaying and modification of a user's
    edit recovery table.  It may be invoked from ISPF/PDF option 6, or
    from a selection panel.  The CLIST must be modified for your
    installation's ISPF profile naming convention.

11. CLIST ISRUOLJH is John Hancock's modified ISRUOL, the CLIST that
    drives PDF option 3.8.  It has been modified to run faster by using
    temporary data sets, bypassing cataloging and deletion.  It uses
    provided dialog program JH#GTDSN (which can be in LPA if heavily
    used).  (This CLIST has also been modified to use the same job cards
    as option 3.6.)

12. CLIST JH#TPRGM provides a panel to run IEHPROGM foreground.  To use
    it add the following entry to a selection panel:
       nn,'CMD(%JH#TPRGM PANEL(JHTEP0M) PANEL2(JHTEP0M2) SKEL(JHTES0M))'

13. Program JH#EDTMP puts the user into edit of an ISPF temporary
    control data set (ISPCTLn).  It supports VIO as well as DASD data
    sets.  If no parm is supplied, the data set associated with the
    current logical screen is used.  To access the data set used by the
    PDF SUBMIT command, use a parm of 0 (zero).  This program may be
    invoked via the ISPF select service from another dialog function.
    An entry may also be placed in a command table:
            VERB      T  ACTION
            EDTEMP    3  SELECT PGM(JH#EDTMP) PARM(&ZPARM) NEWAPPL(ISR)
    Then a user can enter the EDTEMP command on any screen and
    edit the data set.
