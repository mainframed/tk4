%----------------------------- GENERAL INFORMATION --------------------
+ISL Invocation (Continued)
 --------------

 The ISL primary options (continued):
     5 - SCAN     Scan library using specific or generic keyword(s)
              to locate manual titles containing the search value.
              If a scan file does not exist for the selected
              library, you will be notified and one will have to be
              created by the library administrator. Once completed
              you may then re-invoke the scan option.
     6 - ADMIN    Administrator functions for cross library processing
              (creating, deleting, sorting, compressing, building scan
              files and building sub libraries).
     X - EXIT     To exit from ISL.
