  This library contains the following goodies:-

   1. An edit macro called ZOOM which will display a JCL procedure
      while editing JCL. The cursor is placed on an EXEC statement
      in your job and the ZOOM command entered. The JCL proc will
      be displayed via a browse panel.

   2. An edit macro called JOBC which will generate a job card.
      This macro displays an entry panel and is documented via
      tutorial panels. The job standard is for L.O.L.A.'s  set
      up but can be changed.

                      A02MGN02                 -  messages
                      A02N....                 -  Help panels


   3. A program called Z7504 that will convert awkward characters
      such as ampersands and brackets in CLIST variables to other
      characters so that the CLIST can complete normally. This was
      written to cater for the situation where someone enters an
      ampersand in an ISPF panel variable and when the CLIST tries
      to do anything with the variable it blows up.

   4. A program called Z3426 - a CPU soak program to manage CPU
      resource. This program as it stands requires ACF2 but could be
      changed if ACF2 is not your security product.
