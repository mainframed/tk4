     LSPC is a TSO command highly modified from its origins in TSSPACE
(from file 127 of the CBT tape).  The LSPC command displays attributes
of devices.  If the device is direct access (DASD), space information
and mount status (private, storage, or public) will be displayed.  Space
will be displayed in format of free cyls, free trks, no. of free
extents, contiguous cyls and contiguous trks.
     Full information as to options, and the meanings of the flags (I
ran out of room on the output line) is in the help member (LSPCHELP)

     NOTE:  It would appear that this version will NOT work when using
HCD (dynamic IOCP).  I expect the next version will.  If anyone has a
sample program with UCBSCAN, or can update this program to use it,
please let me know.  Otherwise, I'll muddle through, myself.

     If anyone has ANY updates to be made to this code, please send such
to me rather than having several versions of this program running
around.
