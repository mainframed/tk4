)F Function -
        The LSPC command can be used to display attributes of devices.
   If the device is direct access (DASD), space information and mount
   status (private, storage, or public) will be displayed.  Space will
   be displayed in format of free cyls, free trks, no. of free extents,
   contiguous cyls and contiguous trks.

        The output display format is explained by issuing
            "HELP LSPC OP(OUTPUT)"

        This help member corresponds to version 4.3

)X Syntax -
     LSPC volser/address/ALL 'ADDRESS'/'GENERIC'/'CHPID' 'OFFLINE'
          UNIT(type...) MINPCT(##) MAXPCT(##) MINPATH(#) MAXPATH(#)
          MOUNT(type...) SMS/NONSMS IX/NONIX ALLOC/NONALLOC
          RESERVED/NONRESER CONSOLE/NONCONSO STACKER/NONSTACK
          IDRC/NONIDRC
     if any keywords are specified, volser/address/ALL must be also.
     Default - All online DASD

)O Keywords -
))volser    - volume serial of the direct access volume for which
              unused space is to be displayed.  All volsers which start
              with this string will be displayed.

))address   - specify the UCB address of the volume for which unused
              space is to be displayed.  All addresses which start with
              this number will be displayed (e.g. you can specify 1A to
              display all units on 1A0 thru 1Af).  If you choose this,
              you must also specify 'ADDRESS'.

))ALL       - All devices (as modified by other operands) will be used

))ADDRESS   - The first (positional) operand specifies an address
              rather than a volser.

))GENERIC   - The first (positional) operand specifies an esoteric
              or a generic device type (such as TAPE or 3390).
              When using this operand, the UNIT keyword will be syntax
              checked but ignored.

))CHPID     - The first (positional) operand specifies a 2-character
              hex CHPiD rather than a volser.  All devices on that
              CHPiD will be displayed.

))OFFLINE   - Display offline units in addition to online units

))MINPCT    - Only display volumes with at least ##% percent freespace.

))MAXPCT    - Only display volumes with at most ##% percent freespace.

))MINPATH   - Only display volumes with at least # functioning paths.

))MAXPATH   - Only display volumes with at most # functioning paths.

))UNIT      - Limit the display to the specified unit type.  Options
              are:
              ALL            - all devices except those excluded
              DASD/NODASD
              TAPE/NOTAPE
              UR/NOUR        - Unit Record
              GRAPH/NOGRAPH  - CRT's
              COMM/NOCOMM    - Telecommunications devices
))MOUNT     - Limit the display to the specified mount attributes.
              This operand is only meaningful for DASD.  Options are:
              STORAGE (or STG or STR) - devices mounted storage
              PRIVATE                 - devices mounted private
              PUBLIC                  - devices mounted public
              ALL  (default)          - don't check mount attribute
))SMS       - Limit the display of dasd to SMS managed volumes
))NONSMS    - Do not show SMS managed volumes
))IX        - Limit the display of DASD to those with Indexed VTOCs
))NONIX     - Do not show DASD with Indexed VTOCs
))ALLOC     - Show only allocated devices
))NONALLOC  - Do not show allocated devices
))RESERVED  - Limit the display of DASD to those hardware RESERVEd
))NONRESER  - Do not show DASD with hardware RESERVEs
))CONSOLE   - Limit the display of GRAPHIC devices to active consoles
))NONCONSO  - Do not show active consoles
))STACKER   - Limit the display of TAPE to those with ACL stackers
))NONSTACK  - Do not show TAPEs with ACL stackers
))IDRC      - Limit the display of TAPE to those IDRC capable
))NONIDRC   - Do not show TAPEs that are IDRC capable
))OUTPUT
            - There is one line per device.  The format is:
 volser cuu flags space-display device-type %-free #users path-info mnt

 "volser" is the volume serial number of DASD or TAPE devices
 "cuu" is the address of the device
 "flags": IASCR  I= indexed VTOC (if DASD) or IDRC-capable (if tape)
                 A= Allocated to a job, STC, or TSU
                 S= SMS managed
                 C= Active Console (if GRAPH device) or
                    "*" if the sysres volume (DASD)
                 R= Hardware reserve on the device
 "space-display":  cccc,tttt,eeee/cccc,tttt
              1st cccc is number of free cylinders
              1st tttt is number of free tracks
                  eeee is number of extents covering the previous
              2nd cccc is greatest number of contiguous free cylinders
              2nd tttt is greatest number of contiguous free tracks
 "device-type": hardware unit type
 "%-free": for DASD, percent of volume not used
 "#users": for DASD, number of allocations to the device
 "path-info": # mask chpids
              #       is number of online paths to the device
              mask:   nth byte 1 means nth chpid online
              chpids: 2-character CHPIDs defined to the device
 "mnt": for DASD, "PRI", "PUB", or "STG" to describe how mounted;
        for TAPE, more flags:  S = ACL Stacker (Auto Cartridge Loader)
                               A = ACL stacker Active
