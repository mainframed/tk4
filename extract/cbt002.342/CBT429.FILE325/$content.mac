DARTH    - The 'Dump Activity Reporter / Tape Handler' utility that
 (06/86)   processes SYS1.DUMP datasets. DARTH runs as a started task
           that wakes up every 15 minutes to check all defined dump
           datasets. When a dump is present, a tape is dynamically
           allocated, the dump is offloaded, and the dataset is reset.
           Then a control dataset is updated to record the system id,
           date, and time where the dump occurred, the tape volume
           idetification, and the actual title from the dump.

IEFUTL   - Wells Fargo's version of the SMF User Time Limit exit.
 (02/87)   You will NOT be able to use this code as distributed because
           some installation dependent, proprietary code is not shipped.
             This is an example of how to DISCONNECT A TSO USER rather
           than cancel when wait time is exceeded. The user then has
           however much time you allow in your RECONLIM= parameter to
           LOGON RECONNECT before VTAM automatically cancels the address
           space. The terminal becomes immediately available for use by
           other ids, and the disconnected id remains swapped out.
             See the code that refers to VTAM command: V NET,TERM, ...
           NOTE ===> This performs the same function through operator
             command that any user can invoke through keyboard action.
             If you are not familiar with CONDITIONAL LOGOFF, read
             "Invoking Unformatted System Service Type(COND) To Force a
             Reconnect Environment" in the TSO Terminal User's Guide.

INMXZ01  - TSO/E TRANSMIT Initialization exit to prevent transmission
 (08/85)   to non-existant TSO userids on same node as sender (JES2
           EXIT 13 handles NJE transmissions from other nodes) and
           thereby keep unreceivable data off JES2 spool.
             The exit searches the address list for a local node, then
           calls ACF2 to verify existence of user. If not valid, the
           userid is removed from the address list and an error message
           is issued to the sender.
           NOTE:  REQUIRES PTF UZ39974 (OR EQUIVALENT) BE INSTALLED
                  FOR CORRECT FUNTIONING OF "UNCHAINING" INVALID USERID.

INMXZ02  - TSO/E TRANSMIT Termination exit to issue equivalent of
 (01/85)   "$HASP549 MAIL FROM" message to notify receiving users of
           local node transmission. (Local transmissions do not pass
           through JES2 EXIT 13).
             The exit searches the address list for a local node, then
           verifies the output target is JES SYSOUT and transmission has
           successfully completed. "SEND '$HASP549...',USER=(),LOGON" is
           issued via SVC34.

JESLOGON - A program to allow a TSO user to logon to any SECONDARY
 (03/84)   subsystem. It acts as a one-time front end for the standard
           TMP, and is intended to be executed by the logon procedure.
           Job submissions and PSO (process sysout) requests are also
           handled by the secondary JES.

JESMAXCC - A pair of JES2 (SP2.1.5) exits that add text to the $HASP165
 (06/86)   message generated by NOTIFY= on the job card or by the JES2
           /*NOTIFY control card. If the job does not abend, the maximum
           condition code of all executed steps is added. If the job
           abends, the system or user abend code is added:
             $HASP165 yourjob ENDED AT node - MAX COND CODE 0000
             $HASP165 yourjob ENDED AT node - ABENDED USER xxx
             $HASP165 yourjob ENDED AT node - CANCELLED SYSTEM 222

NOTE     - Two CLISTs, one ISPF panel, and a help entry that provide a
 (01/86)   facility to deliver PROFS NOTEs from a TSO session:
             NOTE     - the driving CLIST, invokes WFBNOTE and NOTEIMAC
             NOTEIMAC - PDF EDIT initial macro for special formatting
             WFBNOTE  - ISPF panel to collect data for NOTE CLIST
             NOTEHELP - help entry for NOTE CLIST (rename to ==> NOTE)

           The NOTE command procedure (CLIST) uses the ISPF/PDF
           editor to build and format mail "notes", then sends them
           to PROFS or TSO users.  NOTE uses ISPF Dialog Services to
           collect information by displaying panels, therefore NOTE
           must be executed while ISPF is active.

           This facility was originally written to use the TSO TRANSMIT
           command for data transmission, but because PROFS can not
           decipher TRANSMIT control tags, NOTE now uses a specially
           modified version of the PRINTOFF command. This PRINTOFF,
           which allows DEST(node.user), is provided in this package.

OPCON    - OPerator CONsole monitor      MODIFIED FOR WFB 12/83
 (09/87)                                 TAKEN FROM CBT FILE338
                   S   P   Y             (NAME CHANGED TO "OPCON" IN
                                         THE CODE, BUT COMMENTS STILL
                                         REFER TO "SPY")

           This program displays the contents of all active GRAPHIC
           operator's consoles on a TSO CRT. The operator's screen can
           be either a 327X or a 370-168 integrated console. The TSO
           user can use any 327X terminal.

    V3.3.2 - CORRECT support for 327X Model 2 and Model 3 console.

    V3.3.1 - CHANGE CONSOLE ASID to 7 due to CATALOG ASID w/ DFP V2.

      V3.3 - ADD support for viewing consoles that have 3270 extended
             field attributes (e.g. 3179, 3180, 3279-3B, etc.).
           - MAKE OPCON non-swapable.
           - CHANGE CONSOLE ASID TO 6 for XA (S/370 CONASID is 5).

      V3.2 - ELIMINATE special character required to precede OS cmd
           - ELIMINATE secret auth SVC, restore MODESET and SVC34
           - CORRECT buffer address problem with line 1 of display
           - CORRECT loop count for UCM build routine
           - ADD subcommand A.. (AUTO W.. AFTER command entry)
           - ADD check at initialization for TSO OPER authority
           - MAKE command entry area non-display until passwd given
           - MAKE "oper redisplay" area modifiable for reentry
           - FILL both entry areas with nulls to allow char insert
           - REDISPLAY last cmd entered by user (instead of oper)
           - MOVE console status table to separate CSECT
           - RESTRUCTURE the help screen and use upper/lower case
           - PROVIDE TSO HELP entry as comments at end of source

PRINTOFF - The widely modified IPO supplied TSO command to print a
 (01/87)   dataset, with yet more functions added. After researching
           all versions on the CBT tape, Wells Fargo created this
           version from source from four separate files. We believe this
           contains all features currently available from all sources.

           R3 - * CORRECT ERROR, 'NOHEAD' miscounted 4 lines on page 1
                * ADD ASA keyword to accept CC when RECFM not ..A
                * ADD NOCC keyword alias of SINGLESPACE
                * ADD UDKFONT(...) keyword for XEROX 2700/3700 fonts
                * DELETE old lines marked *DELETED or 'DELETED CODE'

           R2 - * CORRECT ERROR, 'NOHEAD' caused blank first page.
                * CORRECT ERRORS in length of TEXTG through TEXTJ.
                * INCREASE input record limit to 32,760.
                * CHANGE DSNAME POSIT to DSTHING to allow for DDN().
                * CHANGE DEST keyword to accept 8 character value.
                * CHANGE DEST keyword to accept NODE and USERID.
                * ADD DDNAME(...) keyword to allow temp or VIO datasets.
                * ADD UNIT(...) keyword for use with VOLUME(...).
                * ADD 'VOLUME: volser' to heading when specified.
     +--------> * ADD Time and 'Monthname Day, Year' to DSN heading.
     :          * ADD NOMSGS keyword to stop non-error msgs to terminal.
     :          * ADD DSECT=YES to CVT macro for clean XA assembly.
     :          * MOVE all PUTLINE text to separate messages CSECT.
     :            --- (Following changes are WFB specific) ---
     :          * MAKE WFB default FORM($TST) in PARSE macro.
     :
     +-- NOTE ==> The Time-Date routine IKJEFLPA normally resides
                  ONLY in SYS1.AOST4. This library MUST be included
                  in the linkedit SYSLIB for proper resolution.

ROOM     - (This version is updated to JES2 SP2.1.5 level.)
 (05/86)   A TSO command to allow a user to change the "room number"
           field in the JES JCT for the TSO session. This command is
           necessary because the room number field is not supported by
           UADS (and the field is overlayed by Wells Fargo accounting
           information during logon). ROOM makes it easy for the user
           to specify delivery information (printed on JES header and
           trailer pages) for all SYSOUT created during the session,
           including spun datasets.

           This code can serve as a model for allowing a TSO user to
           change through authorized means any otherwise protected
           information in the JES JCT or similar control blocks.

VTAMCHK  - This program is intended to be started automatically after
 (03/84)   an IPL (by COMMNDxx). It is used to start VTAM applications
           or issue other commands in an orderly sequence after VTAM
           is up and running.

           VTAMCHK has the option to delay between issuing each command
           because some environments themselves have time dependencies,
           such as $SLOGON1   (wait for initialization)
                   $SN,A=xx
           The source has a sample of the procedure and some commands.

VTOCLIST - A corrected version of the GTE VTOCLIST program taken from
 (07/86)   the CBT tape. Corrections include:
           - Provide support for 3380 Model E devices.
           - Provide support for DF/EF VSAM files which are allowed to
             have more than 16 extents.
           - Two corrections to print extent numbers greater than 99.
           - A correction to print the "last ref data" and "use count".
