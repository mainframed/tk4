)F Function -
   The NOTE command procedure (CLIST) uses the ISPF/PDF editor to build
   and format mail "notes", then sends them to PROFS or TSO users.
   NOTE uses ISPF Dialog Services to collect information by displaying
   panels, therefore NOTE must be executed while ISPF is active.
)X Syntax -
   NOTE     PROLOG(YES/NO)  EPILOG(YES/NO)  COPYLIST(YES/NO)
            PROFNODE(node-name)
   Required - none
   Defaults - PROLOG(YES), EPILOG(YES), COPYLIST(YES), PROFNODE(EMINFO)

            NOTE can be executed from PDF 6 by enetring: %NOTE
            or from any 'COMMAND ===>' line by enetring: TSO %NOTE
)O Operands -
))PROLOG  - specifies whether :PROLOG. tags from your NAMES.TEXT
            dataset are to be inserted at the top of the message.
            ===> TSO TRANSMIT does not allow a colon in the text of a
                 tag, but PROFS requires a colon to recognize FROM:.
                 If your first prolog is  :PROLOG.From- name...
                 NOTE will change the dash to colon for mail destined
                 for PROFS. (This allows you to use the same NAMES.TEXT
                 dataset for TRANSMIT and NOTE.)
))EPILOG  - specifies whether :EPILOG. tags from your NAMES.TEXT
            dataset are to be inserted at the bottom of the message.
))COPYLIST - specifies whether a list of recipients is to be added as
            part of the message before it is distributed. If requested,
            the copylist is inserted at the top of the message before
            the prolog information.
))PROFNODE(node-name) - the name of the network node where PROFS is
            is running. This name is used to determine which recipients
            require PROFS header and trailer records added to the note.
