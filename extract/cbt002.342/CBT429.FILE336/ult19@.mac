-
        PRINTPDS and PUNCHPDS are ICSA-written utility programs which ma
        used to print or punch all members of a partitioned data set (PD
        PRINTPDS may be used to list a PDS of any record format and reco
        length.  The listing includes a table of contents to allow a
        particular member to be quickly found in the listing.  PUNCHPDS
        used to punch any card-image PDS.  The format of the output allo
        PDS to be recreated by the use of the IBM utility IEBUPDTE.
0       PRINTPDS and PUNCHPDS are supported as class A1 software (i.e.,
        program maintenance and consulting are supplied by ICSA).
-       USAGE
0       The JCL to run PRINTPDS or PUNCHPDS is outlined below.

0       A JOBPARM is required to specify the BIN number of the output.
                  also used for the following cases:
0                 If the PDS is to be punched, the CARDS parameter must
                  used to specify the maximum number of cards to be punc
0                 If the PDS to be printed is a print file (i.e., the re
                  format contains an A or M, indicating that the record
                  contains ASA or machine control characters), the LINEC
                  parameter must be specified to prevented unwanted page
                  ejects.
0                 See ICSA Document GEN001 for further information about
                  JOBPARM card.
0       The EXEC card should specify either PRINTPDS or PUNCHPDS as
                  "procname".  The following symbolic parameter is suppo
                  on the EXEC card for both procedures:
0                 DSN='dsname' - specifies the name of the PDS to be pri
                       or punched.  This parameter is required.
0                 The following symbolic parameters are supported only f
                  PRINTPDS:
0                 FORMS=formno - specifies the form number to be used wh
                       printing the PDS listing.  If this parameter is
                       omitted, the listing is produced on standard form
                       See ICSA Document GEN009 for a list of the specia
                       forms available at ICSA.
0                 TRAIN=train - specifies the print train to be used whe
                       printing the PDS.  If omitted, the PN train is us
                       For further information on print trains, see ICSA
                       Document GEN009.
0                 CTAPE=ctape - specifies the carriage tape to be used w
                       printing the PDS.  If omitted, the default carria
                       tape is used.  For further information on carriag
                       tapes, see ICSA Document GEN009.

                  LINECT=lines-per-page - specifies the number of lines
                       printed on each page of the PDS listing.  The def
                       value is 55.  If LINECT is set larger than 61, th
                       LINECT parameter of the JOBPARM card must also be
                       specified.  The LINECT parameter is ignored when
                       RECFM A or M data set is printed.
