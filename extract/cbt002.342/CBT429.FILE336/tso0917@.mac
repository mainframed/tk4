0     × 'message' is the message text enclosed in quotes.  The message m
      ×      at most 235 characters.
0       USER(useridlist) is the list of recipients of the message. This
             required.
0     × BELL indicates the bell on an ASCII terminal is to be sounded wh
      ×      message is received and the prefix '*ATTN*' is to be typed
      ×      terminal prior to typing the message. For EBCDIC terminals,
      ×      which no bell exists, only the prefix '*ATTN*' is sent.  AT
      ×      a synonym for BELL.
      × FLASH indicates that the bell is to be sounded on an ASCII termi
      ×      even if the user is not receiving messages (i.e., has set P
      ×      NOINTERCOM).  For such a user, only the bell is sent; neith

      ×      EBCDIC terminals will not receive any indication of the att
      ×      to send a message.
      × Note: If neither BELL nor FLASH is specified, these attention-ge
      × will not be sent.
0     × WAIT[(interval)] indicates that the message is to be sent to eve
      ×      user in the list before the issuing user may proceed.  The
      ×      subparameter "interval" may be used to specify the number o
      ×      seconds (up to 99) the issuer is willing to wait for the me
      ×      to be sent; if no interval is specified, there is no limit
      ×      length of the wait.  Note that the WAIT may be cancelled at
      ×      time by use of the attention key (in which case any users w
      ×      still busy will not receive the message).
      × NOWAIT indicates that the message is to be cancelled for any bus
      ×      so that the issuing user does not have to wait to continue.

0     × INTERRUPT specifies that if a receiving user is entering input w
      ×      the message is sent, he should be interrupted so it can be
      ×      written immediately.  This specification will be ignored fo
      ×      kinds of terminals (e.g., IBM 2741 terminals when the user
      ×      not issued TERM BREAK).
      × NOINTERRUPT specifies that a user active in input is not to be
      ×      interrupted.  This is the default.
