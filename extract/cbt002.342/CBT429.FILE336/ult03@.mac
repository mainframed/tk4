0                         Sequential Copy Utility (SEQCOPY)
-
        SEQCOPY is a utility program designed to quickly copy one sequen
        data set (or PDS member) to another.  This program offers the
        following advantages over IEBGENER, the IBM utility designed to
        perform the same function:
0         .  SEQCOPY uses 40 to 60 % less CPU time than IEBGENER.
0         .  SEQCOPY can be used to change the record format or record l
             of a data set.  (Records are truncated or padded with blank
             necessary.)
0         .  SEQCOPY prints the number of records copied so that correct
             operation can be verified easily.
0         .  SEQCOPY allows recovery from input errors by use of the ERO
             suboperand of the DCB operand.
0         .  SEQCOPY accepts concatenated data sets on different device
             (such as cards and disk) as input.
0       The following features of IEBGENER are not supported by SEQCOPY:
+                                              ___
0         .  Partitioned output, input editing, and other functions requ
             by IEBGENER control statements.
0         .  Copying keyed data sets.
0         .  Copying LRECL=X data sets.
0       Note that neither IEBGENER nor SEQCOPY may be used to copy load
        modules.
0       SEQCOPY was developed at Baylor College of Medicine and is suppo
        as class C1 software (i.e., consulting is available but no maint
        is provided).  See ICSA Document UTL013.002 for further informat
        IEBGENER.
-       USAGE
0       The cataloged procedure named SEQCOPY may be used to run the
        sequential copy utility.  A listing of this procedure is availab
        reference in the User Clinic.  The Job Control Language (JCL)
        available at ICSA is described in ICSA Document GEN001.  The JCL
        shows all the DD cards that the user might need to include when
        SEQCOPY.  When these cards are included, they must be in the sam
        order as shown.
