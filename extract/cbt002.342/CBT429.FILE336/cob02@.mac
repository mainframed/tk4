0                      Julian-Gregorian Date Conversion Routine
-
        JULIAN is a subroutine that may be called from COBOL to convert
        Julian date (i.e., year, day of year format) to a Gregorian date
        (i.e., month, day of month, year format) or vice versa.  It can
      × be used to obtain the current date in both formats.  Optionally,
      × JULIAN can return the day of the week of the date converted or
      × obtained.  JULIAN uses a table lookup method which converts all
        dates from the year 1901 to 2099 correctly.  Note that the only
        validity check performed on the input date is a range check on t
        Gregorian month.
-       USAGE
0       JULIAN resides in the RICE.COBLIB library.  The ULIBDSN paramete
        any ICSA COBOL cataloged procedure with link-edit or load steps
        used to access this library as follows:
0         cc 1
             //stepname   EXEC  procname,ULIBDSN='RICE.COBLIB'
0       Alternatively, the following SYSLIB DD cards may be added to JCL
        any COBOL cataloged procedure with link-edit or load steps.
0         cc 1
             //step.SYSLIB  DD
             //             DD  DSN=RICE.COBLIB,DISP=SHR
0       In the JCL above, "step" refers to either LKED or GO depending o
        cataloged procedure being used.  See ICSA Document COB001 and CO
        for the placement of these cards in the deck and for additional
        information on the ULIBDSN parameter and the SYSLIB DD card.
0     × The JULIAN subroutine may be called with two or three arguments.
        first argument must be a five digit numeric field that is used f
        input/output of the Julian date represented by YYDDD; the second
        argument must be a six digit numeric field that is used for
      × input/output of the Gregorian date represented by MMDDYY.  The t
      × argument is optional; if provided, it must be a one digit numeri
      × field into which the day of the week will be placed (1=Sunday,
      × 2=Monday,...7=Saturday,0=don't know).  The arguments must be def
        or defaulted as USAGE IS DISPLAY but need not be contiguous fiel
      × When JULIAN is called, one or both of the first two arguments mu
        zero (but not blank).  JULIAN converts the input dates as follow
0         .  If only the Julian argument (i.e., the first argument) is z
             the Gregorian date in the second argument is converted to J
             format and stored in the first argument.
          .  If only the Gregorian argument (i.e., the second argument)
             zero, the Julian date in the first argument is converted to
             Gregorian format and stored in the second argument.
          .  If both arguments are zero, the current date is converted t
             Julian and Gregorian formats and stored in the first and se
             arguments, respectively.
0     × If the day-of-week argument (i.e., the third argument) was speci
      × a simplified version of Zeller's Congruence is used to compute t
      × of the week.  Note that ridiculous dates will usually return a
      × "reasonable" value (e.g., the 32nd of December will be the day a
      × the 31st); a zero is returned only if a Gregorian date is suppli
      × with a month greater than twelve.
