        TAPESCAN is a utility program which can be used to print informa
        about the contents of labeled or unlabeled tapes.  It may also b
        to copy files from one tape to another.  When TAPESCAN is used t
        "scan" a tape, the following functions may be requested:
0     ×   ø  A "volume table of contents" (VTOC) listing may be produced
      ×      including, for labeled tapes, the name and DCB attributes o
      ×      each file.
0     ×   ø  The number of blocks and the minimum, maximum and average
             block length may be printed for each file.  This informatio
             is used to compute an estimate of the length of the used
             portion of the tape.
0         ø  A specified number of blocks from each file may be listed i
             character form.  Optionally, they may also be listed in
             hexadecimal.  Only the first 120 characters of each block a
             listed.
0         ø  Program operation may begin at any file of the input tape.
0         ø  Operation may continue past one or more end-of-volume
             indications.  This feature may allow the retrieval of some
             data from tape files which have been partially overwritten.
0       When TAPESCAN is used to copy, the following functions may be
        requested:
0         ø  All or part of one tape may be copied to another.  Output m
             start at any file of the output tape.
0         ø  All or part of an input tape may be copied onto the end of
             output tape.
0         ø  When a labeled output tape is used, the output volume seria
             normally remains unchanged.  The user may request, however,
             that the output tape's label is to be copied from the input
             tape or is to be destroyed.
0       The following restrictions exist on the use of TAPESCAN.
0         ø  Files from an unlabeled tape may not be copied to a labeled
             tape unless the label is to be destroyed.
0         ø  Only a single volume may be used for input or output.
0         ø  TAPESCAN cannot copy to a completely blank output tape.  To
             use TAPESCAN to copy to such a tape, the user must first
             request initialization of the tape, as described in ICSA
             Document GEN008.
0         ø  All data files of a 7-track input tape must be written at t
             same density and using the same recording technique (TRTCH)
             These DCB parameters must be specified correctly in the JCL
0       TAPESCAN was written by the Institute for Research in Social Sci
        at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and has been
      × extensively modified by ICSA and other SHARE members.  TAPESCAN
      × supported as class A1 software (i.e., consulting and maintenance
      × available from ICSA).

-     × Three cataloged procedures are available to run TAPESCAN:  TAPES
      × TAPEMAP and TAPECOPY.  The function of each procedure is as foll
0     ×      TAPESCAN -- To scan a tape, producing a fairly verbose summ
      ×           the tape contents.  This PROC is recommended for unkno
      ×           possibly invalid tapes, or when a listing of data reco
      ×           required.
0     ×      TAPEMAP  -- To scan a tape, producing only a volume table o
      ×           contents and diagnostic messages.  The omission of the
      ×           summary and listing of data records makes the output e
      ×           to read (and the run less expensive), but some details
      ×           "problem tapes" may be lost.  (See Appendix B for deta
      ×           information on the interpretation of the volume table
      ×           contents.)
0     ×      TAPECOPY -- To copy one tape to another.
0       A listing of these procedures is available for reference in the
        Clinic.  The Job Control Language (JCL) available at ICSA is des

                                   TAPESCAN OPTIONS
-     × TAPESCAN options are specified through the OPTIONS parameter of
      × EXEC statement.  Options are provided to specify the amount and
        of output, the number and position of tape files to be processed
      × whether or not tape copying or ASCII translation is to be perfor
      × The valid TAPESCAN options are described below.  Each option is
      × followed by an indication, within parentheses, of the PROCs for
      × it is valid (where S indicates the TAPESCAN PROC, M the TAPEMAP
      × and C the TAPECOPY PROC).
0     × NOSUM (S) - specifies that a summary of label information (for a
      ×      labeled input tape) is not wanted.  This also suppresses th
      ×      volume table of contents.
      × FULLSUM (S,C) - specifies that each input tape label is to be li
      ×      in addition to the normal summary information.
      × MAPONLY (C) - specifies that only a volume table of contents is
      ×      (i.e., that the normal, more verbose label summary is to be
      ×      suppressed).  Note that MAPONLY is ignored if the LIST opti
      ×      specified.  MAPONLY is implied when the TAPEMAP procedure i
      ×      used, and should not be specified explicitly with this PROC
      ×      MAPONLY may be abbreviated as MAP.
0     × Note: If none of NOSUM, FULLSUM, or MAPONLY is specified (for th
      × TAPESCAN and TAPECOPY PROCs), a detailed summary of information
      × the labels is printed for each file of a labeled tape, in additi
      × the normal VTOC listing described below.  Information printed in
        the file sequence number, data set name, creation date, date of
      × modification, expiration date, number of blocks in the file (BLO
      × COUNT), protection status, and the name of the job and job step
        created the file.  The DCB parameters RECFM, LRECL, BLKSIZE, TRT
        (for an ASCII tape only) BUFOFF are also printed.  See the IBM m

        the contents of tape labels.
0     × COUNT (S,M) - specifies that the number of blocks on each tape f
      ×      to be determined, together with the maximum, minimum and av
      ×      block length.  This is normally the default.
        NOCOUNT (S,M) - specifies that block count and length informatio
             not to be determined.  This option reduces the number of I/
             operations required to process a tape.  NOCOUNT is recommen
      ×      only for use with labeled tapes.  NOCOUNT is the default wh
      ×      TAPEMAP PROC is used with a labeled tape.
0     × LIST=n (S,C) - specifies that the first 120 characters of the fi
      ×      records of each input file are to be printed.  The default
      ×      LIST=4 except when MAPONLY is specified (or defaulted by th
      ×      TAPEMAP PROC).
      × NOLIST (S,C) - specifies that input data records are not to be l
      ×      If MAPONLY is specified, NOLIST is the default.
0     × HEX (S,C) - specifies that listed data records and/or labels are
      ×      printed in hexadecimal as well as in character form.
0     × LINE=nn (S,M,C) - specifies the number of lines to be printed pe
      ×      page.  The default is 59.
0     × SKIPTM=n (S,M,C) - specifies the number of tape marks (which sep
      ×      physical tape files) to be skipped on the input tape before
             beginning processing.  Note that before the tape marks are
             skipped, the tape is positioned as specified by the IFILE
             parameter of the EXEC card.  SKIPTM will not cause a tape t

             action is taken, as described in Appendix C.  Note that on
             labeled tape there will be three tapemarks for each data fi
0     × STOPTM=n (S,M,C) - specifies the maximum number of physical inpu
      ×      files to be processed.  Files skipped as a result of the IF
             parameter of the EXEC statement or the SKIPTM option are no
             included in this count.  STOPTM will not cause a tape to be

             processed beyond an end-of-volume indication, except by use
             the options described in Appendix C.  If STOPTM is not spec
             processing will terminate upon reaching an end-of-volume
             indication.  Note that, for a labeled tape, three physical
             exist for each data file on the tape.
0     × ERRLIM=n (S,M,C) - specifies the maximum acceptable number of I/
      ×      errors.  The default is ERRLIM=5.  Until the I/O error limi
             reached, program operation will continue, without regard to

             error indications.  When an input error occurs, data will b
             exactly as received.  This may cause incorrect information
             incorrect-length blocks to be written to an output tape.
0     × EOVMOD (C) - specifies that the input tape is to be copied onto
      ×      end of the output tape (i.e., after the output tape's curre
             last file).  If a file number is specified in the JCL OFILE
             parameter, the point at which to begin output is determined
             locating the first end-of-volume indication after the speci
             file of the output tape.  When the number of the last file
      ×      tape is known, ICSA recommends the use of the OFILE JCL par
      ×      in place of EOVMOD, to be sure that output begins at the ri
             file of the tape.
0     × UNLABEL (C) - specifies that the copy operation is allowed to de
      ×      the output volume label, change the output volume serial nu
      ×      or write labels on a previously unlabeled tape.  If UNLABEL
             not specified, the output volume serial will not be changed
             Note that UNLABEL should NEVER be used if either the input
             output tape is an ICSA R7 or R9 series tape.
0     × ASCII=IN (S,M,C) - specifies that the input tape contains inform
      ×      coded in ASCII.  This parameter need not be specified if th
             input tape has ANSI standard labels; it will be ignored if
             input tape has IBM standard labels.  Note that TAPESCAN can
             successfully convert ASCII data sets with record format D t
             EBCDIC.
0     × ASCII=OUT (C) - specifies that the output tape is to contain
      ×      information coded in ASCII.  This parameter need not be spe
             if the output tape has ANSI standard labels; it will be ign
             if the output tape has IBM standard labels.  Note that TAPE
             cannot successfully convert EBCDIC data sets with record fo
             to ASCII.  Warning: TAPESCAN may be used to produce ASCII t
             containing data sets with a block size less than 18 or grea
             than 2048; such data sets are in violation of the ANS stand
             for tape labeling and may cause problems in later use.

0     × Individual columns in the table of contents are as follows:
0     ×    SEQ - the sequence number of the file.  For a labeled file, t

                        ACCESSING DATA BEYOND "END OF VOLUME"
-       Occasionally, there is need to access data recorded on a tape be
        an end-of-volume indication (two consecutive tapemarks).  There
        two possible reasons for such access.  First, if a tape file con
        no data, a double tapemark will occur, even though more files ma
        physically follow on the tape.  Second, when a tape is overwritt
        end-of-volume indication is automatically written at the conclus
        output.  Any previously written information beyond this indicati
        will remain recorded on the tape, and all but the first block th
        can usually be read without error.  Thus, when a tape has been
        erroneously overwritten, some of the previously recorded informa
        may be accessible beyond the end-of-volume indication.
0       TAPESCAN provides two additional options to allow the reading of
        information beyond an end-of-volume indication, as follows:
0       SKIPEOV=n - specifies the number of end-of-volume indications to
             skipped on the input tape before beginning processing.  SKI
             processing is performed after the input tape is positioned
             file indicated in the IFILE JCL parameter.  If SKIPTM and S
             are specified together, the SKIPTM processing is performed
             the SKIPEOV processing is complete.  The default for this o
             is SKIPEOV=0, specifying that processing is to begin at the
             of the tape.
0       STOPEOV=n - specifies the number of end-of-volume indications to
             processed before processing is terminated.  The default is
             STOPEOV=1, which indicates that processing is stopped the f
             time end of volume is indicated.  If both STOPTM and STOPEO
             specified, processing will terminate when either the indica
             number of tape marks or the indicated number of end-of-volu
             indications are encountered.
0       Note that when SKIPEOV and/or STOPEOV are used with a tape which
        been overwritten, an I/O error should be expected on the first b
        following the end-of-volume indication.
0       Even with the options described above, attempting to retrieve da
        recorded beyond an end-of-volume indication can be frustrating a
        time-consuming.  For this reason, ICSA strongly recommends that
        who need to use the SKIPEOV and/or STOPEOV options see the consu
        in the User Clinic before attempting their use, especially with
        which has been overwritten.
-       Example 1: Scan a 9-track tape whose label type is unknown, gett
             information about the maximum and minimum length of each bl
             List the first 120 characters of 10 records from each data
             Continue past the first end-of-volume indication until a se
             end-of-volume indication is located.

        Example 2: Copy information after the first end-of-volume indica
             an overwritten tape to an unlabeled tape.  Terminate the co
             more than one I/O error occurs.  Note that an overwritten i
             tape should be described in the JCL as unlabeled, even if l
             are present, or were present before the overwriting.  This
             misrepresentation may be necessary because any tape labels
             present beyond the end-of-volume indication are unlikely to
             correctly describe the remaining data.
