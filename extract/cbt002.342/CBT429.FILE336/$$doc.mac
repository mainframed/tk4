      This is a collection of utilities, macros, TSO commands, usermods,
      other stuff from Rice University.  We run MVS/SP 1.1.1 with base-l
      JES2 (EJE1102),  and all of this is  working at that level.   (We
      run UICC's JTIP and ACF2, which are occasionally referenced.  We t
      we have removed all serious dependencies on these products.)
0     Some of this is updated/corrected versions  of stuff we originally
      from the 1-23-82 version of the mods  tape.   Therefore some of it
      have  been superseded  or complicated  by  other changes  to the
      programs since then.

0     This collection includes:
0          TAPESCAN, a tape scanning/copying utility especially suited t
+       ø
           diagnosis of over-written or otherwise screwed-up tapes.  Thi
           version of  TAPESCAN  includes  extensive  support  for  ANSI
           labelled  tapes,  and  a lot  of  security support  (includin
           password, expiration date and ACF2 security checking).
0          DISKUTIL, an IEHPROGM replacement.
+       ø
0          SEQCOPY, an IEBGENER replacement.
+       ø
0          PRINTPDS,  a utility to print all members of a PDS,  no matte
+       ø
           what record format.    It produces a table of  contents and a
           alias cross-reference.
0          MAPDISK,  another VTOC mapping utility (unrelated to others o
+       ø
           the same name).
0          A version of dynamic MLPA (or MODREP)  with some horrible bug
+       ø
           fixed.   (Now we know why it stopped working when we installe
           low-memory protection!)
0          CLUTSPAR,  a friendlier version of IKJPARS.   Try it,  and yo
+       ø
           won't want to  go back!   Note that CLUTSPAR  does not suppor
           any TSO/E  features such  as the PARSE  interface to  the HEL
           command,   due  to  lack  of information  on  how  they  work
           (CLUTSPAR is a fragment of a project called TSU, which starte
           out as a mechanism for writing TSO command processors in PL/I
           and  eventually sprouted  replacements for  major portions  o
           TSO.   TSU as  a whole has never quite become  clean enough t
           release, but CLUTSPAR is such an enormous improvement over th
           competition that we decided to make it an exception.)
0          The Language Independent  Environment (LIE),  a set  of macro
+       ø
           and routines to let you  write assembler subroutines which ca
           take advantage  of services of  the PL/I environment,   plus
           pseudo-PL/I  environment manufacturer,   to  provide the  sam
           services in the  absence of PL/I.   CLUTSPAR  is a pseudo-PL/
           application in this sense.
0          The XSEND TSO command, for improved communication with logged
+       ø
           on TSO users.   Now you can send with WAIT and break out of i
           if you get  tired of waiting!   XSEND includes a  user SVC fo
           controlled use  of TPUT HIGHP (to  send bells/alarm to  tell
           NOINTERCOM user someone wants to "speak" to him).
0          LISTM, a nice TSO command to list PDS member names.
+       ø
0          LISTU,   a nice  TSO  command to  list  TSO  users (sorted  b
+       ø
           userid).
0          UPUT, UPROMPT and UGET, macros to use as replacements for TPU
+       ø
           and  TGET   that  interface  to  the   PUTLINE/PUTGET  servic
           routines.  They make conversion of old TSO code so it will ru
           under a batch TMP much easier.

0          XWTO,  a macro to allow WTO messages to be built from segment
+       ø
           without having to compute all the offsets.
0          UHB macros,  a set of utility macros to make writing big macr
+       ø
           applications (like XWTO turned out to be) much easier.
0          A JULIAN routine (originally written  to be called from COBOL
+       ø
           to convert dates between Julian  and Gregorian format,  and t
           determine the day of the week.    This routine is not all tha
           interesting, but it is used by some of the other submissions.
0          SAVEX and RETURNX macros,  yet  another example of an extende
+       ø
           SAVE and RETURN.   Again,  not that interesting,  but used al
           over by our other code.
0     The  above  are   (except  for  the  XSEND  SVC   and  CLUTSPAR)
      applications, and require  no SMP work.    We are also  providing
      packaged SYSMODS to support:
0          A modification to the JES2 $DF  command to allow selections o
+       ø
           the  types of  data  sets to  be  displayed.    This mod  als
           introduces  the $XF  command,  which  displays  each job  wit
           output of the specified kind.
0          A big mod  to JES2 output processing to provide  counts of th
+       ø
           actual number of pages printed for a job, based on definition
           of  forms and  carriage  tape layouts  contained  in the  JES
           initialization parameters.
0          A mod to  TSO functional accounting (SMF type  32 records)  t
+       ø
           record response-time-related  information in place of  some o
           the more esoteric  present information,  and to  not require
           pre-assembled list  of interesting  commands.   Included  is
           report program to  summarize the records contained  in a batc
           of SMF data.
0          A version of the mod to add  the maximum condition code to th
+       ø
           JES2 NOTIFY message.
0          A  JES2 mod  to  display the  converter  ABEND  code when  th
+       ø
           converter crashes.   (Now who would ever  want to know a thin
           like that?)
0          A mod  to remove "CN(00)"  from NOTIFY messages  (and anythin
+       ø
           else sent via internal SEND commands).
0          A mod  to stamp  a new format  1 DSCB with  the userid  of it
+       ø
           creator (from the SMF userid field).  With ACF2 (and the righ
           ACF2 options), this will be the ACF2 logonid.
