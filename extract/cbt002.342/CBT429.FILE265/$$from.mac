This started life as LOGONXIT from BEN MORE of SCHERING-PLOUGH from
about May of 1979. We at BFGoodrich modified it and enhanced it all
the way through ESA 3.1.0. At that time CA-Top Secret said that they
would not support password prompting with exits installed at IKJEFLD,
when that exit eliminated IBM's security checking code via flags.

With the installation of ESA 4.2, we decided that the time had come
to let IBM and CA do the security checking without help from this exit.
This implied a major overhaul of the code. At the same time we were
looking to reduce the usage of the Authorization SVC in our shop.
Thus we decided to implement the functionality of the original
LOGONXIT via the new exit points provided by TSO/E 2.3. It allowed
us to use the normal IBM full screen logon panel, and most of the
normal IBM checking.

As we got into the coding, we realized that modifing the panel would
be a good idea and that IBM allowed for modified panels. In SAMPLIB
are the distributed panels that you normally run with. The panel is
able to be modified, but the restrictions and coding rules are very
difficult. This led to the implementation of the macros in MACLPENU.
This made panel writing much easier. With the start of testing, we
realized that IBM never fully tested the new exits in TSO/E 2.3.
See the comments in IKJEFLDN for the necessary PTFs that must be
applied for V2.3 (V2.3.1 has different PTF numbers).

Things undone:
1. Documentation for macros in MACLPENU.
2. Cleanup and final documentation for IKJEFLDN.
