To install the logon exit, the following steps are necessary:

1. Adjust the JCL in JCLEFLDN and submit it. The link library should
   be one in the LPALSTxx or MLPA list.  Note if you MLPA, then all
   four names should be MLPAed : IKJEFLD1, IKJEFLD3, IKJEFLN1,
   IKJEFLN2.

2. Adjust the JCL in IKJLPENU and submit it. The link library can be
   any one. This module MUST be MLPAed with name IKJLPENU to override
   the one supplied in IBM's LPALIB.

3. Shutdown and reIPL with CLPA. After the IPL, your new exit and
   panel are active. If they dont work, use your back up facility
   to rename them or delete they. (You DO have a back up facility
   don't you).
