The following example illustrates the use of the variables
&SYSOUTLINE, &SYSOUTTRAP, &SYSNSUB, and &SYSINDEX:

In this example, the output from the STATUS command will be trapped
and then listed, excluding the TSU status line.  The example is
commented to explain the operation.

 CONTROL ASIS END(XIT)        /* ASIS allows for mixed case data
 SET &SYSOUTTRAP = 200        /* Trap up to 200 lines of output
 STATUS                       /* Issue the STATUS command
 SET &T = &SYSOUTLINE         /* Save number of trapped lines
 SET &SYSOUTTRAP = 0          /* Trap no more lines of output
 SET &I = 0
 SET &CTR = 0
 WRITE
 DO WHILE &I < &T             /* Loop till all trapped lines examined
   SET &I = &I + 1            /* Next line
   SET &X = &SYSNSUB(2,&&SYSOUTLINE&I) /* Put trapped data in a variable
   SET &A = &SYSINDEX(JOB,&X) /* Look for "JOB"
   IF &A = 1 OR &A = 11 THEN +
     DO
       SET &A = &SYSINDEX(TSU,&X,11+&A) /* Look for "TSU"
         IF &A = 0 THEN       /* not found */ +
           DO
             WRITE &X
             SET &CTR = &CTR + 1
           XIT
     XIT
    ELSE                      /* Can't find JOB anyplace */ +
     DO
       WRITE &X
       SET &CTR = &CTR + 1
     XIT
 XIT
 IF &CTR = 0 THEN +
  WRITE You have no JOBs in the system.
