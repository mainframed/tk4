1 Firstly, a seql. data set consisting of all-members in system
  must be created (Edid.Member.List). Format of it is shown as:

  Col  1 - 8  member
  Col 11 - 16 volser
  Col 17 - 60 dataset name

* After step 2 is completed, this dset can be deleted.

2 Then the job JOBM must be executed. This will prepare the VSAM data
  sets.

3 The PL/I program PLIM finds the member you want by using this VSAM
  path file.

4 Sample job result :
   input  : SIL member..
   output : like the folllowing..


   MEMBER      VOLSER    DSNAME
