Hi,

I dont know exactly if there is something like that, but I have a
utility which can find all datasets having same member. (Im not sure how
I should call it, actually depending on the input which is a member
name, the utility can say which datasets in which volumes have the same
member as input). For instance if you enter;  " readme"
as a member name in a panel, the results would look like;

dset                volume
====                ======
SYS1.xyx            mvspr1
sdiagas.user.jcl    tsot01
epdm.reports        prod02    In this case those 3 dsets have the
                              member whose name is "readme"

I hope I can contribute to CBT tape just a little bit. ust let me know
if it would be helpful...

I think it will not be as good as those on the CBT tape. But actually
it could have been better by using ISPF panels. better yet with Assembly
lang.    (In my opinion, it's very good as is.    S. Golob 5/98)
