*
*    : THIS MEMBER CONTAINS INSTALLATION GUIDELINES.  ALL DIALOG
*      COMPONENTS ARE CONTAINED IN THE PDS WHICH YOU ARE CURRENTLY
*      ACCESSING.  TO STORE EACH COMPONENT IN IT'S PROPER PRODUCTION
*      LIBRARY, SIMPLY REPLACE THE FIRST CHARACTER OF EACH MEMBER NAME
*      WITH AN 'A' DURING COPY OPERATION. THIS WILL EFFECT A MEMBER NAME
*      THAT IS PREFIXED 'ARC' FOR EACH MEMBER THAT IS "FARMED OUT" INTO
*      IT'S APPROPRIATE PRODUCTION LIBRARY TYPE.  FOR EXAMPLE, MEMBER
*      CRCLIST INDICATES, BY VIRTUE OF THE FIRST CHARACTER BEING "C"
*      (AKA "CLIST"), THAT IT SHOULD BE STORED INTO A SYSPROC LIBRARY
*      TYPE AS MEMBER NAME ARCLIST.  THIS TECHNIQUE IS USED SO AS TO
*      ALLOW A CONSISTENT  3 CHARACTER "APPLID" ("ARC") ACROSS ALL
*      ISPF/PDF LIBRARIES AS WELL AS ALLOWING THE STORAGE OF ALL
*      APPLICATION COMPONENTS INTO ONE COMMON (NON-PRODUCTION) PDS.
*      THIS TECHNIQUE PERMITS THE "INSTANT" INSTALL OF THE APPLICATION
*      WITHOUT HAVING TO MAKE ANY CHANGES TO THE ACTUAL MEMBERS.  ALL
*      VARIABLE POOL VARIABLE NAMES HAVE ALSO BEEN PREFIXED "ARC".  NOTE
*      THAT TUTORIAL PANEL MEMBER NAMES ALWAYS END WITH CHAR "T".
*
*      NO HARD AND FAST TECHNIQUE EXISTS FOR MANAGING DISPARATE DIALOG
*      COMPONENTS BUT THIS METHOD HAS SERVED ME WELL AND I'VE FOUND IT
*      TO BE VERY USEFUL WHEN PROBLEMS ARISE AND IT'S TIME TO GO
*      "FISHIN" FOR PARTS THAT HAVE BEEN LONG BEEN FORGOTTEN!
*
*
*    : REVIEW PANEL MEMBERS SUFFIXED "T" (TUTORIALS) FOR A FUNCTIONAL
*      OVERVIEW OF THIS APPLICATION.
