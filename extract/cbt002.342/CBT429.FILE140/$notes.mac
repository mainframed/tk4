* DOC: DOCUMENT THE ABL "POOR MAN'S HSM" DATA ARCHIVAL/RECOVERY SYSTEM

_  SYSTEM FLOW

   _ QUARTERLY ARCHIVAL TO TAPE OF ALL DSNS WITH REFDATE GT 365 DAYS

    _ ARCHIVAL JOBSTREAM OUTPUT = ONLINE MEMBERS OF ABL.ARCDASD.REPORTS

    _ MEMBERNAME REFLECTS DASD VOLSER AND ARCHIVE DATE (MONTH/YEAR).
      FOR EXAMPLE, MEMBERNAME USR10689 WOULD CONTAIN A LIST OF ALL USER
      DATASETS ARCHIVED FROM VOL=USER01 DURING THE JUNE '89 ARCHIVE RUN.

    _ DSN=ABL.ARCDASD.REPORTS IS DUPED ONLINE QUARTERLY AS DATASETNAME
      'ABL.ARCDASD.REPORTS.CLONE'.  'ABL.ARCDASD.REPORTS' MEMBERS THAT
      ARE CREATED EACH QUARTER ARE THEN MANUALLY EDITED VIA SPF TO
      REMOVE REFS TO "DELETED" MESSAGES. THESE MESSAGES ARE NOT NEEDED
      BY THE ARCDASD SYSTEM'S "LIST" COMMAND AND THEIR DELETION AFFORDS
      A SIGNIFICANT LIST COMMAND EXECUTION REDUCTION. THE HARDCOPY FOR
      EACH QUARTER'S RUN IS THE DEFINITIVE ARCHIVAL INFORMATION, IF EVER
      NEEDED.  DATASET 'ABL.ARCDASD.REPORTS.CLONE' IS IDENTICAL TO THE
      HARDCOPY INFORMATION.  SHOULD DATASET 'ABL.ARCDASD.REPORTS' BECOME
      UNUSABLE, ".CLONE MAY BE RENAMED WITH NO LOGICAL IMPACT ON THE
      ARCDASD SYSTEM.

   _ MODIFICATIONS TO THE SPF 3.4 (DATASET UTILITY) PAMEL WERE MADE TO
     REFERENCE OPTION "ARC" IN THE ABL CUSTOM UTILITIES MENU.
     UPON USER SELECTION OF THIS MENU (VIA =3.A.ARC), THE "LIST" COMMAND
     WILL ALWAYS BE DEFAULTED, ALLOWING A LIST TO BE PRODUCED OF ALL
     ARCHIVED DATASETS BELONGING TO THE USER. AFTER VIEWING THIS REPORT
     A HARDCOPY OPTION IS PROVIDED. USERS DESIRING TO RECOVER ARCHIVED
     DATASETS MUST PRINT, MARK, AND PRESENT THIS LIST TO DP. DP WILL
     THEN USE THE "ARC" PANELS TO RESTORE THE ARCHIVED DSN(S) BY SIMPLY
     FILLING IN A FEW PANEL FIELDS. THE USER IS AUTOMATICALLY NOTIFIED
     WHEN THE DATASET(S) RESTORE JOB IS SUBMITTED BY DP.
