of title information to be printed at the bottom of even numbered
pages.

where optional "n", from one to the value of the HSFSOVER option,
gives the even footing line number
and S1, S2 and S3 are character strings not containing the
delimiter character "/".
The delimiter character can be any character defined
as the first character of the operand.  Any of the fields may
be omitted, but the delimiter character must be included to
indicate missing fields, e.g., $S1$$S3$.
.SUBT Usage
The .EB control word is used in the same way as the .BT
control word.  The footings defined with .EB will appear only on
.FNADD
.ur even numbered &LP pages, however.
.fn begin
.in
.ur .of &OFN
.ur (&NFN.) Even numbered pages are bound on the right margin.
.fn end
The number of footing lines printed on even pages is set by .FS
(Footing Space).
.SUBT Defaults
A break is not created by this command.  Unless otherwise
specified ".EB
.SUBT Notes
.of 4
(1) The EVEN BOTTOM control has the same effect as the EVEN FOOTING
(.FV) control.  The difference is that the field delimiter is
self-defined by the first character of the operand.
