.cm SCRIPT REFERENCE FN
.SUBT Purpose
The FOOTNOTE control word allows the user to enter a footnote which
will be printed at the end of
the current page.
.SUBT Format
×                <BEGIN×END>
×  .FN
×                SET n </S1/S2/S3>
.SUBT Usage
When the ".fn
values of all relevent control variables are
saved and SCRIPT prepares to accept footnote text.
.sp 1
When the ".fn
saved by the ".fn
of output continues.
.sp 1
SCRIPT saves enough room at the bottom of the page to print the
footnotes and separator lines.
If enough room does not exist, footnotes will be continued at the
bottom of the next page.
Any formatting control word may appear within a footnote
except another Footnote (.FN) or Keep (.CP, .FK, .FB) control word,
a page eject (.PA) or an Immediate Line (.LN).
Space (.sp) requests
in footnotes are normally forced to single space mode
and all formatting requests apply _o_n_l_y to the
.FNADD
.ur footnote&LP..
.fn begin
.in
.ur .of &OFN
.ur (&NFN.) Format controls in effect when the ".fn
encountered remain in effect during formatting of
the footnote unless explicitly overridden.
For example, if indentation
of the text has been requested with a .IN control word, the
footnote will also be indented unless
the .IN is altered within the footnote.
.fn end
.sp 1
The SET function is used to define the footnote separator lines.
The ".FN
that separate the bottom of the body of text from the top
of the Bottom Margin.
The initial value of "n" is three and "n" must be a numeric
value from one to the HSFSOVER parameter, normally nine.
.sp
The ".FN
"n" of the footnote separator.
The "/S1/S2/S3/" operand is like Top Title (see .TT)
where "S1" would be left adjusted in footnote separator
line "n", "S2" would be centered and "S3" would be
right adjusted.
The initial values for all separator lines is blank
except for the second which is a centered row of dashes "-"
of length one third the line length.
.SUBT Defaults
This command does not create a break.  An operand must be provided
as none will be assumed.
.SUBT Notes
.in 10
.un 4
(1) Footnotes are always initialized to single spaced output.
The Line Spacing may be altered and will remain in effect
until the end of the Footnote.
.un 4
.cp 2
(2) No more than the value of the FNSIZE= parameter (normally 200)
footnote lines may be waiting for output at any time.
.un 4
.cp 3
(3) The ".fn
regular input
.FNADD
.ur line&LP
.fn begin
.in
.ur .of &OFN
.ur (&NFN.) That is, the first line after the ".fn
.fn end
will be concatenated with the previous line.
.un 4
.cp 4
(4) No footnotes will appear on a page if at least 4 lines are not
available at the bottom of the text area.
If footnotes are generated within 5 lines of the bottom, they will be
saved for the next page.
This assumes a footnote separator depth of three lines.
.un 4
.cp 4
(5) The line which precedes a footnote definition will always be
printed on the current page.  It can never be
displaced to the next page by accumulation of footnotes.
.un 4
.cp 2
(6) Footnotes appear at the bottom of the text area,
NOT in the Bottom Margin area set by the ".bm" control word.
.cp 3
.un 4
(7) A ".FN BEGIN/END" sequence within a Keep or another footnote
is considered illegal.
.cp 3
.un 4
(8) A Floating Keep (.FK) or Conditional Page (.CP or .CC) text
block that prints starting at the top of a page
will displace footnote lines on that page if the text block
extends down into the footnote area above the Bottom Margin.
.cp 3
.un 4
(9) Footnote numbering, as used in this manual, is described in the
section "NOTES ON THIS DOCUMENT", in the Appendices.
