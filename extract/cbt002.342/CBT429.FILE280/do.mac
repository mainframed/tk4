.cm SCRIPT REFERENCE DO
.SUBT Purpose
The DO control word may be used following a Then or Else control
word to allow multiple input lines to be conditionally included.
.SUBT Format
×
×  .DO           <B_E_G_I_N_×END>
×
.SUBT Usage
This control word may only be used as the object of a Then (.TH)
or Else (.EL) control word.
The input control word and text lines from the .DO to the next
corresponding ".DO
are all treated as the object
of the Then or Else and are included or ignored depending on the
truth value of the preceeding If.
.sp
Further Ifs within a Do group are valid, as are Imbeds (.IM) and
Signals (.SI).
.SUBT Defaults
The ".do" control word does not act as a break in itself.
However, control words within the Do Group may create a break.
If no operand is specified then "BEGIN" a Do Group is assumed.
.SUBT Examples

(1) ^ur ^if '&copy' = 'F';^th ^do begin
^tt //FINAL COPY//
^do end
^el ^do begin;^tt //DRAFT COPY//;^do end
.sp;.fo yes
This will define one of two Top Titles depending on
the value of variable symbol "&copy".
