to be printed at the top of even numbered pages.

where optional "n", from 1 to the value of the HSFSOVER option,
gives the heading line number
and S1, S2 and S3 are character strings not containing the
delimiter character "/".
The delimiter character can be any character defined
as the first character of the operand.  Any of the fields may
be omitted, but the delimiter character must be included to
indicate missing fields, e.g., $S1$$S3$.
.SUBT Usage
The .ET control word is used in the same way as the .TT
control word.  The headings defined with .ET will appear only on
.FNADD
.ur even numbered&LP pages, however.
.fn begin

.ur .of &OFN
.ur (&NFN.) Even numbered pages are bound on the right margin.

The number of even page heading lines printed is set by .HS
(Heading Space).

specified ".ET
.SUBT Notes
.of 4
(1) The EVEN TITLE control has the same effect as the EVEN HEADING
(.HV) control.  The difference is that the field delimiter is
self-defined by the first character of the operand.
