.SUBT Usage
The .FS control word controls the number of footing lines to be
printed at the bottom of a page.
Up to HSFSOVER footings may be defined
and printed at the bottom of each page.
An operand of the form "+n" or "-n" adds this value
algebraically to the current footing space setting, so long as
the resulting value is not negative.
.sp 1
If the footing margin is f_m_, the footing space is f_s_ and the
bottom margin b_m_, the bottom of each page will appear as follows:
.sp 1
.in 10
.of 4
(1) f_m_ blank lines,
.of 4
(2) the f_s_ footing lines,
.of 4
(3) b_m_ - f_m_ - f_s_ blank lines.
.SUBT Defaults
This command word creates a break when encountered
and until then n_
effect.  The value of the operand may range from zero to
the HSFSOVER parameter, normally nine.
If the operand is omitted n_
