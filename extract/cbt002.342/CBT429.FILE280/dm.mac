.SUBT Purpose
The DEFINE MACRO control word defines a sequence of input
lines to be invoked by "name" as a user-defined
control word or as a SIGNAL (.SI) operand.
.SUBT Format
×                name /line1/.../linen</>
×  .DM           name <BEGIN×END>
×                name DELETE
.SUBT Usage
The .DM control word is used to define and delete
a user macro.
such user macros may be used for common sequences
of control words and text.
Keyword and positional parameters "&*", "&0", "&1", etc.
may be checked and substituted when the macro is called.
.sp
The user macro is known by "name", a one to eight character
identifier.
The macro defines a sequence of control words and text lines
that are invoked by a ".name" macro call or ".SI name" Signal.
.sp
The user macro may be defined in two ways.
The first is on one input line with the lines of the
macro being separated by a self-defining character shown
in the command prototype as "/".
Longer user macros are defined with a "name
and "name
The ".DM
record.
.sp
A user macro may be deleted by specifying "name
as an operand.
"name
.SUBT Defaults
This control word does not create a break when defined.
It does not create a break when called either, although
the macro may contain control words which will cause a
break.
