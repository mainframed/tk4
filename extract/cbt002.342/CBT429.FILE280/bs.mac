.cm SCRIPT REFERENCE BS
.SUBT Purpose
The BACKSPACE control word specifies the input character to be
treated as a logical backspace and a hex join character.
.SUBT Format
×
×  .BS           <char> <H_J_O_I_N_×NOHJOIN>
×
.SUBT Usage
In all subsequent input text and control lines, each occurrence
of the character "char" will be replaced with the backspace
character.
This is most useful when the user's input device does not offer
a backspace facility.
.sp
In addition, the user defineable backspace character has the
function of "hex join" unless "NOHJOIN" is specified.
Thus if the character before the backspace is from "0" to "9",
"A" to "F" or "a" to "f" and the character after the backspace
is in the same range, then the three characters will be replaced
by a single character.
This hex join facility is supported only for the user backspace
character and not the real backspace character X'16', although
the real backspace could be specified as the user's backspace.
.SUBT Defaults
This command will not create a break when encountered.
The initial default user backspace character is not defined.
An omitted character operand will disable the facility.
