.cm SCRIPT REFERENCE IX
.SUBT Purpose
The INDEX control word builds up to 9 index structures with references,
or causes a specified index structure to be printed (or purged).
.SUBT Format
×           <1_×n> 'S1' <'S2' <'S3'>> <<.> <ref>>
×  .IX
×           <1_×n> . <DUMP×PURGE>
.SUBT Usage
.us BUILDING THE INDEX.
In its first form, the .IX control word adds up to three levels of
index entries and a reference entry to an index structure.
If the reference entry is omitted, the current page number will be used
as the reference entry (see Example 1 below).
.sp
If a reference entry other than the current page number is desired and
S3 (or S2 and S3) are to be omitted, then the
control word indicator (normally period)
must be placed
between the index level(s) and the reference operand.
If all four operands are present, the use of the control word indicator
as a separator is optional.
Use of the control word indicator means a reference must follow,
even if null (see Example 4 below).
.sp
.us PRINTING THE INDEX STRUCTURE.
In its second form, the .IX control word with the "DUMP" operand
causes the specified index structure to be printed.  Or, "PURGE"
may be specified to delete the specified index struture.
The index structure will be printed in alpabetic order within levels.
For purposes of alphabetizing the level entries, lower- and upper-case
are considered to be identical.
.sp
Four REMOTEs must
be defined to control how the index levels are to be printed.
These REMOTEs must be defined with the "SAVE NOSAVE" attributes
(see Example 4 below).
.sp
.cp 2;.of 4
(1) Remote SYSIX0 is signalled when the first character of a level
one index changes.  It is signalled with one operand, so that variable
"&1" may be used to access what character is now starting.
.cp 2;.of 4
(2) Remote SYSIX1 is signalled before a level one index.
.cp 2;.of
(3) Remote SYSIX2 is signalled before a level two index.
.cp 2;.of 4
(4) Remote SYSIX3 is signalled before a level three index.
.in +0
.sp
The reference variable "&SYSIXREF." is placed between an index
level and its reference data if reference data is present.
The initial value for this system reference variable is ',
(comma-blank) but may be redefined by the user.
Therefore substitution (.SU) must be turned on when printing
the index.
.SUBT Defaults
This control word does not create a break.
The index number "n" is optional and defaults to one.
No index level operands will be assumed.
A reference of the current page number will be assumed.
.SUBT Examples
.tr ^ .
.of 4;(1) .ix 'level1' 'level2'
.br;adds a first and a second level entry and the current page
number as the reference entry, to index structre 1.
.sp;.of 4;(2) .ix 2 'level1' . 'see...'
.br;adds a first level entry and the reference string "see..." to
index structure 2.
.sp;.of 4;(3) .ix 'level1' . ''
.br;adds a first level entry and a null reference entry to
index structure 1.
.sp;.of 4;(4) The following shows how index structure 1 can be
printed.
