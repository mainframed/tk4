.ur .of &OFN
.ur (&NFN.) This error is commonly caused by presenting an input
line, not intended to be a control line, which begins with a
control indicator, normally a period.
.fn e
.sp
.in
.cp 5
SCRW005E  INVALID CONTROL WORD PARAMETER VALUE.
.in +5
The argument portion of a control line is invalid.  This
could possibly be caused by a character being used where only a
numeric argument is acceptable.
.sp
.in
.cp 5
SCRW006E  OMITTED CONTROL WORD TERMINATION.

SCRW034E  TOO MANY QUEUED LINES FOR .xx.
.in +5
More than the maximum number of lines, as defined by the FNSIZE=
option, are now queued for a ".xx" control word.
Probable cause of this diagnostic is a failure to terminate
with a ".xx
".xx" may be ".CC", ".CP", ".FB", ".FK", ".FN" or ".HN".
.sp
.in
.cp 5
SCRW035E  CONTROL WORD PARAMETER SHOULD BE NUMERIC.
.in +5
