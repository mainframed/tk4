.cm SCRIPT REFERENCE LB
.SUBT Purpose
The LABEL control word specifies an identifier that is to be
associated with the current input record.
.SUBT Format
×
×  .LB           <ident×n>  <line>
×
.SUBT Usage
The .LB control word defines a character identifier
or number to be associated with the current input record.
If the operand is an identifier, then it is converted to upper case
before use.
An identifier may consist of a maximum of eight characters.
If the operand is a number it must be equal to the input
record number.
Thus ".LB five" would be valid anywhere but ".LB 5" would
only be valid on the fifth record of any input file,
macro or remote.
The label operand must be unique within each input file,
macro or remote.
.sp
The optional "line" starting one blank after the operand is
interpreted normally after the label field is scanned.
.sp
The LABEL control word is normally used as a target by the ".GO"
control word.
It may also be used to verify that a statement is
correctly placed in an input file.
.SUBT Defaults
This command does not create a break.
However, control words within the "line" operand
may create a break when the "line" is subsequently interpreted.
If "line" is omitted, no other action is performed.
.SUBT Notes
.of 4
(1) The LABEL ".LB" control word has an alias.
Three occurrences in a row of the control word indicator character,
normally "..." is equivalent.
A blank is not required after the control word in this form.
Thus, ".LB
equivalent.
