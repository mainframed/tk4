.SUBT Usage
The .GO control word defines an identifier
that must match the identifier of a LABEL (.LB) control word
within the current input file.  The identifier is converted
to upper case prior to use and may range from one to eight characters
in length.
Alternatively an absolute record number or signed relative
record number may be specified.
In either case input processing will continue at the specified
record.
.sp
The transfer of control may be forward or backward within the
input file if on a DASD device (Disk) but may only be forward
if on a Unit Record device (Card Reader).
.SUBT Defaults
This command does not create a break.
