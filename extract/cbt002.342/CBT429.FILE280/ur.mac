.cm SCRIPT REFERENCE UR
.SUBT Purpose
The USE REFERENCE control word causes an input line to be reformatted
by substituting the current values of
specified reference names in the line and to be processed as if it
had been in the input.
.SUBT Format
×
×  .UR           line
×
.SUBT Usage
The line which begins one blank after the .UR control word is
reformatted by replacing occurrences of
strings of the form "&name" or "&name(i)" with the current value of
the reference name called "name" or "name(i)".
.sp 1
A reference name instance is denoted by the appearance of a "&"
followed by the name of the
desired reference name followed by a period, a blank or
a special character.  See the ".SR" control word for a list
of special characters.
The variable name "&*" is also valid as a special case.
If the reference symbol scanned
is null, the ampersand is left unchanged in the string.
The current value of the reference name is
converted (if necessary) to a character string and substituted for
the string "&name." (if a period
is used for delimiting) or the string "&name" (if a blank
or special character is used).
.sp 1
Certain implied subscripts for reference names are also supported.
An implied subscript of "A(*)" concatenates all the entries of that
reference name together, from "A(-32767)" to "A(+32767)" except
"A(0)", each separated by a comma and blank ", ".
Similarly "A(*-)" refers to the concatenation of all negative
subscript elements of "A" and "A(*+)" refers to all positive
subscript elements of "A".
.sp
Substring facilities on variables are supported by
specifying a start column and an end column separated by
a colon ":" following or instead of a subscript.
Thus "C(j:k)" refers to columns "j" to "k" of variable "C",
and "V(i,j:k)" refers to columns "j" to "k" of variable "V(i)".
The value of "j" may not be omitted but "k" may be omitted
as it defaults to the end of the variable.
Substring operations outside the length of the variable
return null.
.sp
Substring facilities on variables are also supported by
specifying a start column and a length separated by an "or
Thus "C(j×k)" refers to column "j" for length "k" of variable "C",
and "V(i,j×k)" refers to column "j" for length "k" of variable
"V(i)".
The value "j" may not be omitted, but "k" may be omitted as it defaults
to the end of the variable.
.sp
The line thus constructed is processed as if it had been in the
original input stream.
.SUBT Defaults
The ".ur" control word does not act as
a break itself.  However, control words within the "line" may
create a break when the line is
reinterpreted after substituting symbolic references with their
values.
If "line" is omitted or becomes null after substitution
then no action is performed.
.SUBT Notes

(1) See the description of the .SR control word for additional
information.

.cp 5
(2) If reference names appearing in the line have not yet been
assigned a value via .SR, a null character string
value will be assumed.  Note, however, the effect of the "TWOPASS"
option previously described.

.cp 2
(3) Text &'s in a .UR line are indicated by "&&" or
"&" followed by a special character.  Only one "&"
appears in the reformatted line.
.of 4
.cp 3
(4) Negative values are allowed for numeric reference names and
result in a signed integer suitable
for use with the .SR control word.
.of 4
(5) The TAB character is _n_o_t a blank.
.of 4
(6) If the variable string is preceeded by an "L'" then the
"L'" and the variable will be the Length of that variable.
For a numeric variable the length is the number of characters
to format the number including a sign if negative.
.of 4
(7) If the variable string is preceeded by a "T'" then the
"T'" and the variable will be replaced by the Type of that variable.
For a character variable a 'C' is returned and for a numeric variable
a 'N' is returned.

their formats and meanings.
