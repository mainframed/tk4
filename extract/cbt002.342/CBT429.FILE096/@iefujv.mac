 The IEFUJV exit supplied will perform symbolic substitution in JCL
 prior to conversion.  Each non-comment JCL card image will be scanned
 for special tokens, and the tokens will be replaced with values as
 follows:
    TOKEN      VALUE
    -----      -----
    ?SYSXAMODE "XA" if system is in XA mode, "" (null string) otherwise
    ?SYSSPLV   "1" if system is 370 mode, "2" if xa mode
    ?SYSSMF    4-character system SMF id (from SMCA)
    ?SYSID     last character of system SMF id
    ?SYSTSO    translation of "?SYSID" (A->H, B->I, C->J, other->#)
    ?SYSZONE   translation of "?SYSID" (A->B, B->B, C->A, other->#)
    ?SYSSUBA   Host VTAM subarea (2-digit number with leading 0's)
    ?SYSYEAR   Current year (YYYY)
    ?SYSDATE   Current date (YYMMDD)
    ?SYSYY     Current year (YY)
    ?SYSMM     Current month (MM)
    ?SYSDD     Current day of the month (DD)
    ?SYSJDATE  Current date in julian (YYDDD)
    ?SYSWD     Current day of week (1-7, 1=Sunday)
    ?SYSWKDY   Current day of week (SUN, MON, TUE, WED, THU, or FRI)
    ?SYSMONTH  Current month (JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG,
               SEP, OCT, NOV, or DEC)

 These tokens can be used either in instream JCL or in (instream or
 library) PROCedures, however, if a token is included as a value or
 part of a value for symbolic substitution in an EXEC PROC statement,
 the value MUST be enclosed in tic marks, e.g.:
     //  EXEC  MYPROC,SYS=?SYSSMF      is invalid, but
     //  EXEC  MYPROC,SYS='?SYSSMF'    will work.

 Two values are used to determine the tokens to be substituted:
 assembly global &KWDCHAR is set to the initial character, which
 must be the same for all tokens.  I chose "?" as it is not normally
 encountered in JCL.  The remainder of the tokens are defined at
 label KWDTAB by means of the KEYWORD macro.  The syntax of this
 macro is:
        KEYWORD  token,label,dsect
 where "token" is the complete token, "label" is the address of a
 data area which contains the replacement value, and "dsect" is the
 name of the control block which contains data area "label."
 The table is terminated by the following (which is required):
        KEYWORD  END-OF-TABLE

 If you wish to change the list of tokens to be replaced, you should:
   1) Add any required data fields to the SYSAREA DSECT.
   2) Add logic to initialize these data fields following label VTAM020.
   3) Add/remove any required entries in the table following label
      KWDTAB.  This table is in order by token length, longest first.
      This order is necessary if any token is a substring of any
      other token (e.g., "?ABC" and "?ABCDE") - if the shorter token
      precedes the longer in the table, the longer will never be
      found.  Be sure the keyword table is terminated with a
      KEYWORD END-OF-TABLE macro call.
