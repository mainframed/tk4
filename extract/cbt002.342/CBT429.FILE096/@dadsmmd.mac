   REQUIRED - PROTECT, NOPROTECT, HSMPROTECT, NOHSMPROTECT, or ZAPVOL.
              VOLUMES is required if ZAPVOL is specified.
              At least one of NEWVOLUMES, MIGVOL, NOMIGVOL, UIDCK,
              NOUIDCK, GLOBALCK, NOGLOBALCK, TEMPDS, or NOTEMPDS
              is required if ZAPVOL is specified.

   NOTE:      VOLUMES, NEWVOLUMES, MIGVOL, NOMIGVOL, UIDCK, NOUIDCK,
              GLOBALCK, NOGLOBALCK, TEMPDS, and NOTEMPDS are valid
              only if ZAPVOL is specified; they will be ignored
              otherwise.

              In addition to the normal TSO short forms, the following
              abbreviations are recognized:
                 VOLUMES      - VOLSERS
                 NEWVOLUMES   - NVOLUMES, NVOLSERS, NV
                 NOMIGVOL     - NM
                 NOUIDCK      - NU, NORACHECK, NORACF, NR
                 UIDCK        - RACHECK, RACF
                 NOGLOBALCK   - NG
                 NOTEMPDS     - NT
)O OPERANDS -
)P         "function" - Specify the desired function to be
            performed.  Value may be any one of the following:
  PROTECT - Turn on DADSM protection for all volumes as defined in
            the existing parms.  This is a reversal of the NOPROTECT
            function.
  NOPROTECT - turn off DADSM protection for all volumes without
            otherwise changing the existing volume protection list.
            In addition to the normal TSO abbreviations, any valid
            abbreviation of any of the following may be used:
            NPROTECT
  HSMPROTECT - Disallow HSM access to any RACF-protected volume, and
            enforce prefix restrictions to HSM, on all volumes not
            defined as HSM migration volumes.  This is a reversal
            of the NOHSMPROTECT function.
            In addition to the normal TSO abbreviations, any valid
            abbreviation of any of the following may be used:
            HPROTECT
  NOHSMPROTECT - Allow HSM to perform any function on any volume,
            whether or not that volume is defined as a MIGVOL.
            In addition to the normal TSO abbreviations, any valid
            abbreviation of any of the following may be used:
            NHSMPROTECT, NOHPROTECT, NHPROTECT
  DEBUG   - Turn debug mode on for all DADSM functions.
  NODEBUG - Turn debug mode off for all DADSM functions.
            In addition to the normal TSO abbreviations, any valid
            abbreviation of any of the following may be used:
            NDEBUG
  ZAPVOL  - Change the attributes of one or a list of volume serial
            numbers.
))VOLUMES(old-volser-list) - Supplies a list of volume serials whose
            protection attributes are to be ZAPped.
  old-volser-list - a list of volume serial numbers, separated by
            commas, whose volume protection attributes are to be
            ZAPped.  Each volume serial in the list must exist.
))NEWVOLUMES(new-volser-list) - Supplies a list of new volume serial
            numbers.  Each volume serial number in the VOLUMES list
            will be changed to the number in the corresponding
            position in the NEWVOLUMES list.  Entries which are not
            to be renamed should be signified by an "*" in the
            corresponding position in the NEWVOLUMES list.
  new-volser-list - the list of new volume serial numbers and/or
            asterisks ("*").  This list must have exactly the same
            number of entries as the VOLUMES list.
))MIGVOL  - Specifies that all volumes in the VOLUMES list should have
            the MIGVOL attribute set in their volume protection profile.
))NOMIGVOL - Specifies that all volumes in the VOLUMES list should have
            the MIGVOL attribute removed from their volume protection
            profile.
))UIDCK   - Specifies that all volumes in the VOLUMES list should have
            the "RACF-check" attribute turned on in their volume
            protection profile.
))NOUIDCK - Specifies that all volumes in the VOLUMES list should have
            the "RACF-check" attribute turned off in their volume
            protection profile.
))GLOBALCK - Specifies that all volumes in the VOLUMES list should have
            the "also check GLOBAL restrictions" attribute turned on
            in their volume protection profile.
))NOGLOBALCK - Specifies that all volumes in the VOLUMES list should
            have the "also check GLOBAL restrictions" attribute turned
            off in their volume protection profile.
))TEMPDS  - Specifies that all volumes in the VOLUMES list should have
            the "allow temporary dataset allocations" attribute turned
            on in their volume protection profile.
))NOTEMPDS - Specifies that all volumes in the VOLUMES list should have
            the "allow temporary dataset allocations" attribute turned
            off in their volume protection profile.
