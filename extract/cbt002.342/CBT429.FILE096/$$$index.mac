 The following utilities are included in this dataset:

           ***** DASD ALLOCATION/RENAME CONTROL *****

   HCCDADSM - exit to restrict dasd dataset allocations by dsname,
              volume, and user RACF authority.
   IGGPRE00 - dadsm exit to conditionally link to HCCDADSM only if
              it is present.
   INIDADSM - program to process parameters and setup HCCDADSM
              control block (DADSMBLK)
   INITNCT  - program to build user cvt (we call this control block
              the network control table or NCT) and place its address
              in the cvtuser field.  This control block is used as
              the anchor for the DADSMBLK above.
              *NOTE* This program must run APF-AUTHORIZED.
   IPLDATE  - TSO cp to extract and format the last IPL date and time
              from the NCT (since the NCT is created fairly late
              in the IPL, this is a better approximation of the
              actual "system available" date and time than that
              in the SMCA).
   DADSMMOD - TSO cp to allow authorized users to temporarily modify
              dadsm protection attributes in DADSMBLK.
              *NOTE* This must run as an APF-AUTHORIZED TSO CP.
   @DADSMMD - TSO help for DADSMMOD command.
   @INIDASD - sample initialization parameters for INIDADSM above.
   @DADSM   - sample JCL for DADSM started task to set up DADSMBLK.
   @INITSYS - sample JCL for INITSYS started task to set up NCT.
   @NCTDOC  - general comments about the NCT, when/how it is created,
              etc.

                   ***** RETURN CODE CHECKER *****

   HCCRCCK  - program to force an abend on a bad return code, allowing
              conditional DISP to be taken for data sets.
              *NOTE* This program must run APF-AUTHORIZED.
   ATTCHATH - ATTACH/REAUTH subroutine used by HCCRCCK.
   @HCCRCCK - sample JCL for executing the HCCRCCK program.

              ***** JES2 CHECKPOINT PERFORMANCE MONITOR ****

   HJUX2530 - sample JES exit 253 to cut SMF records for JES2
              checkpoint performance monitoring.
   TSJESSMF - PL/1 program to reduce and analyze SMF records
              produced by HJUX2530 above.
   PDUMP    - Subroutine for TSJESSMF (PL/1 data area formatted dump)
   @JESSMF  - sample JCL to execute the TSJESSMF program.
   @JESPARM - sample JES2 initialization parameters for HJUX2530.
   @JESCKPT - various stuff about JES2 checkpoint processing

              ***** JCL PRESCAN AND REPLACEMENT ****

   IEFUJV   - SMF exit to scan and conditionally replace certain
              symbolic parameters in JCL prior to conversion
              (e.g., host name, day of week, date, etc. can be
              placed in appropriate places in your JCL prior to
              conversion).
   @IEFUJV  - instructions for using iefujv module as shipped.

              ***** VARIOUS PL/1 STUFF ****

   PLIARRV  - Macro to generate PL/1 standard entry point to assembly
              language subroutines.
   PLIRETN  - Macro to generate PL/1 standard return sequence for
              assembly language subroutines.
   DSAD     - Macro to generate a DSECT describing the PL/1 dynamic
              storage area (DSA).
   TRIM     - Assembly language subroutine to chop leading and trailing
              blanks from a character string.
   FINDCHR  - Assembly language subroutine to locate the first character
              in a string matching any character in an index string.

              ***** SMP/E SUPPORT FOR ABOVE FUNCTIONS ****

   MDL0101  - SMP/E USERMOD to install HCCDADSM/IGGPRE00 into your
              (MVS/SP 1.3.6) system.
   MDL0103  - SMP/E USERMOD to install HCCDADSM/IGGPRE00 into your
              (MVS/SP 2.2) system.
   MJL1401  - SMP/E USERMOD to install exit points for exit 253 into
              your JES2 (1.3.6) HASPCKPT module.
   MJL1501  - SMP/E USERMOD to add knowledge of HJUX2530 (exit 253)
              to your JES2 (1.3.6) system.
   MSL0101  - SMP/E USERMOD to add knowledge of IEFUJV into your
              MVS (1.3.6) system.
   MSL0103  - SMP/E USERMOD to add knowledge of IEFUJV into your
              MVS (2.2) system.
