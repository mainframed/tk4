  The NCT or Network Control Table was originally (many, many years
  ago) set up to support our security system and some TCAM applications.
  Since that time we have turned to RACF instead of our home-grown
  security system, and TCAM is no longer supported at our installation.
  The NCT, however, is still utilized by several of our system mods,
  for example, our TSO logon preprompt exit IKJEFLD, DADSM exit
  IGGPRE00, and by some other system functions.  It is a handy place
  to anchor various common-area control blocks, and has also allowed
  us to dynamically change certain exit functions.  For example, by
  creating only a "stub" with the name ICHPWX01 (which "stub" issues
  a BALR or BASSM to an address contained in the NCT) the RACF password
  exit can be dynamically changed without an IPL by 1) placing a new
  copy of the exit in the common area then 2) refreshing the address in
  the NCT.  We have successfully used this technique with several
  exits (IKJEFLD, IGGPRE00, ICHPWX01, etc.)
