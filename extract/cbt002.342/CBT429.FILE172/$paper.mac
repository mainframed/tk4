- This paper describes the work done at the Sprecher Energie computer ce
  in Switzerland to make MVS/XA use the 3990-3 Extended Functions for pa
  operations in an environment without Expanded Storage. The problems of
  measuring the performance of the 3990-3 are described. A simple perfor
  monitor program was written, showing that paging does not use the 3990
  Extended Functions. The changes to MVS/XA required to overcome this, a
  results obtained, form the rest of the text.

0 Sprecher Energie AG is part of the Joint Venture between the French gr
  Alsthom, and GEC of Great Britain. We use the renowned engineering ski
  the Swiss in the construction of high voltage switchgear, the sort of
  to be seen outside power stations.
0 The computer centre at the company headquarters in Oberentfelden Switz
  houses an IBM 4381 model 24 running MVS/XA 2.2 and CICS 2.1.1 to drive
  online applications critical to production planning. Online response t
  of paramount importance because the whole company revolves around thes
  systems. We are always seeking new ways to improve response time. Budg
  constraints have prevented us from upgrading the machine - anyway, at
  time where could we go from the top of the range 4381? Water cooling w
  be very expensive. That meant that Expanded Storage was not available
  and that MVS/ESA is at best a 'Long Term Consideration'.

0 We installed a 3390-3 J03 (64Mb) in May 1989 after a study by IBM conv
  us that it would give faster response times than the Solid State disks
  installed at that time. Indeed it did, the improvement was dramatic.
  Furthermore, it did not require constant tuning to ensure that the dev
  was used to the optimum benefit; the box seemed to be self regulating.
  installed DFP 2.4 in May 1990, one year later. We immediately enabled
  3990-3 Extended Functions, DASD Fast Write and Cache Fast Write.
  Unfortunately this upgrade did not bring us faster response times. Wha
  did bring was some much needed relief in the Batch window - one overni
  system came down from 12 hours to 7 hours. This was gratifying, but we
  really wanted to know why online response had not improved as much as
  hoped. We found it was very difficult to know what was going on.

+      __________ _____
0 IBM had obtained for us a copy of a paper entitled 'IBM 3990 Extended
  Function' written by Daniel Asselin from the IBM ITSC in Santa Teresa.
  is an excellent and comprehensive Beginners Guide to the box. In it ar
  very good notes on the IBM Cache RMF Reporter (CRR) program, 5798-DQD.
  appeared at that time to be about the only product available which cou
  meaningful information about cache performance. The alternative was to
  the LISTDATA functions of IDCAMS, but this only gives the total values
  all the counters. To get useful information you have to do an awful lo
  arithmetic. However, Asselin shows how to do this, and we tried it a c
  of times. It was interesting, but we still did not know what it was te
  us. It was a lot of effort to get not much information. We were lookin
  ways to get not much information for not much effort. We considered bu
  the CRR product from IBM, but it seemed to go for the overkill approac
  really were not terribly interested in Cache Write Hit Ratios, or the
  Sequential Read/Write Ratio or all these other technical terms. There
  not much we could do about them anyway because there are no buttons to
  on the box to tune it, all you can do is move data around. That is an
  extremely tedious business predicated on the User having a surplus of
  space to play around with. The CRR product, cheap though it may be, di
  seem to us to be a cost effective way of spending our limited budget.
  we wanted was some way to get a quick overview of cache activity so th
  could spot discrepancies without all that technical stuff, and it look
  like we would have to Roll Our Own.
0 An obvious approach was to post-process an IDCAMS LISTDATA report.  Wh
  looking at this possibility we needed clarification of what exactly th
  counters were telling us, so we went to the definitive document, 'IBM
  Storage Control Reference', GA32-0099. From this excellent manual we f
  the way that IDCAMS gets its data. On receipt of a valid channel comma
  'READ SUBSYSTEM DATA', command code X'3E', the controller returns the
  statistics record for one or all the devices attached to the controlle
  format of the statistics record for a device is shown in Figure 1. The
  an awful lot of detailed data here.
0 Armed with this information it was fairly easy to write a program to r
  the statistics records for all devices directly from the 3990. It seem
  complicated to write it as an RMF User module like CRR, but the idea o
  having it synchronised with RMF seemed reasonable. We settled for a
  compromise of reporting on the same time boundaries as RMF, in our cas
  minutes.  It was obviously a good idea to write the statistics record
  part of a User SMF record for post processing, so we copied CRR in tha
  well. However, we also wanted real time information, so we added a
  multi-line WTO to show the Efficiency of cache for each device. Asseli
  illustrates the efficiency of the 3990 by calculating the percentage o
  physical I/O's to requests. We defined Efficiency as 100 minus that fi
  in other words the percentage of I/O's dealt with entirely in cache. A
  typical report can be seen in Figure 2. A matrix of 64 possible device
  presented in rows of eights, with a dual heading. The User has to be c
  that he is looking at the device number he thinks he is, but it gives
  and compact display.
0 This program gave immediate benefits. We could see devices which seeme
  candidates for cache, as well as those which are not. The most efficie

- of cache turns out to be WORK disks - the reason for that is that the
  user of work space is SORT, and DF/SORT uses Cache Fast Write, so very
  requests result in physical I/O. Another surprise was that SYSRES also
  good use of cache. We use the Legent product QUICK-FETCH to buffer lin
  so did not expect much activity on SYSRES. What we forgot were the ISP
  panel libraries, CLIST libraries, CSP files and other non-load library
  activity. The biggest shock was that the Efficiency of cache for page
  volumes was zero - they did not use cache at all. It did not seem a go
  idea to hang page volumes under cache if they were never going to use
  we reconfigured the machine to move those page volumes off to a 3880 a
  replaced them with TEST disks. Nobody cared about test response time,
  least they would use cache if it was available. By getting as much Use
  as possible under cache we implimented a long standing IBM recommendat
  have a dedicated string for paging. Let me tell you, it does work. Res
  times improved - not dramatically, but it made us feel good.
0 This was all well and good, but the display from our Simple Software C
  Reporter lacked something. It was no good worrying about a disk with l
  cache Efficiency if it only had one or two I/O's in a quarter hour.
  Similarly a high percentage of a low number of I/O's is still only a s
  benefit. What was needed was some idea of the number of I/O's per devi
  we added to the display the percentage of the total I/O's to the 3990
  controller which were aimed at each volume. Figure 3 shows the result.
  display has since been slightly enhanced at the suggestion of ATAG
  Informatik to include read, write and total I/O counts. We never have
  any post processing of the SMF records, but they are available if we g
  deeply involved in Read/Write ratios or other advanced calculations.

  4.   PAGING WITH CACHE
+ 4.   PAGING WITH CACHE
+      ______ ____ _____
0 We were intrigued as to why IBM did not make MVS/XA use cache for pagi
  seemed such a good application for 3990-3 Extended Functions which cou
  guarantee the integrity of the data with greatly reduced I/O time. Sur
  was wrong to suspect that the only reasons could be commercial ones to
  with the sales of main or expanded storage? We asked our SE, who came
  with the reply that the application did not suit the cache management
  algorithms. We were so impressed with the benefits we got from the 399
  commercial applications that we thought it might be worth trying anywa
  had already seen that the Cache Efficiency of page volumes was zero, s
  looked into the reasons for this. They were not hard to find, a GTF tr
  channel programs to a page volume showed that they all began with a De
  Extent command, hex code '63', specifying BYPASS CACHE. We wanted to c
  that Define Extent. Logically we should just zap off the BYPASS CACHE
  the default for the 3990 is to use DASD Fast Write. However, we were n
  that fussed about the integrity of paging - if the cache took a hit we
  allow some System 028 abends, or even an IPL, provided it did not happ
  frequently. Our 3990 has not been as reliable as we would like, but we
  never lost any data because of its problems and we thought it might be
  reasonable risk. The gain would be that we could use Cache Fast Write,
  offloading the Non-Volatile Storage and possibly giving faster respons
  times.

- This turns out to be more complex than we thought. It is not just a qu
  of zapping a bit in the Define Extent. Every Channel Program using Cac
  Fast Write has to supply a Cache Identifier which matches that current
  use by the box. If cache is re-initialized, maybe after a failure, thi
  identifier is incremented, and Channel Programs with the old Identifie
  terminated with a Unit Check. Therefore we could not just zap MVS modu
  and re-IPL, because the next time we powered the box off our paging
  sub-system would be inoperative. The CCW's have to be changed dynamica
  using the current Cache Fast Write Identifier. This should not change
  the life of an IPL, but certainly will change over a long period. It w
  be enough to zap the modules in storage once per IPL. We had already w
  a monitor program to read data from the 3990, so it was not difficul t
  modify that code to read the Cache Fast Write Identifier. All we had t
  now was to find out what to do with it.
0 From the System Logic Library for MVS/XA we were able to deduce that o
  the modules involved may be ILRCPBLD. The name was hopeful, anyway. If
  browse through that module you will find near the end the hex string
  X'00C410000000'. These are the Define Extent Attribute Bytes specifyin
  BYPASS CACHE. We modified our 3990 interrogation program to look up th
  address of ILRCPBLD in the Nucleus Map Table, then go search the modul
  this hex string. When found, the program overwrites it with X'00C21000
  followed by the two byte Cache Fast Write Identifier read from the box
  says 'Use Cache Fast Write, and here is the Identifier'. As the module
  Page Protected you have to be pretty tricky to modify it, but IBM in i
  infinite wisdom provides a way to do this if you look hard enough. Nat
  we also wrote a version of the program to restore the IBM default so t
  could do planned maintenance on cache. Another version zaps in Attribu
  Bytes X'00C010000000', which allows DASD Fast Write. This could probab
  permanently zapped in without risk.
0 Came the great day (or rather night, we are not that foolhardy). ZAPPO
  Well, at least the machine was still running, so we seemed to have got
  something right. After a fifteen minute wait out came the Cache Statis
  They were extremely disappointing. The cached disk with a Page Dataset
  defined on it had only 1% of I/O's and Cache Efficiency was less than
  This was not going to deliver the instant response we had hoped for, c
  IBM just possibly have been right? Another GTF trace showed that only
  Channel Programs had the new Define Extent Attributes, so although the
  working the effects would be entirely negated by the BYPASS CACHE comm
  causing destaging before reading the data back. Another look through t

  logic manual and we added a zap of ILRSWAP to the program. This was be
  but we still had some Channel Programs with BYPASS CACHE, which would
  seriously damaging to Cache Efficiency. ILRPGFLT was finally identifie
  the culprit - why have one module build Channel Programs when IBM can
  in three?  Anyway, at last we were paging directly into cache.
0 Yes Folks, IBM was right after all. The Efficiency was dreadful, rarel
  hitting 20%. A big surprise was that paging only accounts for 1 or 2 p
  of all I/O's. We thought this may be why the cache management algorith
  make such a bad job of it. Response times were no better, possibly the
  worse because they were more variable depending on other activity on t
  machine. It looked like a dedicated string for paging was the optimum
  architecture. It was only when we attended Bill Thompson's presentatio
  Non-Synchronous DASD at the European G.U.I.D.E. Conference in Wiesbade

- we found out that the real reason that paging is not an efficient cach
  application is because MVS uses Head Switching channel programs to opt
  slot placement.

  5.   SWAPPING
+ 5.   SWAPPING
+      ________
0 We were deeply unhappy that it had ended that way, but could not see w
  do about it. Thinking about it, we figured maybe the problem was becau
  allowed the Auxiliary Storage Manager to mix Paging and Swapping on th
  page datasets. Maybe this was causing poor cache management by swampin
  Demand Paging with Swap Sets and vice versa. We thought that the best
  candidate of the two would be Swapping because that generates large vo
  of contiguous data - well suited to cache management. We tried this, a
  results were very encouraging. Cache Efficiency for a Swap Dataset see
  be between 20 and 50 percent, although the amount of I/O was small. It
  probably be beneficial to us to separate paging and swapping anyway be
  of our mix of CICS and TSO. By using Cache Fast Write for swapping we
  allocate Swap Datasets to ordinary, non-dedicated volumes. We may get
  a lot of destaging by the cache management algorithms, but this is hap
  asynchronously with the swapping I/O, so is not a problem. Swap Sets w
  be promoted into cache as soon as referenced anyway, so we get some be
  from cache reads as well as the speed advantage of writing directly in
  cache. Because we can use non-dedicated disks we could allocate enough
  Datasets to maximise overlapping of swap I/O, in our case we defined t
  Swap Datasets of ten cylinders each. As we had now moved all our TEST
  under cache we were able to use those volumes. Although the figures sh
  that this was not using cache terribly efficiently, the gain in actual
  response times made it worthwhile to do this, and we ran like this for
  long time. We concluded that response times had improved from studying
  and NETSPY graphs. We therefore tuned the system to take advantage of
  new characteristics, for example by lowering UIC thresholds and by red
  Logical Swap Think Time. These measures were intended to maximise the
  utilisation of real storage by using the faster swap capability of the
  3990-3. In turn they increased the Cache Efficiency for the Swap Datas
  between 50 and 80 percent. Before examining the performance of cache f
  swapping more closely, we should consider the System Availability prob

0 As explained, we felt able to risk a few problems in return for better
  performance,but it was not long before we found out what we had let
  ourselves in for. Figure 4 shows a the sort of thing we began to find
  SYSLOG. Message IEA459I seemed so innocuous, but was a harbinger of do
  The first time this happened was during Prime Shift, so everybody pani
  CICS was still running, having been defined as non-swappable, but ever
  else seemed to have crashed. We therefore did an IPL over the lunch br
  when not many people would notice (the whole of Switzerland closes for
  - even some restaurants). The next time it happened was during the eve
  so guess what happened. Our Operators (God bless 'em) just kept restar
  all those darned Initiators. After every Swap Set on every Swap Datase

  only Local Page Datasets.  The system still ran fine.

0 This scenario occurred several times, mostly overnight. It was annoyin
  not fatal. Of course, we wanted to schedule an IPL as soon as possible
  that to be able to swap into cache again, but it could take as long as
  weeks before the schedule allowed an IPL. In order to reduce the time
  to recover from the dreaded IEA459I we shrank the Swap Datasets to fiv
  cylinders each, and eventually we wrote an MPF exit  to disable our ch
  as soon as this message was detected. Hopefully that way only one or t
  address spaces would get killed. This was going a bit far from our Kee
  Simple philosophy, but all of the code was lying around anyway and jus
  needed to be stitched together in a new way.
0 Having done all this work to protect ourselves from IEA459I, what happ
  IBM did an EC change on the microcode and we began to get failures wit
  IEA459I as shown in Figure 5. We tried to APAR this,saying that if cac
  re-initiated it should issue the message to say it has been re-initiat
  but IBM came back and said that IEA459I was driven by Sense Bytes and
  did not get the right combination of bits it would not issue IEA459I.

0 Although we could satisfy ourselves that cache swapping had improved
  response times, this was based more on the hands-on feel of the system
  on some graphs which were open to various interpretations. For a wider
  audience we needed better hard numbers.
0 There is a chapter in the MVS/XA Initialisation and Tuning Guide
  which deals with 'The Use of GTF to Track Sysevents'. At the end of th
  chapter are some illustrations of the sort of reports which may be pro
  including an example of the 'Distribution of Time Needed to Complete a
  Swapout'. This looked like exactly what we wanted - we could run such
  report against various configurations to compare them. We asked IBM if
  program to produce this report was available. IBM were as helpful as e
  so we had to do it ourselves. Fortunately we had a copy of a Sysevent

  contributed to the Public Domain. Our grateful thanks to them for thei
  public spirit. These programs were fairly easy to modify for MVS/XA an
  provided the foundation for our measurements, fitting in nicely with o
  'Keep It Simple' philosophy and yet being accurate to within one micro
  - if you are like us and confused between micro- and milli-, that is t
  the minus six, one millionth. This is the Timer resolution on a 4381.
0 We quickly realised that a much more interesting measure was the
  Distribution of Time Needed to Complete a Swap-IN, because the concept
  Logical Swap means that Swap-Out times do not actually tell you much.
  TSO User may or may not get swapped out to disk, but what determines h
  perception of response time is how long it takes to get him swapped ba
  Hopefully with a Logical Swap this will not be a long time, but if he
  physically swapped then the performance of the swap mechanism will bec
  important. We therefore measured the time between the SWINSTAT Syseven
  code 10 sub-type 1  - page frames acquired - and sub-type 2, Swap-in
  complete. This should be a measure of the I/O time for a physical Swap
  Figure 6 shows the distribution of Swap-In times for various configura
  The IBM recommendation of using only Local Page Datasets on a dedicate
  string gives the worst performance. For our combination of TSO, Batch
  CICS the addition of Swap Datasets on non-dedicated disks moves the av
  I/O time down about 30 milliseconds. If we add cache the improvement i
  dramatic, many more swaps completing much faster. The difference betwe
  Cache Fast Write and DASD Fast write is nothing compared to the overal
  improvement, indeed DASD Fast Write provides slightly better Swap-in
  performance. This may be because data takes slightly longer to process
  cache, so the chance of a Read Hit is higher.
0 We still have some interest in Swap-out times however, because faster
  Swapouts will free up real storage frames that much quicker. If we loo
  our version of the Distribution of Time Needed To Complete a Swapout s
  in Figure 7 we can again see that cache gives tremendous benefit. The
  difference between Local versus Swap Datasets is less clear, and this
  Cache Fast Write is faster than DASD Fast Write, which is what we expe
  in the first place. However, the difference in performance between the
  cache operations is not as great as we first thought. Indeed, one can
  good case for DASD Fast Write giving the better overall gain with much
  risk, so we have now changed to using only DASD Fast Write for Swap
  Datasets.
0 These figures agree with our perception that the system is much more
  responsive. TSO response time is better and Batch throughput is higher
  SRM copes with transient overloads much more effectively as the swappi
  sub-system is speeded up. We can now encourage swapping because it doe
  represent a bottleneck in our system, which can happily run at average
  paging rates of 200 per second with instantaneous peaks up to 450 page
  second, or higher. Remember, this is a 4381, 8 MIPS with no expanded
  storage. Using the Sysevent Analysis System to analyze Think Time, we
  that setting the Logical Think Time threshold to 4 seconds, plus 2 sec
  grace from MVS, made 80 percent of Swaps into Logical Swaps. Extending
  Logical Think Time beyond this value was not cost effective, so that's
  we used. This in turn meant that Started Tasks were no longer eligible
  Logical Swap, so we had to make a couple of them non-swappable, but ou
  storage frame availability improved dramatically. CICS response time a

- improved because fewer pages were being stolen, and the MVS overhead w
  down because of less demand paging.  With less overhead TSO response t
  improved, even though we were now doing much more swapping.

0 Users of MVS/ESA will have to judge for themselves the applicability o
  work to their environment. It seems reasonable to assume that the same
  modules perform the same functions in MVS/ESA, so the code changes wil
  probably work. The ability to dynamically remove page datasets may mak
  option of using Cache Fast Write more interesting, or else you could
  probably get the same benefits by doing a SYSMOD to permanently zap ou
  BYPASS CACHE bit in ILRSWAP. Whether it will be more cost effective to
  perform a two stage Swapout via expanded storage, or a single stage Sw
  to 3990-3 cache is an interesting exercise that we will have to leave
  someone else, because it seems likely that we will downsize to VSE/ESA
