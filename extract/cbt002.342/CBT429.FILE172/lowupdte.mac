                                  LOWUPDTE

  I was once given the task of installing maintenance on the 'MICS'
  product from LEGENT, now CA.  Some of the sample JCL provided has
  parameters in lower case, the intention being that you will tailor
  such things as High Level Qualifiers to your own installation's
  standards. Much of this tailoring is done by the jobstreams generated
  by the MICS Administrator Facility dialogs, and it is crucially
  important to follow the MICS Checklists very carefully.  However, I
  found for example that the jobs in the sharedprefix.PSP.CNTL dataset
  were not tailored and had to be individually edited to local
  standards.

  The 'IPOUPDTE' program from IBM has been used for many years to
  customise the batch CBIPO installation jobstreams. For almost as many
  years people have zapped it to allow its use on non-IBM libraries and
  I tried to use such a version on the MICS libraries. I was confused
  when IPOUPDTE reported that the string 'SHAREDPREFIX' was not found in
  the library.  I then dimly recalled that IPOUPDTE will translate input
  to upper case, so my text would indeed not be found. Doing a hex
  browse of the load module showed what looked like translate tables, so
  I worked up a zap to translate lower case characters back to
  themselves rather than to their upper case big brothers.  When I tried
  this I was indeed able to change 'sharedprefix' to 'MICS' in every
  member of MICS.PSP.CNTL and so save myself a lot of work and JCL
  errors.

  The job shown will create a renamed copy of IPOUPDTE in a private load
  library and will apply two zaps. One is the standard BLDL bypass from
  the Public Domain. The other will allow the program to process lower
  case input.
