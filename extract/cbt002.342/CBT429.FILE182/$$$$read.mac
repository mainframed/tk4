    The adventure starts here.   Armed with only your imagination and
    the source to PDS you are ready to do battle within the labyrinth
    of the IBM partitioned data set structure.  In the past, the PDS
    kit was just a handy dagger at your side; but by now, it has grown
    into a fully armed battle wagon to carry you on your everyday
    travels.   There is plenty of room for lots of provisions as well
    as extra tools and weapons.  The Weapon Masters have been busy
    these past few years so you will need to put some effort into
    discovering the use of the new armament to gain the full benefit
    of their work.  Do not assume you know the steps for outfitting a
    new PDS or that your old plans are sufficient.

    Start planning your home base by reading the instructions in member
    $$$INST.  DO NOT OVERLOOK any of the hidden passageways.  BE SURE TO
    READ $$$CTBL and carefully read through the member #PDSGEN for basic
    customization options.  #PDSGENB contains additional options and you
    may also want to use the optional member #PDSGENU.  Also, you may
    need to update your skills with the latest tactics by reading member
    $$$MODS.  As an added bonus, we have added some EDIT macros; see
    members $$$CUT and $$$EQUAL.  Also READ $$$TRAP.

    Next, you need to choose your weapons.  The #PDSGEN member lists
    the various utility programs that PDS can attach.  Several of these
    weapons are designed to interface with PDS (the utilities from CBT
    file 296 and VTOC from CBT file 112).  In #PDSGEN, there are also
    directions to adjust for the terrain (system) you will be exploring.

    Included with your kit is a selection of battle manuals and road
    maps.  The members $PDSART0-3 give the strategic information you
    need and member $$$PROSE gives good examples of battle maneuvers.
    For a map of all paths through PDS the HELP member is your key;
    to create a copy of the HELP to carry with you, use the HELPLIST
    program.  ISPF tutorial and selection panels are close at hand
    for use in the heat of battle.

    You will want to make your battle wagon fit for long campaigns.
    For this, customize it for use in your own kingdom.  Besides the
    basic adjustments you make in #PDSGEN, you can modify several
    panels.  These panels provide for attaching tools of your own
    design.  You can create CLIST/DIALOGS that interface with any
    number of magical things.  READ member $$$CUSTM to see how.
    Also, adjustments can be made on the move using the set default
    services provided in ISPF mode as well as with the CONTROL
    command.

    Be brave and explore your new powers born of the PDS command.
    Make new friends and allies on your travels and teach them the
    secrets you have learned in the labyrinth using PDS.
    And may fortune be with you in the land of MVS.
