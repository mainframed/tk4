%Alias check:+
   A CHANGE subcommand or a MEMLIST subcommand with the RESET keyword
   causes any existing member list to be discarded.  When a new member
   list is created,÷PDS+can perform an automatic alias check.

   Part of the processing that is performed in an automatic alias check
   includes adding corresponding (alias and/or real) members to the
   member list.  In addition, checks are performed to document various
   alias error conditions (orphan members, incorrect renames).

   Respond with%YES+if you want÷PDS+to provide an automatic alias check
   after each CHANGE subcommand or after a MEMLIST subcommand with the
   RESET keyword.
