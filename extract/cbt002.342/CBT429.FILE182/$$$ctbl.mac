                   MAINTAINING THE SYSTEM COMMAND TABLE


 INTRODUCTION
    The purpose of this document is to describe an easy way to maintain
    the system command table for general use and for the PDS command.
    The system command table must be updated for the PDS command if you
    want to take advantage of the LEFT, RIGHT, RFIND, and RCHANGE PFKs.

    The system command table is named ISPCMDS.  Command tables are
    described in ISPF Dialog Management Services in Chapter 3 under
    Command Tables.

    The method outlined below provides permanent command table updates;
    if you want a temporary command table additions, see the short
    example after the title "TEMPORARY COMMAND TABLE ADDITIONS" later
    in this document.


 UPDATING COMMAND TABLES
    ISPF option "3.9" provides a service to update command tables;
    however, ISPCMDS cannot be updated directly.

    For easy maintenance, a "MASTER" command table is updated and used
    to overlay ISPCMDS using ISPF option "3.3" with REPLACE = YES.

    ISPF option "3.9" reads the command table from DDNAME ISPTLIB and
    outputs the updated table to DDNAME ISPTABL.

    ISPTABL must be allocated to a single partitioned dataset, either a
    private library or a general purpose public table library.  This
    same library must be in the ISPTLIB concatenation (most likely the
    first in the list, but does not need to be first as long as the
    updated table is found first).


 THE MASTER TABLE
    The member name of the "MASTER" table is of the form xxxxCMDS and
    should be a name not used by any system.  For the purpose of this
    document, we will use MSTRCMDS.

    It is necessary to have an unused name to allow free access to
    this table at any time (command tables are held with an enqueue)
    and to allow update without affecting any system.

    To start, create MSTRCMDS by copying your current ISPCMDS (ISPCMDS
    will be in the ISPTLIB concatenation) into the library allocated to
    ISPTABL as MSTRCMDS.  It can now be updated at will using ISPF
    option "3.9".


 TESTING A NEW TABLE
    Before placing a new ISPCMDS in production you can try it
    yourself by placing a private library at the front of the
    ISPTLIB concatenation list.

    Copy the MSTRCMDS into this private library using ISPF option "3.3"
    as member ISPCMDS overlaying any previous ISPCMDS.  This new table
    will take effect when ISPF is again entered, so you must exit and
    reenter ISPF.

    To put this command table into production, overlay the production
    ISPCMDS using ISPF option "3.3".


 TABLE FOR PDS
    In order to enhance PDS ISPMODE, a sample is provided that shows
    what to add to the system command table.  This change allows PDS
    to receive LEFT, RIGHT, RFIND, and RCHANGE commands (normally
    found in Program Function Keys).

    The technique used by PDS is discussed in the ISPF Dialog Management
    Services manual under "Dynamically Specified Command Actions".  Any
    Dialog can use these command table changes for its own use.  For
    this reason, definitions were added for UP and DOWN commands but
    are not used by PDS.

    PDS sets local variables USRLEFT, USRRIGHT, USRRFIND, and USRRCHG
    to PASSTHRU before table displays and immediately resets them to
    blank after the display.  In addition a variable PDSPASS is set
    to PASSTHRU to turn off entries you may have added that may
    conflict with PDS DIALOG commands (i.e. LV).  This requires that
    you add an extra line for LV as shown in the sample table below.

 TEMPORARY COMMAND TABLE ADDITIONS
    If you do not require a permanent change to the command table,
    you may add line entries using a CLIST such as the ADDPDS CLIST
    shown below.  To invoke ADDPDS, enter ISPF as normal and enter
    "TSO %ADDPDS".

    The new command table entry may be used until you exit from ISPF.
    To enter PDS for data set LIB.CNTL, you would enter "PD LIB.CNTL".


 EXAMPLE ADDPDS CLIST
     PROC 0
     ISPEXEC TBTOP ISPCMDS
     SET ZCTVERB  = PD
     SET ZCTTRUNC = 0
     SET ZCTACT   = &STR(SELECT CMD(PDS85 &&ZPARM))
     SET ZCTDESC  = 'INVOKE THE PDS PROGRAM'
     ISPEXEC TBADD ISPCMDS
