       This series of several installments deals with a tremendously
useful productivity aid, the PDS Program Product, Version 8.0, which
can be found on the CBT mods tape for MVS.  Besides introducing
revolutionary new extensions to IBM's ISPF/PDF, it has capabilities of
pds member manipulation that truly boggle the mind.  It is (literally)
one hundred utilities, or more, rolled into one. If you spend some
time studying how to install and use PDS, the payback is guaranteed!

       To my knowledge, this series of articles is the first attempt
to create a systematic course of study to guide the reader through the
many PDS SUBCOMMANDS.  It is our aim to provide as full an overview as
possible.  To this end, we have grouped the PDS subcommands into FIVE
SECTIONS, according to their functionality (see Figure 1).

       In our last article, we introduced some of the special concepts
connected with using the PDS product.  We talked about the "CURRENT
DATASET", which is the dataset that PDS is pointing to and acting
upon.  Every time PDS executes, it has to point to a CURRENT DATASET.
The PDS SUBCOMMANDS we talked about last time dealt mostly with
finding (or changing) the attributes of the current dataset as a
whole.  Commands of that type were grouped together in SECTION ONE
of our list of PDS subcommands.

       This month's installment will concentrate on SECTIONS TWO AND
THREE of the PDS subcommands.  We will spend most of the discussion
on how to manipulate MEMBER GROUPS, and we will see how the ISPMODE
enhancements to PDS increase this capability in our hands.  In
addition, we will try and complete our overview of the ISPMODE
features, and to start opening your eyes to the productivity that
they will buy you.

       PDS deals mainly with two types of datasets, partitioned and
sequential.  If the current dataset is partitioned, there is always a
"CURRENT MEMBER GROUP", which is a subset of the members of the
current dataset.  This CURRENT MEMBER GROUP can contain ALL members of
the pds, or it can be a PROPER SUBSET of members, or it can be a NULL
subset.

       Much of the great strength of the PDS program lies in its
ability to manipulate GROUPS OF PDS MEMBERS very delicately.  The
other half of this strength is the LARGE VARIETY OF FUNCTIONS that
can easily be performed on ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE GROUP IN ONE
OPERATION.  We will discuss commands to select which members will
comprise a member group at any given time.  We will look at how
PDS commands DEAL WITH GROUPS.  And we will see how ISPMODE OPERATION
OF PDS extends our power with groups very much and very exquisitely.

       To start, we'll have to review a few basic facts about PDS
which were discussed last time.  PDS is a TSO COMMAND PROCESSOR, and
being such, it can operate directly from the READY prompt that TSO
users are familiar with.  You simply enter:
             PDS  'dataset.name'
This will begin execution of PDS and point it to 'dataset.name' as the
CURRENT DATASET.  We talked about the details of how this works in the
last issue.

       PDS can also operate interactively with ISPF/PDF.  This mode
of PDS operation is called ISPMODE.  If ISPF is in the environment of
the TSO session, ISPMODE can be entered using the "ISPMODE" or "ISPM"
subcommand, even though PDS was originally entered in native TSO or
"LINE MODE", without ISPF.  When the ISPMODE subcommand is entered,
the PDS program attempts to use all the datasets allocated for ISPF,
and it invokes itself again as a dialog manager.  PDS can also be
entered in ISPMODE initially through ISPF menus, or directly from TSO
READY through a generation option.  To see how to set these up, please
refer to the installation instructions included in the PDS package.

       What does ISPMODE operation of PDS look like?  We have supplied
a number of sample screens.

       Screen #1 is the introductory screen that is displayed when
ISPMODE is first entered. All ISPMODE screens consist of two parts,
a "TITLE" part and a "TABLE" or "LOG" part.  The TITLE part, at the
top of the screen, is composed of the fixed prompting information and
the variable DSN line of information, with the CURRENT DATASET name,
its VOLUME, and an indication of the DEFAULT MEMBER GROUP, to the
right of the "MEM=" field.

       Below the TITLE part of the screen is the LOG or TABLE
information which is scrollable, using the usual ISPF commands for
scrolling a member list, plus a few that were added by the authors of
PDS.  Screen #1, which one sees immediately upon entering ISPMODE, has
the same information in the LOG portion as if one entered a "DSN"
command initially.  The results of any new PDS commands entered from
the "command line" appear consecutively in the ISPMODE log, and this
log is positioned to view the last command that was just entered.
This action thus approximates how PDS in line-mode appears to the TSO
user, but the "VIEW LOG" has a complete record of the past actions
that occurred. It can be SCROLLED and (with Option 7) OUTPUTTED to
SYSOUT or a dataset, or previous commands in the log can be RECALLed
with the "RECALL" OR "R" command.  The capacity of the ISPMODE view
log can be controlled using the "SETLOG" ISPMODE command.

       So we have glimpsed the "VIEW MODE" ISPMODE function.  In
PDS Version 8.0, there are three more ISPMODE functions:  "MEMLIST",
"LISTA", and "LISTV".  These exist in parallel, that is, one can
switch within ISPMODE from one function to another through special
control codes from the "prompt" part of the screen.  The four functions
exist internally to the session as four separate ISPF tables which
are maintained by the PDS program.  PDS, at the 8.0 level, is cleverly
constructed so that the user can dynamically keep track of these four
sessions.

       How is this done?  Enter the "SETML" command from an ISPMODE
screen.  There will appear a special screen, part of which is
displayed as Screen #9.  Answer YES to "Function prompt" and exit the
screen with PF3.  A new screen will appear; this is illustrated as
Screen #10, the "FUNCTION PROMPT" screen.  On that screen, the four
ISPMODE functions in the session can be tracked.  The user can go in
to any one of the modes by entering an appropriate command.  For
convenience, one may want to skip this prompt screen during his
everyday work.  To do so, just enter the SETML command and answer NO
to "Function prompt".

       An explanation of "HIERARCHICAL PANELS" is in order at this
point, and then we'll go on to the other ISPMODE functions.

       The previous level of PDS, Version 7.3, did not have the four
ISPMODE functions arranged in parallel, as does Version 8.0.  The two
functions LISTA and LISTV were add-ons from what existed in previous
levels of the product.  Also, in Version 7.3, the ISPF internal
processing involved in managing the tables was different.  The
resulting structure was such, that one had to get into VIEW MODE first.
Even if he entered a prompt to get into MEMLIST mode first, he would
always go back into VIEW MODE before exiting from PDS altogether.  The
other two functions LISTA and LISTV could never be entered directly,
but only from either VIEW MODE or MEMLIST mode.  Thus the hierarchy.
VIEW MODE always came first, then MEMLIST mode, then the other two,
LISTA or LISTV.  In Version 8.0, there is still the option of keeping
this kind of relation between modes.  Just answer YES in the SETML
screen to the question about hierarchical panels.

       Now to MEMLIST.  MEMLIST is what the name implies, a list of
members of the current dataset, if it is partitioned.  The list of
members DOES NOT HAVE TO BE A COMPLETE LIST, as in ISPF (versions 2.2
and below).  An important question is:  "Which members are listed?"
This will be dealt with later.  For now, and for simplicity, lets
assume that all the members are listed.  First we want to know what
MEMLIST will do for us.

       Look at Screen #2 and Screen #4.  The first thing you'll
probably notice is that MEMLIST displays as much useful information
for a LOAD MODULE pds as for a SOURCE-TYPE pds.  At a glance, in neat
table form, one can look at groups of members and see what they're
really like.  It doesn't end there.  The alternate screens #3 and #5
show even more stats for the same members.  For load modules, the
third alternate, Screen #6, shows the information from screens #4 and
#5 TOGETHER, so one can glance at all the attributes of particular
modules at once.  Option "9" in MEMLIST screens toggles between
these alternate displays.  The added convenience of OUTPUTTING the
entire MEMLIST log with option "7" is extremely attractive if one
wants to see stats for entire libraries or subgroups of members.

       That isn't really the main purpose of MEMLIST.  Although they
are great, the statistics displays are very secondary when you look at
MEMLIST as a whole.  Its real clout is its ability to give UPWARDS OF
20 SEPARATE FUNCTIONS FROM THE SAME MENU, plus THE ABILITY TO CHANGE
LIBRARIES VERY QUICKLY.

       ISPF/PDF doesn't offer that, even in the latest releases,
although it's come a bit closer lately.  In regular ISPF as shipped
from IBM, if you want to edit a source member, you have to get into
the "EDIT" option first.  If you want to browse the same member, you
have to GET OUT of the EDIT OPTION and GO INTO the "BROWSE" option.
Then, more often then not, you have to choose the name of the member
a second time.  If you want to RENAME or DELETE the member, it's the
same pain in the neck over again--you have to get out of BROWSE
and go into UTILITIES option 3.1.  Even the new Option 3.4 doesn't
eliminate this hassle, although it saves some of the work involved.
With PDS MEMLIST, ALL OF THIS AND MORE, IS DONE WITH THE SAME MEMBER
LIST.  Enter a "B" next to the member and you "browse" it.  Enter "E"
or "S", and you SPFEDIT it.  Enter "REN" and you have the option to
rename the member.  Enter "DEL" or "SC" or "SCR" and you delete the
member.

       There are fifteen-or-so other things one can do from a
MEMLIST screen.  Enter "O" next to a member name, and one gets a
panel of OPTIONS available from there.  Enter "O" from the command
line, and there appears another panel of options for manipulating
members and the dataset itself.
