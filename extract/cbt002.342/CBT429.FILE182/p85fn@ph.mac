  The Function Selection panel provide a list of PDS supported functions
  to choose from.  It also provides the status for each function.

  Function status:
    1. %Inactive:+The function has never been selected or the function
        has been deactivated by a CHANGE command.

    2. %Active:+Function information is still available; the table for
        this function will be redisplayed if it is selected.

    3. %Pending Action:+The function had not fully completed all line
        commands when control switched to another function.

        The remaining line commands may be discarded with a CAN command.
        If a function is canceled, the pending actions will be discarded

        Note: when%END+is pressed from the log, MEMLIST, LISTA or LISTV,
        PDS will automatically select any function with pending status.
