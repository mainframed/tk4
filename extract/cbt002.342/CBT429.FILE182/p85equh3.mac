    This macro can be used for processing a group of members without
    intervention.   In this case no prompting is necessary and the
    options for prompting before any action and displaying after
    changes can be set to NO.  Otherwise, specify YES on ether as
    needed.  The Prompt before any action can be reset to YES by using
    the TSO clist REEQUAL  at any time a TSO command can be entered.

    When using the EQUAL  macro to process a group of members with
    prompting and displaying set to NO some action may be necessary
    if the edit change has an error.  Use CANCEL to continue processing
    by skipping the updating of members with change errors.  Use the
    option SAVE to continue processing, saving the changes even with
    errors.   Use DISPLAY to hold up processing while reviewing the
    errors resulting from the change operation.
