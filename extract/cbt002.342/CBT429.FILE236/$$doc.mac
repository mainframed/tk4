This file illustrates a modification to IDCAMS (a one-byte fix) to
shorten the LISTC LEVEL display on TSO.  See the member $$ILLUST to
show the effect of this modification.   See the member HOWTOFIT
to show you how to determine the place to put the zap.

Finally, we package several of these zaps in SMP/E format for your
convenience.  We've covered DFP 2.3.0, 2.4.0, 3.2.0, 3.3.0, and
DFSMS 1.1.0.

The systems programmer can test this fix by copying load module
IDCLC01 from SYS1.LINKLIB to an AUTHORIZED STEPLIB in your TSO
session, so gets executed ahead of the copy in the link list.  Zap
the copy in your STEPLIB, and then run a LISTC L(     ) command from
TSO.  Please remember that the STEPLIB will only remain authorized
if ALL members of the STEPLIB concatenation are authorized
libraries.  If one member of a STEPLIB concatenation is not
authorized, the whole concatenation becomes NOT authorized.

The following JCL stream produced the illustration in member $$ILLUST.
