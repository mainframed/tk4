HOW I WAS ABLE TO SUPPLY ZAP FITS FOR MANY LEVELS OF MODULE IDCLC01.

I was able to supply sample SMP/E usermods for many levels of the
DFP 2.3, DFP 3.2, DFP 3.3 and DFSMS 1.1.0 releases of DFP.  How was
I able to do this?

We happen to have online, an SMPPTS for ESA 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3
systems.  One of our associate data centers has a PTS dataset for
DFP/XA.

On each system, I only had one APPLYed load module IDCLC01.
However, the PDSTOOLS product from SERENA in Burlingame, California
has an Object Module Disassembler function called READOBJ.  When you
direct the READOBJ subcommand of PDSTOOLS at a PTF, all object
modules of the PTF get disassembled, with displacements shown from
the beginning of the module.  Thus, I could fit zaps on to a PTF,
without the PTF having to be APPLYed.  With PDSTOOLS, I searched the
three SMPPTS datasets for the string IDCLC01 and obtained a member
subgroup for each PTS.  Running the READOBJ command against these
members (PTFs) allowed me to fit the zap to all these PTF levels of
the module, easily.  It was all done in around one hour.
