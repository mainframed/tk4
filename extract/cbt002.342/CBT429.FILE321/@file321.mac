//***FILE 321 is from Roland Schiradin of Eltville, Germany.        *
//*           This file contains several programs:  One is a        *
//*           COBOL load module analyzer, which will tell you       *
//*           what options a COBOL CSECT was compiled with.         *
//*           Another is a started task tester, to check if a       *
//*           certain started task is running, and to set a         *
//*           condition code in a batch job as a result.            *
//*                                                                 *
