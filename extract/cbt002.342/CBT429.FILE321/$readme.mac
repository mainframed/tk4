     This is my contribution to CBT. I like the idea behind CBT and
     like to say a big "Thank you" to Sam Golob for his support and
     Gilbert Saint-Flour for giving me access to his P/390.

     It is distributed on an as is, where is basis, without expressed
     or implied warranty of any kind. It is distributed in hope that
     it may save other members of the project some wheel re-inventing.

     COBANAL   This Program analyze your Cobol-Load-Modules.
               There is no need for the source. Support
               for single programs also for a complete load-lib.
               This program require the STRING macro from FILE183.
               I have include the current versions of STRING and
               STRINGXA. Thanks to Gilbert Saint-Flour

               Full support for COBOL for MVS and VM formally called
               COBOL/370 or ADCYLE COBOl/370.
               Full support for COBOL-II every version.
               Few support for COBOL-I.

               If you have old or newer Cobol-Programs please
               send me the Load to Roland(at)Schiradin.de. I'll
               add some code to support those Cobol-Versions.

               If you like to get the newest Version please contact
               Roland(at)Schiradin.de

               You can find a nice ISPF interface for CobAnal on

     STCCHECK  This program check if a started Task is allready
               active. This avoid abend U1800 if a operator
               start the same CICS again. Please note this works
               only on the same MVS-image, I'll add somtimes
               code to check the SYSPLEX.

               //*******************  EXECUTE CICS
               //*****************************************
               //STCCHECK EXEC PGM=STCCHECK,PARM='DCCA201'
               //SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*
               //SYSUDUMP  DD SYSOUT=D
               //*****************************************
               //DCCSTRT IF (STCCHECK.RC = 0) THEN
               //DCCA201 EXEC PROC=DCICSA
               //EDCCSTRT ENDIF

               rc = 0   DCCA201 is not active
               rc not 0 DCCA201 is active
