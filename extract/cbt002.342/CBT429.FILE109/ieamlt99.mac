*
*01* DESCRIPTIVE NAME = THIS MODULE LISTS TABLE (MLT) CAN BE USED AS
*                       THE PROTOTYPE FOR THE MLT FOR A UNIT RECORD
*                       DEVICE IN WHICH YOU SPECIFY THE ERROR RECOVERY
*                       PROCEDURE (ERP). THE STANDARD UNIT RECORD
*                       DEVICE SUPPORT EXITS ARE ALSO USED.
*
*01* FUNCTION =
*      IEAMLT99 IS A LOAD MODULE THAT CONTAINS THE LIST OF
*      NUCLEUS DEVICE DEPENDENT MODULE NAMES AND THE LIST OF
*      LINK PACK AREA (LPA) DEVICE DEPENDENT MODULE NAMES
*      REQUIRED FOR THE UNITVALUE DEVICE.
*
*02*   OPERATION =
*      IF THE I/O CONFIGURATION SELECTED FOR AN IPL DEFINES THE
*      SPECIFIED DEVICE, THE SYSTEM LOADS THE CORRESPONDING MLT INTO
*      THE IPL WORK SPACE. THE LISTED NUCLEUS MODULES ARE LOADED
*      FROM SYS1.NUCLEUS INTO NUCLEUS REGION AND THE LISTED LPA
*      MODULES ARE LOADED FROM SYS1.LINKLIB, OR ANY DATA SET IN
*      THE LINK LIST (LNKLST) CONCATENATION, INTO THE LPA.
