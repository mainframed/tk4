    THIS MEMBER IS A SHORT DESCRIPTION OF THE MEMBERS INCLUDED IN THIS
    FILE.

    ASMACTRT IS THE JCL WE USE TO ASSEMBLE THE SMF EXIT IEFACTRT.  YOU
             WILL NEED TO CHANGE THE JCL ACCORDINGLY.

    IEFACTRT IS THE SOURCE CODE FOR THE IEFACTRT EXIT AS WE USE IT.
             THIS SOURCE IS A COMBINATION OF VARIOUS IEFACTRT ROUTINES
             FROM PREVIOUS CBT TAPES AND SOME OF MY OWN ENHANCEMENTS.
             IT HAS BEEN WRITTEN TO USE THE SMF TYPE 30 RECORD AND TO
             RUN IN 31 BIT ADDRESSING MODE.  AN EXAMPLE OF THE OUTPUT
             IS INCLUDED IN ANOTHER FILE ON THIS TAPE. THIS EXIT WILL
             WORK UNDER MVS/XA 2.2 AND MVS/ESA.  IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO
             RUN UNDER PREVIOUS XA RELEASES.

             FEATURES - ISSUSES A WTO TO THE SYSTEM CONSOLE WITH THE
