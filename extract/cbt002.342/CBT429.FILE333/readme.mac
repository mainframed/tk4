p (GNU zip) is a compression utility designed to be a replacement{for '
'. Its main advantages over compress are much better›compression and fr
om patented algorithms.êThe GNU Projectªuses it as the standard compre
ogram for its system.²×Egzip currently uses by default the LZ77 algorith
n zip 1.9 (the°¿portable pkzip compatible archiver). The gzip format was
{designed to accommodate several compression algorithms. See belowõfor
rison of zip and gzip.×Agunzip can currently decompress files created b
compress orŸpack. The detection of the input format is automatic.fFor
p format, gunzip checks a 32 bit CRC. For pack, gunzip checks theluncom
length.÷The 'compress' format was not designed to allow±Cconsistency ch
wever gunzip is sometimes able to detect a badE.Z file because there is
dundancy in the .Z compression format.°CIf you get an error when uncompr
 .Z file, do not assume thatEthe .Z file is correct simply because the
 uncompress does not°hcomplain.¹This generally means that the standard
ss does not±µcheck its input, and happily generates garbage output.×Bgz
ces files with a .gz extension. Previous versions of gzipªused the .z e
, which was already used by the 'pack'²]Huffman encoder. gunzip is able
press .z files (packed¯or gzip'ed).„×BSeveral planned features are not

ry unfortunate choice, because zip and gzipEare two really different pr
