Notes for Mike Cleary's version of CDSCB

   This is Mike Cleary's version of the CDSCB command that is on
   File 300 of the CBT Tape.

   This version uses RACROUTE to determine if the user can change
   the DSCB of the dataset.  ALTER authority is required.  I am
   leaving the old version of CDSCB on File 300, because another
   user may not want to use this type of authority checking in the
   CDSCB command, but may prefer the USERID method, or the installer,
   if he feels safe enough, may want to turn the authority checking
   off altogether.  Therefore the other version, from File 300, will
   be the preferable one to work with.  It depends upon your
   requirements.  Anyway, Mike's work is here for you to profit
   from.
