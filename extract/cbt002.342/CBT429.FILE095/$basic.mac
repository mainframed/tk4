    WHAT IS AN EDIT MACRO?   IT  IS  A  SET OF INSTRUCTIONS TO PERFORM
    SOME TASK WHILE IN EDIT.   SOUNDS  SIMPLE  DOESN'T IT?  TO BE VERY
    TRUTHFUL EDIT MACROS CAN BE  SIMPLE  OR  THEY CAN BE VERY COMPLEX.
    THEY CAN BE WRITTEN IN A  VARIETY OF LANGUAGES, CLIST, REXX, PL/1,
    COBOL AND ALC TO MENTION THE MOST POPULAR.

    HOW ARE EDIT MACROS USED?  TO START  WITH YOU MUST BE IN AN ACTIVE
    EDIT SESSION.  NEXT YOU  MUST  HAVE  A  WAY  OF ACCESSING THE EDIT
    MACROS YOU WANT TO  USE.   FOR  CLIST'S  AND REXX EDIT MACROS THEY
    SHOULD BE IN A  SYSPROC  LIBRARY.   COMPILED  OR ASSEMBLED MODULES
    SHOULD BE IN THE LINKLIST  OR  IN  THE  ISPLLIB LIBRARY.  TO USE A
    CLIST OR REXX MODULE, SIMPLY  TYPE  THE  MACRO NAME ON THE COMMAND
    LINE OF  THE  EDIT  PANEL  FOLLOWED  BY  ANY  PARAMETERS NEEDED BY
    MACRO.  IF RANGE OR DESTINATION  PARAMETERS ARE NEEDED ENTER THOSE
    IN THE PROPER PLACE.  COMPILED MACROS NEED A LITTLE MORE ATTENTION
    TO WORK PROPERLY.  TO  USE  A  COMPILED  MACRO FOR THE FIRST TIME,
    PRECEDE IT WITH AN  EXCLAMATION  MARK  "!".  !ASMMAC WOULD EXECUTE
    THE COMPILED MACRO NAMED  ASMMAC  FOR  THE  FIRST TIME.  AFTER THE
    INITIAL USE, THE MACRO NAME  IS  ONLY NEEDED.  COMPILED MACROS CAN
    ALSO BE DEFINED IN A SPECIAL  MACRO CALLED INITIAL MACRO.  IF THEY
    ARE DEFINED IN  THE  INITIAL  MACRO  THE  EXCLAMATION  MARK IS NOT
    NEEDED.

    THE INITIAL MACRO CAN  BE  VERY  IMPORTANT WHEN USING EDIT MACROS.
    IF THE  MACRO  NAME  CONFLICTS  WITH  OTHER  SYSTEM  COMMANDS, THE
    INITIAL MACRO CAN BE  USED  TO  DETERMINE  WHICH COMMAND SHOULD BE
    USED.  SC34-4121-00 EDIT AND EDIT  MACROS OUTLINES THE USE OF EDIT
    MACROS AND PROVIDES INFORMATION ON EDIT MACRO COMMANDS.
