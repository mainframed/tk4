             SETTING UP FOR USING EDIT MACROS IN THIS FILE

    THESE MACROS ARE A COLLECTION  OF  VARIOUS EDIT MACROS THAT MAY BE
    SOMEWHAT USEFUL  AT  YOUR  INSTALLATION.   SOME  OF  THEM  ARE  MY
    ORIGINAL, AND OTHERS ARE FROM OTHER SHARE USERS.  ALL OF THEM WORK
    AT THIS SITE.  SOME MAY WILL  NEED  TO BE MODIFIED TO WORK AT YOUR
    SITE.  TO USE THEM YOU  WILL  NEED  TO  HAVE ISPF 2.2 OR LATER AND
    TSO/E REL 3 OR LATER.  THIS SITE HAS ISPF 2.3 AND TSO/E REL 4.

    TO EASE THE BURDEN  ON  THE  CBTMOD  TAPE  I HAVE COMBINED ALL THE
    MACROS, PANELS, SOURCE,  JCL,  AND  INSTRUCTIONS  INTO ONE PDS.  I
    HAVE PROVIDED SOME SAMPLE JCL TO UNLOAD THE PANELS AND MACROS INTO
    THE PROPER PDS'S WITH NAMES  THAT THE MACROS EXPECT.  SAMPLE COBOL
    JCL IS PROVIDED IN  THE  JOBSTREAM  TO  COMPILE  AND LINK THE LOAD
    MODULES NEEDED.

    EXAMINE  THE  MEMBER  $SAMPJCL   AND   MODIFY   IT  TO  MEET  YOUR
    INSTALLATION NAMING  STANDARDS  AND  PROPER  COMPILE  JCL.   ADD A
    JOBCARD AND SUBMIT THE JCL.  YOU  ARE NOW READY TO USE THE MACROS.

    NOTE.....  DUE TO  THE  POSSIBILITY  OF  THESE  MACROS HAVING LIKE
    NAMES WITH OTHER CLISTS  AND  MODULES  AT YOUR INSTALLATION PLEASE
    REVIEW THEM BEFORE SUBMITTING THE JCL  TO MAKE SURE YOU DON'T WIPE
    OUT YOUR OWN VALUABLE CLISTS OR LOAD MODULES.

    AS AN AID THE TABLBLD CLIST IN THIS DATA SET WILL BUILD A TABLE OF
    THE EDIT MACROS AND CLISTS.  THIS TABLE CAN BE DISPLAYED USING THE
    EMACS MACRO OR CLIST.  THIS CLIST  MUST BE EDITED TO POINT TO THIS
    DATA SET SO THE $DESCRPT MEMBER MAY BE FOUND.
