    I WILL MAINTAIN ALL THE  MACROS  SHIPPED  WITH THIS TAPE AS BEST I
    CAN.  I ENCOURAGE ANYONE WHO HAS  EDIT MACROS THAT ARE NOT ON THIS
    FILE,OR ONE THAT WORKS BETTER  TO  SEND  THEM TO ME.  I WILL TEST,
    DOCUMENT, AND I WILL PUT THE BEST ONES ON THE TAPE, AND RETURN THE
    SUBMITTED TAPE WITH A NEW  COPY  OF  ALL  THE LATEST MACROS ON THE
    FILE.

    MY GOAL IS TO STOP REINVENTING THE WHEEL, BUT STILL USE THE LATEST
    TECHNOLOGY POSSIBLE TO DO THE JOB.

    THE MACROS ON THIS  FILE  ARE  ONLY  A  PARTIAL  LISTING OF WHAT I
    HAVE.  THE ON ON THIS TAPE  ARE  GENERAL PURPOSE, AND THE OTHERS I
    HAVE TEND TO BE  SPECIAL  PURPOSE  (OR INSTALLATION SENSETIVE).  I
    WILL  GLADLY  PROVIDE  THE  NON  SENSETIVE  MACROS  TO  ANYONE WHO
    CONTRIBUTES TO THE FILE BUT I DON'T WANT TO CLUTTER UP THE CBTMODS
    TAPE WITH MACROS THAT MAY NOT BE OF INTEREST TO OTHERS.

    HELP CAN BE OBTAINED  FOR  MOST  ALL  EDIT  MACROS IN THIS FILE BY
    TYPING THE MACRO NAME  FOLLOWED  BY  A  QUESTION MARK:  CUT ?  THE
    PANELS FOR THE MACRO MUST BE  IN THE ISPPLIB CONCATENATION FOR THE
    HELP FUNCTION TO WORK.
