 Text processing on TSO has made strides with the introduction of:

 PARA reformats paragraphs easily.   Now  you  can  type a memo using TE
 (Text Enter), and rework it,  adding  lines, blanking or deleting words
 and phrases, then reformat  your  paragraphs  easily.   I can hear some
 questions in your mind:

  1) What do you mean by reformat?

     Para can change  left  and  right  margins, first line indentation,
     move words from line  to  line  to  adjust line length, justify the
     left margin, optionally  justify  the  right  margin, and double or
     single space after end of sentences.
      8
     It means that     It means that you  can  create paragraphs side by
     you       can     side.  These paragraphs are examples.
     easily create
     very,   very,        It means that you can indent paragraphs to the
     very,   very,     right; this paragraph is an example.
     tall, skinny,
     slender,          It means that  you  can  indent paragraphs to the
     willowy,             left.  This paragraph is an example.
     lean,  narrow
     paragraphs        You do not have to right justify paragraphs. Or
     like     this     indent the first line. Or double space after the
     one.              end of a sentence. This is an example.

                              With   some
                            ingenuity,  you
                          can          create
                        paragraphs    in   many
                      different styles.   You can
                    create  impact  by  the  visual
                  appearance  of  your  writing,  and
                make your  letters  and  memoranda more
                effective.  True, visual appearance can
                  never replace the lasting impact of
                    content,  but  it  can increase
                      the attention people pay to
                        your   letters.   After
                          all,   didn't   you
                            read this  far?

               New Edit Command: PARA, an improved TFLOW
 =======================================================================

              You can  even  center  paragraphs after you
              have   reformatted    them.     Like   this
                        paragraph, for example.

 B                You can reformat   paragraphs
 E     that look like this              paragraph with one command.
 F     This paragraph looks
 O        like some paragraphs I have created when I
 R       was just putting my thoughts down, then went back over the
 E    paragraph and cleaned it up.
 !          SEE!

 A      You can reformat paragraphs  that  look like this paragraph with
 F   one command.  This  paragraph  looks  like  some  paragraphs I have
 T   created when I was just  putting  my  thoughts down, then went back
 E   over the paragraph and cleaned it up.  SEE!
 R

  2) What do you mean by easily?

     You tell PARA  what  to  do  by  coding  PARA  on  the command line
     followed by keyword=value or keyword combinations, then use zz line
     commands to mark the start and end of the paragraph:

        EDIT --- $AFSS.MEMOS.DATA(PARA) - 01.00 ------------------
        COMMAND ===> PARA NL=6 NR=72 I=3 J D
        zz 068              You can reformat   paragraphs
        000069   that look like this              paragraph with o
        000070   This paragraph looks
        000071      like some paragraphs I have created when I
        000072     was just putting my thoughts down, then went ba
        000073  paragraph and cleaned it up.
        zz 074        SEE!

     PARA will remember these  combinations  during the ISPF session, so
     you only have to code any changes the next time you execute PARA.

        EDIT --- $AFSS.MEMOS.DATA(PARA) - 01.00 ------------------
        COMMAND ===> PARA I=0
        zz 081     You tell PARA what to do by coding PARA
        000082        on the command line,
        zz 083  followed by keyword=value or keyword combinations:

  3) What if I forget these combinations?

     You can ask  PARA  to  tell  you  its current combinations, without
     doing any paragraph reformatting.  Example:

        EDIT --- $AFSS.MEMOS.DATA(PARA) - 01.00 ------------------
        COMMAND ===> PARA ?
        000081     You tell PARA what to do by coding PARA
        ==MSG> PARA PARAMETERS: OL=1 NL=6 OR=72 NR=72 I=0 J D

                         INTEROFFICE MEMORANDUM
                         ======================

               New Edit Command: PARA, an improved TFLOW
 =======================================================================


     You can then delete the PARA parameters message line.  Example:

        EDIT --- $AFSS.MEMOS.DATA(PARA) - 01.00 ------------------
        COMMAND ===>
        000081     You tell PARA what to do by coding PARA
        d MSG> PARA PARAMETERS: OL=1 NL=6 OR=72 NR=72 I=0 J D


  4) What are all these PARA parameters?

     A reference appendix is attached.





                            PARA PARAMETERS                       page 1
                           Reference Appendix
                            ===============

  Parameters that PARA remembers during an ISPF session:
  ______________________________________________________

  OL=nn    Old Left side of the paragraph
  __       _   _
  OR=nn    Old Right side of the paragraph
  __       _   _

           The Old parameters tell PARA  where  to find the paragraph to
           be reformatted.  The first time  PARA executes during an ISPF
           session, the Old parameters  normally  default to the display
           columns on the left and right  sides of the screen.  You will
           only change the Old parameters when:
            (1) You are editing a  document  wider  than the screen size
                (i.e., 133 wide for a 3278 model 2, 80 columns wide).
            (2) Or, when there is  textual  material that you don't want
                to include on the left or right side of the paragraph to
                be reformatted.  Example:
                  EDIT --- $AFSS.WORK.CNTL(SAMPLE) - 01.00 -------------
                  COMMAND ===>
                  =COLS> ----+----1----+----2----+----3----+----4----+--
                  000003 //*  THIS IS A DEMAND DEPOSIT JOB.            *
                  000004 //*    IT RUNS WEEKLY, EVERY MONDAY, ROLLING  *
                  000005 //* FORWARD IF MONDAY IS A HOLIDAY.           *
                In this example, you don't want the //*  and the * to be
                included in your new paragraph, so you code:
                  EDIT --- $AFSS.WORK.CNTL(SAMPLE) - 01.00 -------------
                  COMMAND ===> PARA OL=4 OR=46 NL=4 NR=45
                  =COLS> ----+----1----+----2----+----3----+----4----+--
                  zz 003 //*  THIS IS A DEMAND DEPOSIT JOB.            *
                  000004 //*    IT RUNS WEEKLY, EVERY MONDAY, ROLLING  *
                  zz 005 //* FORWARD IF MONDAY IS A HOLIDAY.           *
                to exclude them from  the reformatted  paragraph.  Don't
                forget to change them  back  if you switch from JCL to a
                memorandum.

  NL=nn    New Left side of the paragraph
  __       _   _
  NR=nn    New Right side of the paragraph
  __       _   _

           The New parameters  tell  PARA  where  to put the reformatted
           paragraph.  The New parameters  are the most frequently coded
           parameters.

  I=nn     Indent the first line of the paragraph nn spaces (default:0)
  _        _

           The Indent  parameter  can  be  either  zero  (no indenting),
           positive (Indent nn spaces to the right), or negative (Indent
           nn spaces to the left).

  J        right margin Justification (default)
  _                     _
  NJ       No right margin Justification
  __       _               _

           If J is specified, PARA  will  insert the necessary number of
           spaces into each line  of  the  paragraph  to right align the
           right margin.  The last line will not be justified.

                           Reference Appendix
                            ===============

  D        Double space after end of sentence (default)
  _        _
  ND       No Double space after end of sentence
  __       _  _

           The following are recognized as end of sentence:
             . . . end of sentence.
             . . . end of sentence!
             . . . end of sentence?
             . . . end of sentence:
             . . . end of sentence"

  Parameters that PARA will not remember (one time only):
  _______________________________________________________

  ?        What are PARA's current parameters?
  _                                          _

           If ?  is specified,  a  msgline  is  created with the current
           values of the PARA parameters.  Example:
             EDIT --- $AFSS.MEMOS.DATA(PARA) - 01.00 ------------------
             COMMAND ===> PARA ?
             000081     You tell PARA what to do by coding PARA
             ==MSG> PARA PARAMETERS: OL=1 NL=6 OR=72 NR=72 I=0 J D

  C        Center paragraph
  _        _
  NC       No Centering of paragraph (default)
  __       _  _

           Centering means  center  inside  the  OL/OR boundaries.  This
           allows you to reformat  a  paragraph,  view the results, then
           center the paragraph  inside  your  document without figuring
           out any new parameters.   Centering  does not reformat, since
           the results  after  both  reformatting  and  centering may be
           unexpected.

  HELP     display HELP information
  ____             ____

           If HELP  is  specified,  msglines  are  created which briefly
           explain the PARA parameters.  Example:
             EDIT --- $AFSS.MEMOS.DATA(PARA) - 01.00 ------------------
             COMMAND ===> PARA HELP

           If you  want  your  PARA  parameters  to  be  remembered from
           session to session, specify  PROF  once  only.  From then on,
           PARA will store your PARA  parameters in your PROFile dataset
           instead of in the SHARED variable pool.  Specify SHAR  if you
           change your mind.

  RH       Remove Hyphens and reconnect words
  __       _      _

           Remove Hyphens means if you have  one word split across mult-
           iple lines with a hyphen (like  mult- iple in this sentence),
           the  hyphen (-)  will  be   removed  and  the  word  will  be
           reconnected into one word (i.e. multiple) before reformatting
           occurs.

           Why have this routine?  Two reasons:
            (1) Suppose you made an  error  previously when you executed
                PARA, making NL and NR too close together. If PARA finds
                a word that cannot  fit  between  NL and NR, PARA splits
                the word into two or more pieces, hyphenating them. Many
                words might have  been  split  into pieces. This routine
                makes recovery easy: just  execute PARA with the correct
                NL/NR pair and RH.
            (2) Suppose you  are  modifying  old  text,  with many words
                hyphenated. Your changes will shift  the position of the
                hyphenated words  within   the   paragraph,  moving  the
                hyphenated words to the middle of the line. This routine
                saves a lot of manual unhyphenation time.

  LC       change paragraph to Lower Case
  __                           _     _

           LC causes UPPER CASE text in  the  box defined by OL, OR, and
           the ZZ line commands to be transformed to lower case letters.
           Start of sentence words will still be capitalized.

           Why have this routine?  Two reasons:
            (1) Suppose under TE (text entry)  you  typed a lot of upper
                and lower case text while  editing  a data set which had
                CAPS=ON.  The text would  be converted entirely to UPPER
                CASE.  It is faster to  change  the entire text to lower
                case and recapitalize where  required than to retype the
                entire text.
            (2) Suppose you are modifying old  text,  all of which is in
                capitals.  You want your revised  text in both upper and
                lower case.  It is faster  to  change the entire text to
                lower  case  and  recapitalize  where  required  than to
                retype the entire text.
