SECTNINTRODUCTION
HEAD WHAT RDOC72 DOES
PARA      RDOC IS A UCC PACKAGE THAT PRINTS DOCUMENTATION USING COLUMNS
     1 THROUGH 5 FOR SEQUENCE NUMBERS.   PEOPLES NATIONAL BANK OF WASH-
     TON HAS MODIFIED UCC RDOC SO THAT COLUMNS 1 THROUGH 5 ARE FOR
     COMMAND WORDS, COLUMNS 6 THROUGH 72 ARE FOR TEXT DATA AND COLUMNS
     73 THROUGH 80 ARE FOR SEQUENCE NUMBERS. THE RESULT IS CALLED      .
     RDOC72.  RDOC72 PRINTED WHAT YOU ARE NOW READING.  THE REASON WE
     USE RDOC72 IS TO SAVE EFFORT IN WRITING AND REVISING DOCUMENTATION.
     IT SHOULD BE USED TO DOCUMENT:
PARIN* FILES
IND-A* PROGRAM SPECIFICATIONS
IND-A* STANDARDS
IND-A* RUN BOOKS
IND-A* OTHER THINGS
PARA IN ORDER TO SIMPLIFY YOUR INTRODUCTION TO RDOC72, ONLY A PORTION
     OF THE SYSTEM WILL BE EXPLAINED HERE, AND THE EMPHASIS WILL BE ON
     HOW TO USE IT.  A MORE COMPLETE DISCUSSION OF RDOC72 MAY BE FOUND
     IN THE 50+ PAGE MANUAL THAT CAME WITH THE RDOC SYSTEM.

     RDOC72 FEATURES INCLUDE:
PARIN* CARD OR TAPE (INFOREX) OR DISK (LIBRARIAN) INPUT
IND-A* AUTOMATIC TABLE OF CONTENTS
IND-A* MULTIPLE COPIES
IND-A* HEADINGS, PAGE NUMBERING, COVER PAGE AND OTHER 'NIFTY' THINGS

     THE FOLLOWING PAGE SHOWS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW YOU MAY USE RDOC72 TO
     DOCUMENT A FILE.

     AS A GENERAL GUIDELINE YOU WILL START A BOOK BY CODING THE
     FOLLOWING CONTROL CARDS IN THE ORDER GIVEN BELOW.  SEE APPENDIX A
     FOR DETAILS ON THE CODING OF EACH CONTROL CARD.

INDEXJCL
     YOUR INPUT MAY BE TAKEN DIRECTLY FROM CARDS OR THRU LIBRARIAN OR
     INFOREX TAPE.  ALSO, RDOC72 MAY BE RUN ON OS OR DOS.  DECIDE UPON
     YOUR MODE OF OPERATION AND THEN USE THE JCL FROM APPENDIX B (OS)
     OR APPENDIX C (DOS).

     IF YOU USE LIBRARIAN, NAME YOUR MODULE THE SAME AS ITS BOOK NAME.
     STANDARDS FOR BOOK NAMES ARE GIVEN IN APPENDIX D.
INDEXLIBRARIAN INPUT
     RDOC72 ALLOWS SEQUENCING IN COLUMNS 73 THROUGH 80 OR ANY SUBSET
     OF THIS RANGE.

     A LIBRARIAN MODULE MAY BE INCORPORATED IN SEVERAL BOOKS.  AN
     EXAMPLE MIGHT BE A GLOSSARY.  USE AN -INC LIBRARIAN CARD (IN
     EITHER A PERMINENT OR TEMPORARY UPDATE).
SECT GENERAL INFORMATION
     THE SYSTEM PRINTS NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION ON EIGHT AND ONE-HALF
     BY ELEVEN INCH PAPER.  FORMAT, SPACING AND SKIPPING ARE CON-
     TROLLED BY SPECIAL CONTROL WORDS AND A TABLE OF CONTENTS IS
     AUTOMATICALLY CREATED.
PARA EACH PRINTING OF THE DOCUMENTATION CONTAINS THE CURRENT DATE IN
     THE HEADING LINE ON EACH PAGE SO THAT OUTDATED DOCUMENTATION MAY
     BE DESTROYED.  THE SPEED OF PREPARATION REDUCES THE USUAL DELAYS
     THAT INHIBIT THE PROGRESS OF MOST SYSTEM DESIGN EFFORTS.
HEAD INPUT TO THE SYSTEM
PARINONE OF THE PRINCIPLE REASONS FOR DEVELOPING SUCH A SYSTEM IS TO
     SAVE  TIME SPENT MAINTAINING AND EXPANDING DOCUMENTATION.
     ONCE THE TEXT HAS BEEN WRITTEN, IT IS ENTERED INTO THE SYSTEM.
     THE INPUT CARD IS DIVIDED INTO THREE BASIC SECTIONS AS FOLLOWS:
SPAC1
IND-ACOLUMNS  1 - 5  CONTROL WORD
SPAC1
IND-DTHIS IS A WORD CONTAINING A MAXIMUM OF FIVE CHAR-
IND-DACTERS WHICH CONTROLS THE FORMAT OF THE DOCUMEN-
IND-DTATION TO BE PRINTED.  IT MAY BE INSERTED BY THE
IND-DAUTHOR WHEN AND WHERE DESIRED TO CONTROL THE
IND-DFORMAT.  A LIST OF CONTROL WORDS AND THEIR FUNC-
IND-DTIONS FOLLOWS IN A LATER SECTION.
SPAC1
IND-ACOLUMNS 6 - 72  NARRATIVE
SPAC1
IND-DTHIS FIELD CONTAINS THE ACTUAL DATA TO BE PRINTED
IND-DON THE FINISHED REPORT.  GENERALLY, A LINE OF
IND-DPRINTING CAN CONTAIN 67 CHARACTERS, BUT CERTAIN
IND-DTYPES OF CARDS HAVE LENGTH AND/OR CONTENT RESTRIC-
IND-DTIONS.  NARRATIVE FIELD RESTRICTIONS, WHERE APPLI-
IND-DCABLE, ARE DISCUSSED UNDER THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE
IND-DVARIOUS CONTROL WORDS.  (SEE ALSO - CONTROL WORD
IND-DFORMATS.)
SPAC1
IND-ACOLUMNS  73 - 80  SEQUENCE NUMBER
SPAC1
IND-DTHIS NUMBER IS PUNCHED INTO THE CARDS FOR THE PUR-
IND-DPOSE OF KEEPING THEM IN SEQUENCE.  THE NUMBERS CAN
IND-DBE PUT IN AS THE CARDS ARE PUNCHED INITIALLY, OR
IND-DTHEY CAN BE PUT IN BY THE PROGRAM AT A LATER TIME.
IND-D(SEE CONTROL WORD 'SEQ')
HEAD OUTPUTS FROM THE SYSTEM
INDEX* NARRATIVE DESCRIPTIONS
IND-AONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PURPOSES OF THE DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM
     IS THE PREPARATION OF NARRATIVE DESCRIPTIONS OF SYSTEMS.
     THE MATERIAL YOU ARE NOW READING IS ONE BOOK FROM AN ENTIRE
     LIBRARY OF DOCUMENTATION.  EACH BOOK IN THE LIBRARY CAN BE
     DIVIDED INTO SECTIONS.  THESE SECTIONS CAN BE DIVIDED INTO
     TOPICS WHICH CAN BE FURTHER DIVIDED INTO SUB-TOPICS IF
     DESIRED.  THIS BOOK DESCRIBING THE DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM
     IS ORGANIZED IN THAT MANNER.
PARINTHE SYSTEM IS ALSO SUITED TO PREPARATION OF FILE DESCRIPTIONS,
     PROCESSING STEP DEFINITIONS, ETC., BECAUSE OF THE FORMATTING
     CAPABILITIES WHICH ARE BUILT IN.
INDEX* TABLES OF CONTENTS
IND-AUNLESS SUPPRESSED, THE SYSTEM AUTOMATICALLY PRODUCES A NEW TABLE
     OF CONTENTS EACH TIME A NARRATIVE IS PRINTED.  IF NEW DATA HAS
     BEEN ADDED OR IF DATA HAS BEEN DELETED, THE SYSTEM AUTOMATI-
     CALLY RENUMBERS THE PAGES AND PRODUCES A NEW TABLE OF CONTENTS
     SHOWING THE PAGE NUMBERS OF SECTIONS, TOPICS, AND SUB-TOPICS AS
     DESCRIBED ABOVE.  THIS AVOIDS THE NECESSITY OF DEVELOPING COMPLI-
     CATED PAGE NUMBERING SCHEMES TO ALLOW FOR EXPANSION.
INDEX* PRINTING PORTIONS OF A BOOK
IND-AAT TIMES, THE AUTHOR MAY WISH TO PRINT ONLY ONE SECTION, A FEW
     PAGES, OR EVEN A SINGLE PAGE FROM A LARGE BOOK.  THIS MIGHT BE
     DESIRED, FOR EXAMPLE, IF ONLY A FEW PAGES OF A BOOK REQUIRE
     REVISION.  SINCE THE AUTHOR MAY EXERCISE COMPLETE CONTROL OVER
     PAGE NUMBERING, THIS IS NO LONGER A PROBLEM.  THE AUTHOR MAY EVEN
     CAUSE THE SYSTEM TO UTILIZE SUB-PAGE NUMBERS TO INSERT NEW PAGES
     BETWEEN EXISTING PAGES WITHOUT REPRINTING THE REST OF
     THE BOOK.  IN GENERAL, THE AUTHOR MAY EXERCISE AS MUCH OR AS
     LITTLE CONTROL OVER SUCH ITEMS AS DESIRED.
INDEX* REPORT SAMPLES
IND-ASAMPLE REPORTS OF ANY SIZE OR SHAPE CAN BE PRINTED ON ANY KIND OF
     CONTINUOUS FORMS SUITABLE FOR USE IN A COMPUTER.  THE AUTHOR MAY
     CHANGE BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN NARRATIVES AND REPORTS AS NECES-
     SARY, AND MAY ALSO DIRECT THE COMPUTER TO STOP AND PROVIDE THE A
     MESSAGE INSTRUCTING THE OPERATOR TO CHANGE FROM ONE TYPE OF PAPER
     TO ANOTHER.
INDEX* MULTIPLE COPIES
IND-AUP TO 99 COPIES (ALL ORIGINALS) CAN BE PRODUCED IN A SINGLE PASS
     OF THE INPUT CARDS.  A TABLE OF CONTENTS IS AUTOMATICALLY
     PRODUCED FOR EACH COPY.  NORMALLY, HOWEVER, WE PRODUCE NO MORE
     THAN A TOTAL OF 100 PAGES ON THE COMPUTER.  IF MORE COPIES ARE
     REQUIRED, WE CREATE A DOCUMENT TAPE AND PRINT THE DOCUMENTS ON AN
     OFF-LINE PRINTER USING THE TWO-UP OPTION.
INDEX* DIAGNOSTICS
IND-AAS THE INPUT DATA IS PROCESSED AND PRINTED BY THE SYSTEM, IT IS
     ALSO EDITED FOR VALIDITY.  ANY ERRORS DISCOVERED DURING PRO-
     CESSING ARE PRINTED ON A DIAGNOSTICS REPORT AT THE END OF THE
     FIRST COPY.  THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR EACH CONTROL WORD ARE
     GIVEN IN THE SECTION ON CONTROL WORDS.
PARINTHE DIAGNOSTICS REPORT CONTAINS TWO LINES FOR EACH ERROR DIS-
     COVERED.  THE FIRST LINE GIVES THE SEQUENTIAL NUMBER OF THE CARD
     IN ERROR, THE PAGE NUMBER (AND SUB-PAGE NUMBER IF APPROPRIATE),
     AND AN ERROR MESSAGE EXPLAINING WHAT ERROR WAS DISCOVERED AND THE
     ACTION TAKEN BY THE SYSTEM.  THE SECOND LINE GIVES THE INFORMATION
     CONTAINED IN THE ERRONEOUS INPUT RECORD.  ALL THREE FIELDS IN THE
     INPUT RECORD ARE DISPLAYED - THE CONTROL WORD (1-5), THE NARRATIVE
     (6-72) AND THE SEQUENCE NUMBER (73-80).NOTE THAT THE SEQUENTIAL
     NUMBER ON THE FIRST LINE IS DERIVED INTERNALLY BY THE PROGRAM
     COUNTING RECORDS AND THE INPUT RECORD NUMBER ON THE SECOND LINE IS
     TAKEN DIRECTLY FROM COLUMNS 73-80 OF THE INPUT.
PARA      IF NO ERRORS ARE DISCOVERED DURING PRINTING, THE MESSAGE,
     'NONE' IS PRINTED ON THE DIAGNOSTICS REPORT.
INDEX* RESEQUENCED INPUT DECKS
IND-ATHE SYSTEM WILL PUNCH A RESEQUENCED INPUT DECK IF A CONTROL WORD
     'SEQ' IS ENCOUNTERED PRIOR TO PRINTING THE FIRST LINE OF A GIVEN
     BOOK.
HEAD CHARACTERS WHICH MAY BE USED
DOUBL
     BECAUSE OF THE CONFIGURATION OF THE PRINT CHAIN OF THE IBM 1403
     PRINTER, ONLY CERTAIN CHARACTERS MAY BE USED IN THE PRINTING OF
     DOCUMENTATION.  A LIST OF PERMISSIBLE CHARACTERS FOLLOWS--

HEAD GENERAL SYSTEM FLOW
PARA THE DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM CONSISTS OF ONE COBOL PROGRAM HAVING
     THREE SEPARATE PHASES.  IN THE FIRST PHASE, NARRATIVES, REPORT
     SAMPLES, TABLES, ETC., ARE READ FROM INPUT CARDS.  THE FIRST COPY
     OF THE DE- SIRED DOCUMENTATION IS FORMATTED ACCORDING TO THE
     CONTROL WORDS GIVEN BY THE AUTHOR.  AS THE FIRST COPY IS
     GENERATED, ENTRIES WILL BE MADE IN THE 'TABLE OF CONTENTS' WORK
     FILE EACH TIME A HEAD, SECT, INDEX, OR SKIP CONTROL WORD IS
     ENCOUNTERED.  ENTRIES IN THE TABLE OF CONTENTS INCLUDE THE PAGE
     NUMBER (ASSIGNED BY THE PROGRAM) AND THE HEADING GIVEN BY THE
     AUTHOR IN THE HEAD, SECT, INDEX, OR SKIP CARDS.
PARA AT PEOPLES NATIONAL BANK WE OBTAIN MULTIPLE COPIES USING JCL
IND-ARATHER THAN BY USING THE RDOC72 "COPY" CONTROL WORD AS DESCRIBED
IND-ABELOW.
PARA IF MULTIPLE COPIES HAVE BEEN SPECIFIED BY USING THE 'COPY'
     CONTROL WORD, EACH LINE GENERATED DURING THE FIRST PHASE IS
     STORED, IN PRINT FORMAT, IN A SECOND WORK FILE ON DISK.  RECORDS
     IN THE COPY FILE CON- SIST OF A ONE-CHARACTER CARRIAGE CONTROL
     CODE AND THE 132 CHARACTER LINE EXACTLY AS PRINTED DURING PHASE
     1.
PARA THE FIRST PHASE OF THE DOCUMENTATION PROGRAM ALSO PERFORMS AN
     EDIT ON ALL INPUT TO DETERMINE VALIDITY.  ERRORS IN INPUT FORMAT
     OR SEQUENCE ARE WRITTEN ONTO THE DIAGNOSTICS WORK FILE AND LATER
     A REPORT IS PREPARED.
PARA AFTER THE LAST INPUT CARD FOR A GIVEN BOOK HAS BEEN READ AND PRO-
     CESSED THE THREE WORK FILES ARE CLOSED AND THE SECOND PHASE
     BEGINS.  IN THE SECOND PHASE, THE DIAGNOSTICS FILE IS READ AND
     USED TO PRE- PARE A REPORT HEADED 'DIAGNOSTICS' (DESCRIBED IN A
     PREVIOUS SEC- TION).  FOLLOWING THE PRINTING OF THE DIAGNOSTICS
     REPORT, THE SEC- OND PHASE CONCLUDES BY GENERATING A TABLE OF
     CONTENTS (IF APPROPRIATE) FOR THE FIRST COPY OF DOCUMENTATION.
PARA THE THIRD PHASE OF THE DOCUMENTATION PROGRAM WILL BE USED ONLY IF
     MULTIPLE COPIES ARE REQUIRED FOR THE BOOK BEING PROCESSED.  PHASE
     THREE WILL PRODUCE A TABLE OF CONTENTS FOLLOWED BY A COPY OF THE
     NARRATIVE FOR EACH COPY REQUESTED IN EXCESS OF ONE.  WHEN THIS IS
     COMPLETED, CONTROL IS TURNED BACK TO PHASE ONE TO BEGIN THE NEXT
     BOOK.  IF THERE ARE NO MORE BOOKS TO BE PRINTED, THE JOB IS
     TERMI- NATED.

          THE DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM HAS FOUR OPERATIONAL MODES -
     NARRATIVE, LIST, REPORT, AND TITLE.  THE FUNCTIONS PERFORMED BY
     THE SYSTEM VARY CONSIDERABLY FROM ONE MODE TO ANOTHER IN ORDER TO
     PROVIDE THE AUTHOR WITH MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY.  BY SELECTING THE
     MOST SUITABLE MODE AND UTILIZING VARIOUS CONTROL WORDS, THE
     AUTHOR CAN CONTROL TO SUIT THE PARTICULAR REQUIREMENTS OF A GIVEN
     SITUATION SUCH PROCEDURES AS THE FORMATTING, SPACING, SKIPPING,
     PAGE HEADING, AND PAGE NUMBERING.
PARA      THE MODES OF OPERATION ARE DESCRIBED ON THE NEXT FEW PAGES.
     A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE CONTROL WORDS IS PRESENTED IN A
     LATER SECTION.
SINGL
HEAD NARRATIVE MODE
PARINTHE NARRATIVE MODE, WHICH IS MOST COMMONLY USED, IS DESIGNED FOR
     GENERAL DOCUMENTATION PURPOSES AND CONTAINS THE FULL RANGE OF
     CAPABILITIES AS DESCRIBED IN THE SECTION ON CONTROL WORDS.  IT IS
     USED FOR CREATING NARRATIVES IN PARAGRAPH FORM, OUTLINES, AND DE-
     TAILED LISTINGS (SUCH AS FILE DESCRIPTIONS, ETC.)  THIS BOOK WAS
     PRODUCED IN NARRATIVE MODE.
PARINREGARDLESS OF MODE, THE AUTHOR CAN EXERCISE AS MUCH OR AS LITTLE
     CONTROL OVER THE PRINTED DOCUMENTATION AS THE PARTICULAR
     SITUATION WARRANTS.  STANDARD OPTIONS (DESCRIBED IN THE SECTION
     TITLED 'DEFAULT OPTIONS') ARE DEFINED IN SUCH A WAY AS TO PROVIDE
     THE MOST OFTEN USED TECHNIQUES.  THE AUTHOR CAN OVERRIDE THESE
     STANDARD OPTIONS BY INSERTING THE APPROPRIATE CONTROL WORDS.
     SINCE ALL CONTROL WORDS ARE VALID IN NARRATIVE MODE AND CERTAIN
     RESTRICTIONS APPLY TO THEIR USE IN OTHER MODES, THERE IS A HIGHER
     DEGREE OF FLEXIBILITY AVAILABLE IN NARRATIVE MODE.
PARINDOCUMENTATION PRODUCED IN NARRATIVE MODE IS FORMATTED FOR
     PRINTING ON EIGHT AND ONE-HALF BY ELEVEN INCH PAPER.  THE MAXIMUM
     LENGTH OF A LINE OF DATA IS 70 CHARACTERS.  IF IT IS NECESSARY TO
     PRODUCE A LONGER LINE OF DATA, THE REPORT MODE MUST BE USED.
PARINSTANDARD OPTIONS IN THE NARRATIVE MODE INCLUDE AUTOMATIC PAGE
     HEADINGS, PAGE NUMBERING, AND TABLE OF CONTENTS.  GENERALLY,
     THESE ITEMS ARE NOT AVAILABLE (OR ARE SOMEWHAT RESTRICTED) IN THE
     REPORT AND TITLE MODES.
PARINTHE FORMAT FOR PUNCHED CARDS USED AS INPUT UNDER THE NARRATIVE
     MODE IS AS FOLLOWS--
SPAC1
IND-B 1-5 CONTROL WORD
IND-B 6-72 DATA TO BE PRINTED
IND-B 73-80 CARD SEQUENCE NUMBER
HEAD REPORT MODE
     THE DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM PROVIDES THE CAPABILITY OF PRINTING
     SAMPLE REPORTS BY OPERATING IN 'REPORT MODE'.  UPON RECOGNIZING
     THE CONTROL CARD REPRT, THE FUNCTIONS OF THE PROGRAM ARE
     SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGED.  INSTEAD OF PRINTING ONE LINE OF 67
     CHARACTERS FROM EACH CARD AS IN THE NARRATIVE MODE, THE PROGRAM
     WILL PRINT ONE LINE OF UP TO 132 CHAR- ACTERS COMING FROM TWO
     CARDS.  UPON ENTERING THE REPORT MODE, COLUMNS 6 TO 71 OF THE
     FIRST CARD ARE PLACED IN THE FIRST 66 CHARACTERS OF THE PRINT
     LINE.  COLUMNS 6 TO 71 OF THE SECOND CARD ARE PRINTED IN THE 66
     PRINT POSITIONS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SAME LINE.  THERE-
     AFTER, CARDS ARE ALTERNATELY PRINTED ON THE LEFT AND RIGHT HALVES
     OF THE FORM.  IF EITHER SIDE IS TO BE LEFT ENTIRELY BLANK, IT IS
     NECES- SARY TO INSERT A BLANK CARD AT THE APPROPRIATE POINT IN
     THE CARD DECK.
PARA THE FORMAT FOR PUNCHED CARDS USED AS INPUT UNDER THE REPORT MODE
     IS AS FOLLOWS--
SPAC1
IND-A 1- 5 CONTROL WORD
IND-A 6-71 DATA TO BE PRINTED
IND-A72    MUST CONTAIN A BLANK
IND-A73-80 CARD SEQUENCE NUMBER
PARA THE AUTHOR MAY INITIATE A CHANGE OF MODE AT ANY TIME (SEE CONTROL
     WORDS NARR,  LIST, AND TITLE).  IF DESIRED, A MESSAGE TO THE COM-
     PUTER OPERATOR CAN BE SPECIFIED, CAUSING THE SYSTEM TO STOP IN
     ORDER THAT THE OPERATOR MAY COMPLY WITH THE MESSAGE (SUCH AS A
     FORMS CHANGE WHEN ENTERING REPORT MODE.)  NOTE, HOWEVER, THAT IF
     MULTIPLE COPIES ARE BEING PRINTED THE MESSAGE STOP WILL OCCUR
     ONLY ON THE FIRST COPY.  FOR THIS REASON MULTIPLE COPIES OF
     REPORT SAM- PLES ON A DIFFERENT KIND OF PAPER MUST BE PRODUCED AS
     A SEPARATE RUN.
PARA WHEN OPERATING IN THE REPORT MODE, PAGE HEADINGS ARE NOT PRINTED
     AND ENTRIES TO THE TABLE OF CONTENTS ARE MADE ONLY THROUGH THE
     CONTROL WORD 'INDEX'.  PAGE NUMBERS, NORMALLY PART OF THE HEAD-
     INGS, ARE INCREMENTED AS USUAL BUT ARE NOT PRINTED.  PAGE NUM-
     BERS ARE INCREMENTED IN REPORT MODE SO THAT 'INDEX' ENTRIES IN
     THE TABLE OF CONTENTS WILL CONTAIN THE CORRECT PAGE NUMBER.
PARA SOME OF THE STANDARD CONTROL WORDS ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN THE RE-
     PORT MODE.  SINCE ALL OF THE CONTROL WORDS ARE DESCRIBED IN
     DETAIL IN A LATER SECTION, THE CONTROL WORDS AVAILABLE IN REPORT
     MODE ARE LISTED BELOW WITHOUT EXPLANATION.
PARA THE REPORT MODE IS NOT VALID WHEN CREATING A MAGNETIC TAPE WITH
     THE TWO-UP OPTION.

PARA IF ANY OTHER CONTROL WORDS ARE ENCOUNTERED WHILE IN REPORT MODE,
     THE CARD WILL BE BYPASSED AND AN ERROR MESSAGE 'CONTROL WORD
     INVALID IN REPORT MODE-BYPASSED.' WILL BE PRINTED ON THE
     DIAGNOSTICS LIST FOLLOWED BY AN IMAGE OF THE CARD.
HEAD TITLE MODE
PARINTHE TITLE MODE IS A COMBINATION OF SOME OF THE FEATURES OF THE
     NARRATIVE MODE AND THE REPORT MODE.  IT IS LIKE THE NARRATIVE
     MODE IN THAT ALL OF THE CONTROL WORDS (EXCEPT HEAD AND SECT) ARE
     VALID.  IT IS LIKE THE REPORT MODE IN THAT PAGE HEADINGS ARE NOT
     PRINTED AND THE NORMAL TABLE OF CONTENTS WILL NOT BE PREPARED
     UNLESS AN INDEX CONTROL WORD IS ENCOUNTERED.
PARINTITLE MODE CAN BE USED TO PRODUCE AN INTRODUCTORY MEMORANDUM EX-
     PLAINING THE PURPOSE OF THE NARRATIVE WHICH FOLLOWS.  REPORT
     SAMPLES WHICH ARE 67 CHARACTERS OR LESS COULD BE PRODUCED MORE
     EASILY IN TITLE MODE THAN REPORT MODE BECAUSE TITLE MODE PRINTS
     ONLY ONE CARD PER LINE.  IF, FOR EXAMPLE, THE AUTHOR WISHES TO
     PRODUCE A REPORT WHICH HAS PRINT LINES OF FIFTY CHARACTERS EACH,
     EVERY OTHER CARD WOULD HAVE TO BE LEFT BLANK TO USE THE REPORT
     MODE.
PARINWHATEVER PURPOSE THE AUTHOR INTENDS, HE MAY ENTER AND LEAVE THE
     TITLE MODE AT ANY TIME.  LIKE OTHER MODE CHANGES (REPRT, LIST,
     AND NARR) THE SYSTEM CAN BE STOPPED BY THE AUTHOR IF A MESSAGE TO
     THE COMPUTER OPERATOR IS DESIRED.
PARINAS IN THE REPORT MODE, PAGE NUMBERS ARE INCREMENTED IN TITLE MODE
     EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE NOT PRINTED.  IF THE AUTHOR WISHES,
     THEREFORE, TO HAVE A BOOK PRECEDED BY A THREE-PAGE COVER MEMO
     WHICH IS NOT TO BE INCLUDED IN THE PAGE NUMBERS, IT WOULD BE NEC-
     ESSARY TO SET THE PAGE NUMBER TO ONE AFTER PRINTING THE MEMORAN-
     DUM IN TITLE MODE BUT BEFORE PRINTING THE BOOK IN NARRATIVE MODE.
     THIS IS EASILY DONE BY ENTERING A 'PAGE' CONTROL WORD.
PARINTHE FORMAT FOR PUNCHED CARDS USED AS INPUT UNDER THE TITLE MODE
     IS AS FOLLOWS--
SPAC1
IND-B 1- 5 CONTROL WORD
IND-B 6-72 DATA TO BE PRINTED
IND-B73-80 CARD SEQUENCE NUMBER
HEAD LIST MODE
PARINTHE LIST MODE IS DESIGNED TO PRODUCE A LISTING OF THE EXACT IMAGE
     OF THE INPUT CARDS.  SINCE THE LISTING SHOWS ALL 80 CHARACTERS OF
     THE INPUT CARD, THE CARD SEQUENCE NUMBER AND THE CONTROL WORD
     WOULD BOTH BE PRINTED.  CARD SEQUENCE NUMBERS CAN ALSO BE PRINTED
     BY USING THE 'PRTPG' CONTROL WORD, BUT LIST MODE PROVIDES THE
     ONLY METHOD FOR THE PRINTING OF CONTROL WORDS.  BECAUSE OF ITS 80
     CHARACTER FORMAT, LIST MODE IS ALSO USEFUL IN PREPARING SAMPLE
     SCREEN DISPLAYS FOR DOCUMENT- ING SYSTEMS WHICH USE VIDEO
     TERMINALS.
PARINWHEN OPERATING IN THE LIST MODE, THE FOLLOWING CONTROL WORDS WILL
     CONTINUE TO FUNCTION EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED IN THE SECTION TITLED
     'CONTROL WORD SPECIFICATIONS'.  THEY ARE NOT PRINTED WHEN
     ENCOUNTERED.

PARINALL OTHER CONTROL WORDS ARE INOPERATIVE WHEN ENCOUNTERED IN LIST
     MODE.  THEY ARE PRINTED IN AN 80 CHARACTER IMAGE OF THE INPUT
     CARD.
PARINALTHOUGH THE FULL 80 CHARACTERS OF THE CARD MAY CONTAIN DATA IN
     THE LIST MODE, IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE SYSTEM WILL
     CONTINUE TO LOOK FOR THE ABOVE LISTED CONTROL WORDS IN THE
     CONTROL WORD FIELD.  IF COLUMNS 1 - 5 OF ANY RECORD CONTAIN A
     VALID CONTROL WORD FROM EITHER OF THE TWO LISTS, THE RECORD WILL
     BE TREATED ACCORDINGLY.
PARINDURING LIST MODE OPERATION, PRINTING OF PAGE HEADINGS IS SUSPEND-
     ED.  PAGE NUMBERS ARE NOT PRINTED, BUT THE PAGE COUNTER IS
     INCREMENTED AS USUAL WHEN SHEET EJECTION OCCURS.  NO ENTRIES ARE
     MADE IN THE TABLE OF CONTENTS.
SECT CONTROL WORDS
PARININ THIS SECTION THE VARIOUS CONTROL WORDS AVAILABLE TO THE AUTHOR
     ARE DISCUSSED IN DETAIL.  THE CONTROL WORDS MAY BE USED AT THE
     AUTHOR'S DISCRETION TO CONTROL SPACING, SKIPPING, HEADINGS, PAGE
     NUMBERING, ETC., OF THE PRINTED DOCUMENTATION.  ALTHOUGH THE LIST
     IS LENGTHY AND THE DESCRIPTIONS ARE, AT TIMES, RATHER COMPLEX,
     THE SYSTEM IS NOT DIFFICULT TO USE BECAUSE OF THE BUILT-IN
     OPTIONS DESCRIBED IN A LATER SECTION.  IN FACT, THE VAST MAJORITY
     OF DATA CARDS IN AN AVERAGE BOOK HAVE NO CONTROL WORD AT ALL.
     GENERALLY, CONTROL WORDS ARE USED TO OVERRIDE NORMAL PROCEDURES.
     THE ONLY CONTROL WORD ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED IS 'BOOK' TO INDICATE
     THE FIRST CARD OF EACH BOOK.
PARINTHE CONTROL WORD, WHERE APPLICABLE, IS PUNCHED IN COLUMNS SIX TO
     TEN OF THE INPUT CARD.  SOME OF THE CONTROL WORDS DO NOT REQUIRE
     THE FULL FIVE POSITIONS.  IN THIS CASE, THE REMAINDER OF THE CON-
     TROL WORD FIELD MUST BE LEFT BLANK WITH THE DATA BEGINNING IN
     COL- UMN ELEVEN.
PARINSOME OF THE CONTROL WORDS HAVE RESTRICTIONS AS TO THE CONTENT OF
     THE DATA FIELD IN THE CARDS.  ADDITIONALLY, SOME OF THE CONTROL
     WORDS ARE VALID ONLY IN CERTAIN MODES.  OTHERS MUST PRECEDE THE
     FIRST CARD WHICH WOULD CAUSE A LINE TO BE PRINTED.  WHERE SUCH
     RESTRICTIONS APPLY, THEY ARE DESCRIBED UNDER THE APPROPRIATE CON-
     TROL WORD.
PARINFOR EASE OF FUTURE REFERENCE, THE CONTROL WORDS ARE LISTED
     ALPHABETICALLY.  REFERENCE IS NOT MADE TO LIST MODE WHEN EACH
     CONTROL WORD IS DISCUSSED BECAUSE ALL CONTROL WORDS ARE VALID -
     THEY ARE JUST NOT NECESSARILY OPERATIONAL.  (SEE DOCUMENTATION
     PRINTING MODES- LIST MODE.)
HEAD CONTROL WORD SPECIFICATIONS
INDEX* BKHED - SUPPRESS BOOK HEADINGS
IND-ATHE BKHED CONTROL WORD SUPPRESSES THE NORMAL PRINTING OF BOOK
IND-ANAMES AND NUMBERS AS THE FIRST LINE OF HEADINGS ON EACH PAGE.
IND-ANORMALLY, BOOK HEADINGS WILL APPEAR AS THE FIRST LINE OF EACH
IND-APAGE UNLESS THE BOOK CARD IS BLANK IN COLUMNS 6-72.  BKHED
IND-AOVERRIDES THIS CONDITION AND SUPPRESSES BOOK HEADINGS FOR THE
IND-AREMAINDER OF THE BOOK.
PARINMAY BE USED AT THE DISCRETION OF THE AUTHOR AT ANY POINT IN
IND-ATHE DATA, CAUSING SUPPRESSION OF BOOK HEADING FROM THAT POINT
IND-ATO THE END OF THE BOOK.  MAY NOT CONTAIN DATA IN THE NARRATIVE
IND-AFIELD - MUST BE BLANK IN COLUMNS 6-72.
INDEX* BKNUM - SUPPRESS PRINTING OF BOOK NUMBER
IND-ATHE BKNUM CONTROL WORD SUPPRESSES THE NORMAL PRINTING OF BOOK
IND-ANUMBERS IN THE BOOK HEADING LINE ON EACH PAGE.  DOES NOT AFFECT
IND-APRINTING OF BOOK NAMES.  NORMALLY, BOOK HEADINGS SHOWING BOTH
IND-ABOOK NAME AND BOOK NUMBER ARE PRINTED AT THE TOP OF EACH PAGE.
IND-ABKNUM ALLOWS THE PRINTING OF BOOK NAME BUT SUPPRESSES THE BOOK
IND-ANUMBER.
PARINMAY BE USED AT THE DISCRETION OF THE AUTHOR AT ANY POINT IN
IND-ATHE DATA, CAUSING SUPPRESSION OF BOOK NUMBER FROM THAT POINT
IND-ATO THE END OF THE BOOK.  MAY NOT CONTAIN DATA IN THE NARRATIVE
IND-AFIELD - MUST BE BLANK IN COLUMNS 6-72.
PARINBKNUM DIFFERS FROM BKHED IN THAT BKHED SUPPRESSES BOTH BOOK
IND-ANAME AND BOOK NUMBER WHEREAS BKNUM SUPPRESSES BOOK NUMBER ONLY.
INDEX* BOOK  - FIRST CARD OF EACH BOOK IN THE LIBRARY
IND-ATHE BOOK CARD IS USED TO INDICATE THE BEGINNING OF A BOOK WHEN
IND-AMULTIPLE BOOKS ARE BEING PRINTED.  IT WILL CAUSE THE SYSTEM TO
IND-ASUSPEND READING OF INPUT TEMPORARILY.  A TABLE OF CONTENTS FOR
IND-ATHE PRECEEDING BOOK WILL BE PRINTED UNLESS SUPPRESSED BY A NOTAB
IND-ACARD (SEE CONTROL WORD NOTAB), OR UNLESS THE DATA IN THE PREVIOUS
IND-ABOOK WAS SUCH THAT NO ENTRIES IN THE TABLE OF CONTENTS WERE MADE.
IND-AIF MULTIPLE COPIES WERE SPECIFIED, THE REMAINING COPIES OF THE
IND-APREVIOUS BOOK WILL THEN BE PRINTED (ALONG WITH ADDITIONAL TABLES
IND-AOF CONTENTS IF APPROPRIATE).  THE SYSTEM IS THEN RE-INITIALIZED
IND-ABY TURNING OFF INTERNAL PROGRAM INDICATORS AND RESETTING PAGE
IND-ANUMBER COUNTERS, ETC.
PARINTHE BOOK NAME AND BOOK NUMBER FROM THE BOOK CONTROL CARD ARE THEN
IND-ASTORED FOR PAGE HEADING PURPOSES AND NORMAL PROCESSING OF INPUT
IND-ADATA IS RESUMED.  ALTHOUGH A 'BOOK' CARD MUST BE THE FIRST CARD
IND-AOF EVERY BOOK, IT DOES NOT HAVE TO CONTAIN A BOOK NAME.  IF A
IND-ABOOK NAME IS PRESENT IN CARD COLUMNS 6-60, THE BOOK NAME AND THE
IND-ABOOK NUMBER WILL BE PRINTED AS THE FIRST HEADING LINE ON EACH
IND-APAGE OF THE FINISHED DOCUMENTATION (UNLESS SUPPRESSED BY A BKHED
IND-AOR BKNUM CONTROL WORD).  IF COLUMNS 6 TO 60 OF THE HEAD CARD ARE
IND-ALEFT BLANK, THE HEADING LINE FOR BOOK NAME AND NUMBER ON EACH
IND-APAGE WILL BE OMITTED.
PARINIF THE MODE OF OUTPUT IS TAPE, EACH BOOK WILL CREATE ONE FILE ON
IND-ATHE TAPE.
PARINTHE FORMAT FOR THE 'BOOK' CARD IS--

PARA      COLUMN HEADING CARDS ARE USED TO SUPPLY UP TO THREE LINES OF
          HEADINGS SUBORDINATE TO BOOK, SECTION, AND HEAD CARD
          HEADINGS.  THE COLM1 CARD SETS UP THE FIRST LINE, COLM2 SETS
          UP THE SECOND, AND COLM3 SETS UP THE THIRD.  WHEN A COLUMN
          HEADING CARD IS EN- COUNTERED, THE NARRATIVE PORTION IS
          PRINTED AND STORED FOR USE IN THE APPROPRIATE HEADING LINE
          WHEN PAGE OVERFLOW OCCURS.  IF THE NARRATIVE PORTION OF THE
          COLUMN HEADING CARD IS BLANK, IT IS USED TO BLANK OUT THE
          APPROPRIATE HEADING LINE.
PARA      WHEN PAGE OVERFLOW OCCURS, THE BOOK, SECTION, AND/OR HEAD
          CARD HEADINGS ARE PRINTED ACCORDING TO SPECIFICATIONS
          PROVIDED BY OTHER CONTROL WORDS.  A BLANK LINE AUTOMATICALLY
          FOLLOWS THE HEAD CARD HEADING LINE.  IF ONE OR MORE LINES OF
          COLUMN HEADINGS HAVE BEEN SPECIFIED, THEY WILL THEN BE
          PRINTED.
PARA      COLUMN HEADINGS MAY BE BLANKED OUT BY USING THE APPROPRIATE
          'COLM ' CONTROL WORD WITH A BLANK NARRATIVE FIELD.  THEY ARE
          BLANKED OUT AUTOMATICALLY WHEN A BOOK, SECTION, OR HEAD CARD
          IS ENCOUNTERED.  COLUMN HEADING CARDS ARE VALID IN NARRATIVE
          MODE ONLY.  BYPASSED IF ENCOUNTERED IN OTHER MODES.

IND-AWITH THE NEXT CARD AND CONTINUE UNTIL A SINGL CARD IS READ.  THE
IND-ADOUBL CARD MAY NOT CONTAIN NARRATIVE AND MUST BE BLANK IN COLUMNS
IND-A06 TO 72.  IF THIS CARD IS OMITTED, SINGLE SPACING IS ASSUMED.
IND-ANORMAL SPACING IS AUTOMATICALLY CHANGED TO SINGLE SPACE WHEN A
IND-AMODE CHANGE IS PROCESSED (CONTROL WORD 'NARR, REPRT, OR TITLE'.)
INDEX* EJECT - SHEET EJECTION
IND-AWILL CAUSE THE COMPUTER TO EJECT THE SHEET BEING PRINTED AND RE-
IND-ASUME PRINTING AT THE TOP OF THE NEXT PAGE.  THE NEXT PAGE WILL
IND-ACONTAIN STANDARD PAGE HEADINGS ACCORDING TO THE OPTIONS SPECIFIED
IND-AIN OTHER CONTROL WORDS.  THE 'EJECT' CARD MAY BE USED AT ANY
IND-APOINT IN THE DATA REGARDLESS OF MODE.
PARINIF 'EJECT' CARDS ARE NOT USED, SHEET EJECTION WILL OCCUR AUTOMAT-
IND-AICALLY WHEN THE SPECIFIED NUMBER OF LINES HAVE BEEN PRINTED OR
IND-AWHEN A 'SECT' OR 'HEAD' CARD IS ENTERED.  THE 'EJECT' CARD MAY
IND-ANOT CONTAIN NARRATIVE AND MUST BE BLANK IN COLUMNS 06 TO 72.
INDEX* ENSUB - END OF SUB-PAGE NUMBERING
IND-AUSED TO INDICATE THAT SUB-PAGE NUMBERING STARTED BY A 'SUBPG'
IND-ACARD SHOULD BE ENDED AND NORMAL PAGE NUMBERING SHOULD RESUME.
IND-AMAY BE USED AT ANY TIME REGARDLESS OF MODE.  ALTHOUGH PAGE NUM-
IND-ABERS ARE NOT PRINTED IN THE REPORT OR TITLE MODES, THE PAGE NUM-
IND-ABER COUNTER IS INCREMENTED FOR EACH PAGE PRINTED.  THIS MEANS
IND-ATHAT IF A BOOK IS BEING PRINTED IN NARRATIVE MODE AND CHANGED TO
IND-APRINT TWO PAGES IN REPORT OR TITLE MODE, THE PAGE NUMBER ON THE
IND-ANEXT PAGE OF NARRATIVE WOULD REFLECT THE TWO PAGE GAP.  IF THE
IND-AAUTHOR DOES NOT WISH TO HAVE SUCH A GAP, HE COULD ENTER A 'SUBPG'
IND-ACARD JUST BEFORE ENTERING REPORT OR TITLE MODE AND AN ENSUB CARD
IND-AJUST BEFORE RE-ENTRY INTO NARRATIVE MODE.  THIS WOULD CAUSE THE
IND-ASUB-PAGE NUMBER TO BE INCREMENTED INSTEAD OF THE PAGE NUMBER SO
IND-ATHAT THE NARRATIVE PAGES PRECEEDING AND FOLLOWING THE TWO REPORT
IND-AOR TITLE MODE PAGES WOULD BE NUMBERED CONSECUTIVELY WITH NO GAP.
PARINTHE 'ENSUB' CARD DOES NOT CAUSE SHEET EJECTION.  IT MAY NOT CON-
IND-ATAIN NARRATIVE AND MUST BE BLANK IN COLUMNS 06 TO 72.
INDEX* HEAD  - PAGE HEADINGS
IND-ASUPPLIES HEADING LINES UNDER THE BOOK AND SECTION HEADING LINES
IND-A(IF ANY).  CAUSES SHEET EJECTION TO OCCUR.  FOLLOWING THE SHEET
IND-AEJECTION, THE NEW PAGE WILL BE HEADED WITH BOOK NAME (UNLESS LEFT
IND-ABLANK IN THE 'BOOK' CARD), THE SECTION NAME (UNLESS 'SECT' CARDS
IND-AARE OMITTED OR CONTAIN BLANKS IN THE SECTION NAME FIELD, AND THE
IND-AHEADING PROVIDED IN THE 'HEAD' CARD.  'HEAD' CARDS ARE STORED AND
IND-APRINTED ON THE TOP OF EACH PAGE UNTIL ANOTHER 'HEAD' CARD, A
IND-A'SECT' CARD, OR A 'BOOK' CARD IS ENCOUNTERED.  VALID ONLY IN THE
IND-ANARRATIVE MODE.  BYPASSED IN TITLE MODE OR REPORT MODE.  IF THE
IND-A'NOHED' OPTION HAS BEEN SPECIFIED, 'HEAD' CARDS WILL CAUSE SHEET
IND-AEJECTION ONLY - NO HEADINGS WILL BE PRINTED.
PARINUNLESS THE 'NOHED' OR 'NOTAB' OPTIONS HAVE BEEN SPECIFIED, THE
IND-AHEADING WILL ALSO BE ENTERED INTO THE TABLE OF CONTENTS ALONG
IND-AWITH THE PAGE NUMBER UPON WHICH IT FIRST APPEARS.
PARINWHEN A 'SECT' CARD IS ENTERED, THE STORED HEADING WILL BE BLANKED
IND-AOUT.  THE HEADING LINE FOR 'HEAD' CARDS WILL CONTAIN ONLY THE
IND-APAGE NUMBER AND THE DATE UNTIL ANOTHER 'HEAD' CARD IS ENTERED.

INDEX* INDEX - SPECIAL ENTRY TO TABLE OF CONTENTS
IND-ACAUSES THE DATA APPEARING IN COLUMNS 6 TO 65 TO BE PRINTED IN
IND-ATHE NARRATIVE WITH AN AUTOMATIC * IN THE SECOND POSITION TO THE
IND-ALEFT OF THE CARD DATA.  ALSO CAUSES TWO BLANK LINES TO BE LEFT
IND-ABEFORE PRINTING THE CONTENTS OF COLUMNS 6 TO 65 WITH ONE BLANK
IND-ALINE AFTER PRINTING.  ALSO CAUSES AN ENTRY TO BE MADE IN THE
IND-ATABLE OF CONTENTS UNLESS 'NOTAB' OR 'NOHED' OPTIONS HAVE BEEN
IND-ASPECIFIED.
PARINTHE PURPOSE OF THE 'INDEX' CARD IS TO PROVIDE SUB-TITLES IN THE
IND-ANARRATIVE AND TABLE OF CONTENTS ENTRIES WITHOUT THE SHEET EJEC-
IND-ATION CAUSED BY USING THE CONTROL WORD 'HEAD'.  THE 'INDEX' CARD
IND-ADOES NOT REPLACE THE STORED HEADING WHICH WILL BE PRINTED IF
IND-ANORMAL OVERFLOW OCCURS.  AN EXAMPLE OF THE USE OF THE 'INDEX'
IND-ACONTROL WORD FOLLOWS.  ASSUME THAT A GIVEN WRITE-UP CONTAINS A
IND-ADESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTIONS UNDER THE HEADING 'TRANSACTIONS' AND
IND-ATHAT THERE ARE TEN TRANSACTIONS WITH ONE PARAGRAPH DESCRIBING
IND-AEACH TRANSACTION.  IF 'HEAD' CARDS WERE USED FOR THE NAME OF EACH
IND-ATRANSACTION, THERE WOULD BE AN ENTRY IN THE TABLE OF CONTENTS
IND-ASHOWING THE LOCATION OF EACH TRANSACTION BUT THE NARRATIVE WOULD
IND-ACONTAIN A SEPARATE PAGE FOR EACH TRANSACTION.  THE BETTER ALTER-
IND-ANATIVE WOULD BE TO USE THE 'HEAD' CONTROL WORD FOR THE GENERAL
IND-ATITLE 'TRANSACTIONS' AND THE 'INDEX' CONTROL WORD FOR THE INDI-
IND-AVIDUAL TRANSACTION NAMES.  THE TABLE OF CONTENTS WOULD THEN SHOW
IND-ATHE GENERAL TITLE 'TRANSACTIONS' AND, UNDER THAT, AN ENTRY FOR
IND-ATHE NAME OF EACH TRANSACTION.  IN THE NARRATIVE, TRANSACTION
IND-ANAMES AND DESCRIPTIONS WOULD APPEAR ONE AFTER ANOTHER WITHOUT
IND-ASHEET EJECTION AND ALL UNDER THE GENERAL HEADING 'TRANSACTIONS'.
PARA      IN DOCUMENTS HAVING MANY SUB-TITLES, THE AUTHOR MAY WISH TO
          AVOID THE POSSIBILITY OF HAVING A SUB-TITLE (INDEX CONTROL
          WORD) APPEAR AS THE LAST LINE ON A PAGE WITH THE DESCRIPTIVE
          NARRATIVE ON THE FOLLOWING PAGE.  IF SO, THE AUTHOR MAY
          SPECIFY IN AN 'XLINE' CARD THAT PAGE OVERFLOW IS TO BE
          FORCED WHEN AN INDEX CARD IS ENCOUNT- ERED AFTER A CERTAIN
          NUMBER OF LINES HAVE BEEN PRINTED ON A PAGE.  SEE ALSO
          'XLINE - INDEX LINES LIMIT.'
PARINTHE 'INDEX' CONTROL WORD WILL BE TREATED AS DESCRIBED ABOVE IF
IND-AENCOUNTERED IN THE NARRATIVE OR TITLE MODES.  IN THE REPORT MODE,
IND-AAN ENTRY WILL BE MADE TO THE TABLE OF CONTENTS (UNLESS 'NOHED'
IND-AOR 'NOTAB' HAVE BEEN SPECIFIED) BUT THE 'INDEX' CARD WILL NOT BE
IND-APRINTED.  THIS CONTROL WORD PROVIDES THE ONLY METHOD FOR MAKING
IND-AA TABLE OF CONTENTS ENTRY IN THE TITLE AND REPORT MODES.  CONTROL
IND-AWORDS 'HEAD' AND 'SECT' ARE BYPASSED EXCEPT IN NARRATIVE MODE.
INDEX* LINES - NUMBER OF LINES PER PAGE
IND-AUSED TO INDICATE THE NUMBER OF LINES, INCLUDING HEADINGS AND
IND-ASPACES, TO BE PRINTED ON EACH PAGE.  MAXIMUM NUMBER OF LINES
IND-AWHICH MAY BE SPECIFIED IS 66.  THE 'LINES' CARD MAY BE ENTERED
IND-AAT ANY POINT IN THE DATA REGARDLESS OF MODE.  WHEN A 'LINES'
IND-ACARD IS ENCOUNTERED, THE SYSTEM DETERMINES WHETHER THE NUMBER
IND-AOF LINES SPECIFIED HAVE BEEN PRINTED ON THE PRESENT PAGE.  IF
IND-ASO, THE PRESENT PAGE IS EJECTED IMMEDIATELY.  ALL PAGES FOLLOWING
IND-AWILL CONTAIN THE SPECIFIED NUMBER OF LINES UNTIL A NEW 'LINES'
IND-ACARD IS ENCOUNTERED.  CONTROL WORDS 'EJECT, HEAD, AND SECT' WILL
IND-ACAUSE SHEET EJECTION WHEN ENCOUNTERED WITHOUT AFFECTING OR BEING
          AFFECTED BY THE 'LINES' CONTROL WORD.  AN 'INDEX' CARD WILL
          CAUSE SHEET EJECTION TO OCCUR WHEN ENCOUNTERED IF THE NUMBER
          OF LINES PRINTED EXCEEDS THE LIMIT SPECIFIED IN THE 'XLINE'
          CARD.

          CHANGE IS REQUIRED OR IF THE AUTHOR WISHES TO CONVEY SOME
          MESSAGE TO THE COMPUTER OPERATOR, THE DESIRED MESSAGE MAY BE
          PLACED IN COLUMNS 06 TO 72 OF THE LIST CARD.  THIS CAUSES A
          THREE LINE MESSAGE TO APPEAR ON THE CONSOLE.  THE FIRST LINE
          READS 'NOW CHANGING TO LIST MODE', THE SECOND LINE CONTAINS
          THE MESSAGE FROM COLUMNS 06 TO 72 OF THE LIST CARD, AND THE
          THIRD LINE READS 'EOB TO CONTINUE'.
PARINIF THE 'LIST' CARD IS BLANK IN COLUMNS 06 TO 72, THE MODE CHANGE
IND-AAND SPACING CHANGE WILL OCCUR BUT NO MESSAGE WILL BE PRINTED AND

IND-AANY POINT IN THE DATA REGARDLESS OF MODE.  CAUSES AN AUTOMATIC
IND-ACHANGE TO SINGLE SPACING.  IF A PAPER CHANGE IS REQUIRED OR IF
IND-ATHE AUTHOR WISHES TO CONVEY SOME MESSAGE TO THE COMPUTER OPER-
IND-AATOR, THE DESIRED MESSAGE MAY BE PLACED IN COLUMNS 06 TO 72 OF
IND-ATHE 'NARR' CARD.  THIS WILL CAUSE A THREE LINE MESSAGE TO APPEAR
IND-AON THE CONSOLE.  THE FIRST LINE READS 'NOW CHANGING TO NARRATIVE
IND-AMODE.'  THE SECOND LINE WILL CONTAIN THE MESSAGE FROM COLUMNS 06
IND-ATO 72 OF THE 'NARR' CARD.  THE THIRD LINE READS 'EOB TO CONTINUE.
PARINIF THE 'NARR' CARD IS BLANK IN COLUMNS 06 TO 72, THE MODE CHANGE
IND-AAND SPACING CHANGE WILL OCCUR BUT NO MESSAGE WILL BE PRINTED AND

INDEX* NOHED - NO HEADINGS DESIRED
IND-ACAUSES THE ELIMINATION OF ALL LEVELS OF HEADINGS AND OF TABLE OF
IND-ACONTENTS.  THE 'NOHED' CARD MAY NOT CONTAIN NARRATIVE AND MUST BE
IND-ABLANK IN COLUMNS 06 TO 72.  VALID IN ANY MODE BUT PROBABLY NOT
IND-ANECESSARY IN REPORT OR TITLE MODE.  BOTH OF THESE MODES AUTOMAT-
IND-AICALLY SUPPRESS PRINTING OF HEADINGS AND WILL NOT MAKE ENTRIES
IND-ATO THE TABLE OF CONTENTS EXCEPT FOR 'INDEX' CARDS.
PARINTHE 'NOHED' CARD MUST PRECEDE THE FIRST CARD WHICH WOULD CAUSE A
IND-ALINE TO BE PRINTED IN EACH BOOK.  IF NOT, THE 'NOHED' CARD WILL
IND-ABE BYPASSED AND AN ERROR MESSAGE WILL BE PRINTED ON THE DIAGNOS-
IND-ATICS REPORT.

IND-AWHILE THE 'NOTAB' CONTROL WORD SUPPRESSES ONLY THE TABLE OF CON-
IND-ATENTS.
INDEX* NOTAB - NO TABLE OF CONTENTS DESIRED
IND-AUSED TO ELIMINATE THE TABLE OF CONTENTS.  DOES NOT INTERFERE WITH
IND-ANORMAL PAGE HEADINGS SPECIFIED IN OTHER CONTROL WORDS.  VALID IN
IND-AANY MODE BUT PROBABLY NOT NECESSARY IF ENTIRE BOOK IS TO BE PRO-
IND-ADUCED IN REPORT OR TITLE MODE.  BOTH OF THESE MODES RESTRICT THE
IND-ATABLE OF CONTENTS TO 'INDEX' CONTROL WORDS.  IF NO 'INDEX' CARDS
IND-AARE PRESENT, NO TABLE ENTRIES WILL BE MADE AND, THEREFORE, THE
IND-ATABLE OF CONTENTS WILL NOT BE PRINTED.  CAN BE USED IN NARRATIVE
IND-AMODE OR MIXED MODES TO SUPPRESS THE TABLE OF CONTENTS EVEN THOUGH
IND-ATHE DATA WOULD NORMALLY CAUSE ONE TO BE PRODUCED.
PARINTHE 'NOTAB' CARD MUST PRECEDE THE FIRST CARD WHICH WOULD CAUSE A
IND-ALINE TO BE PRINTED FOR EACH BOOK.  IF NOT, IT WILL BE BYPASSED
IND-AAND AN ERROR MESSAGE WILL BE PRINTED ON THE DIAGNOSTICS REPORT.

IND-ACANNOT BE NEGATED UNTIL ANOTHER 'BOOK' CARD IS ENTERED.
INDEX* PAGE  - SET PAGE NUMBER
IND-ANORMALLY, PAGE NUMBERING AUTOMATICALLY BEGINS AT ONE FOR EACH
IND-ABOOK AND CONTINUES CONSECUTIVELY.  IF THE AUTHOR WISHES, HOWEVER,
IND-AHE MAY SET THE PAGE NUMBER TO A SPECIFIC VALUE AT THE BEGINNING
IND-AOF A BOOK OR AT ANY POINT DURING THE RUN BY USING A 'PAGE' CARD.
IND-ATHIS FEATURE MIGHT BE USED, FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN ONLY A FEW SELECTED
IND-APAGES OF A LARGE BOOK HAVE BEEN CHANGED AND REQUIRE REPRINTING.
IND-ABY ENTERING A 'PAGE' CARD BEFORE SHEET EJECTION OCCURS, THE NUM-
IND-ABER SPECIFIED WILL BE USED FOR THE NEXT PAGE PRINTED.
PARINALTHOUGH PAGE NUMBERS ARE NOT PRINTED DURING THE REPORT OR TITLE
IND-AMODES, THE PAGE NUMBER COUNTER IS INCREMENTED IN ORDER THAT EN-
IND-ATRIES CAN BE MADE IN THE TABLE OF CONTENTS BY USING AN 'INDEX'
IND-ACONTROL WORD IF DESIRED.  'PAGE' IS VALID IN ALL MODES.
PARINIF SUB-PAGE NUMBERING HAS BEEN SPECIFIED AND HAS NOT BEEN ENDED
IND-AWHEN A 'PAGE' CARD IS ENCOUNTERED, SUB-PAGE NUMBERING WILL BE
IND-ADISCONTINUED AND THE SPECIFIED NUMBER ENTERED INTO THE PAGE NUM-
IND-ABER COUNTER.  IF THE AUTHOR WISHES TO CHANGE NUMBERING FROM ONE
IND-ASUB-PAGE TO ANOTHER SUB-PAGE, THIS MUST BE DONE BY USING THE CON-
IND-ATROL WORD 'SUBPG' RATHER THAN 'PAGE'.  IF HE WISHES TO SUSPEND
IND-ASUB-PAGE NUMBERING WITHOUT RELOADING THE PAGE NUMBER THIS MUST
IND-ABE DONE BY USING THE 'ENSUB' CARD.
PARINTHE 'PAGE' CARD MUST CONTAIN THE DESIRED PAGE NUMBER IN COLUMNS
IND-A11 TO 14 (NUMERIC ONLY - ZERO FILLED TO LEFT IF NECESSARY).  CARD

PARA      THE DOCUMENTATION SYSTEM HAS THE CAPABILITY OF STORING UP TO
          NINE 67 CHARACTER PARAGRAPH LABELS.  THE DESIRED LABELS ARE
          CREATED AND DELETED THROUGH THE USE OF CONTROL WORDS 'SAVE1'
          THROUGH 'SAVE9'.  ONCE ESTABLISHED BY THE 'SAVE ' CONTROL
          WORDS, THEY MAY BE CALLED FOR AS NEEDED BY USING THE 'PLAB '
          CONTROL WORDS.
PARA      WHEN A 'PLAB ' CARD WITH A NUMERIC DIGIT IN THE LAST
          POSITION OF THE CONTROL WORD IS ENCOUNTERED, THE SYSTEM WILL
          PRINT THE PARAGRAPH LABEL STORED BY A 'SAVE ' CARD WITH THE
          CORRESPONDING NUMBER.  THE LINE FOLLOWING THE PRINTED
          PARAGRAPH LABEL WOULD BE PRINTED WITH THE DATA CONTAINED IN

PARA      PARAGRAPH LABEL CARDS WITH AN ALPHABETIC CHARACTER (A
          THROUGH I) IN THE LAST POSITION OF THE CONTROL WORD REFER TO
          THE SAME NINE PARAGRAPH LABELS AS THE DIGITS 1 THROUGH 9
          RESPECTIVELY.  THE USE OF AN ALPHABETIC CHARACTER WILL CAUSE
          THE SAME RESULT AS A NUMER- IC DIGIT EXCEPT THAT THE
          PRINTING OF THE PARAGRAPH LABEL IS PRE- CEDED BY A BLANK
          LINE.
PARA      IF THE NARRATIVE PORTION OF A PARAGRAPH LABEL IS BLANK, THE
          SYS- TEM WILL PRINT THE STORED PARAGRAPH LABEL AS DESCRIBED
          ABOVE BUT WILL NOT GENERATE A NARRATIVE LINE FOLLOWING THE

IND-ATHE INPUT DATA WILL BE PRINTED.
PARINTHE PRTPG CONTROL WORD MAY BE USED AT ANY TIME REGARDLESS OF THE
IND-AMODE OF OPERATION.  SINCE REPORT MODE USES ALL 132 PRINTING POSI-
IND-ATIONS, HOWEVER, THE PRTPG CONTROL WORD WILL NOT BECOME EFFECTIVE
IND-AUNTIL NARRATIVE OR TITLE MODE IS ENTERED.  SEQUENCE NUMBERS WILL
IND-ATHEN BE PRINTED FROM THAT POINT TO THE END OF THE BOOK.  PRINTING

IND-ACOULD REQUEST THAT THE OPERATOR REMOVE ONE PRE-PRINTED FORM AND
IND-AINSERT ANOTHER BY USING MULTIPLE REPRT CARDS AT THE APPROPRIATE
IND-APLACES.
PARINREPRT, LIKE OTHER MODE CHANGES (NARR AND TITLE), CAUSES AN AUTO-
IND-AMATIC CHANGE TO SINGLE SPACING BUT DOES NOT CAUSE SHEET EJECTION.
IND-AIF DOUBLE SPACING IS DESIRED, THE AUTHOR MUST INSERT A 'DOUBL'
IND-ACARD AFTER A MODE CHANGE.  IF 'PRTPG' HAS BEEN SPECIFIED PRIOR TO
IND-AENTERING REPORT MODE, THAT OPTION IS AUTOMATICALLY CANCELLED AS
IND-ATHE REPORT MODE USES ALL 132 PRINTING POSITIONS.  REPORT MODE IS
IND-ANOT VALID WHEN THE TWO-UP MODE OF OUTPUT OPTION IS IN FORCE.

          CAUSE AUTOMATIC SHEET EJECTION.  IF THE AUTHOR DOES NOT
          INTEND TO PROVIDE TRANSI- TIONAL INTRODUCTORY MATERIAL AT
          THE BEGINNING OF A SECTION, THE CONTROL WORD 'SECTN' SHOULD
          BE USED INSTEAD OF 'SECT'.
PARINSECT CARDS ARE VALID ONLY IN NARRATIVE MODE AND WILL BE BYPASSED
IND-AIF ENCOUNTERED IN REPORT MODE OR TITLE MODE.  IF THE NOHED OPTION
IND-AHAS BEEN SPECIFIED, SECT CARDS WILL CAUSE SHEET EJECTION ONLY.
PARINTHE FORMAT FOR 'SECT' CARDS IS--

IND-BCC. 73-80 CARD SEQUENCE NUMBER (OPTIONAL)
INDEX* SECTN - BEGINNING OF SECTION WITH NO SHEET EJECTION
          THE CONTROL WORD 'SECTN' INDICATES THE BEGINNING OF A NEW
          SECTION OF THE BOOK.  ITS FUNCTION IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS
          THE 'SECT' CON- TROL WORD EXCEPT THAT IT DOES NOT CAUSE AN
          AUTOMATIC SHEET EJECT TO OCCUR AND, THUS, DOES NOT PROVIDE
          FOR AN INTRODUCTION TO THE NEW SECTION.  'SECTN' CARDS ARE
          NOT PRINTED WHEN ENCOUNTERED.  THE NEW SECTION HEADING
          PROVIDED BY THE 'SECTN' CONTROL WORD WILL APPEAR ON THE NEXT
          PAGE PRINTED.  MOST OFTEN, THIS WILL OCCUR WHEN A 'HEAD'
          CARD IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWS THE 'SECTN' CARD.
PARA      REFER TO CONTROL WORD 'SECT' FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE
          USE OF HEADINGS, SECTIONS, AND INTRODUCTIONS.
INDEX* SEHED - SUPPRESS SECTION HEADINGS
IND-ATHE SEHED CONTROL WORD SUPPRESSES THE NORMAL PRINTING OF SECTION
IND-ANAMES AND NUMBERS AS THE SECOND LINE OF HEADINGS ON EACH PAGE.
IND-ANORMALLY, SECTION NAMES AND NUMBERS ARE PRINTED IF THEY APPEAR
IND-AIN THE SECTION CARDS ENTERED IN THE DATA.  SEHED SUPPRESSES ANY
IND-ASECTION NAMES AND NUMBERS WHICH MAY BE IN THE DATA.
PARINMAY BE USED AT THE DISCRETION OF THE AUTHOR AT ANY POINT IN THE
IND-ADATA, CAUSING SUPPRESSION OF THE SECTION HEADING LINE FROM THAT
IND-APOINT TO THE END OF THE BOOK.  MAY NOT CONTAIN DATA IN THE NAR-
IND-ARATIVE FIELD - MUST BE BLANK IN COLUMNS 11-80.
INDEX* SENUM - SUPPRESS PRINTING OF SECTION NUMBERS
IND-ATHE SENUM CONTROL WORD SUPPRESSES THE NORMAL PRINTING OF SECTION
IND-ANUMBERS IN THE SECTION HEADING LINE ON EACH PAGE.  DOES NOT AF-
IND-AFECT PRINTING OF SECTION NAMES.  NORMALLY, SECTION HEADINGS WITH
IND-ABOTH SECTION NAME AND SECTION NUMBER ARE PRINTED AS THE SECOND
IND-ALINE OF HEADINGS ON EACH PAGE IF SECTION CARDS ARE PRESENT IN THE
IND-AINPUT DATA.  SENUM WILL ALLOW THE PRINTING OF SECTION NAMES BUT
IND-ASUPPRESS SECTION NUMBERS.
PARINMAY BE USED AT THE DISCRETION OF THE AUTHOR AT ANY POINT IN THE
IND-ADATA, CAUSING SUPPRESSION OF SECTION NUMBERS FROM THAT POINT TO
IND-ATHE END OF THE BOOK.  MAY NOT CONTAIN DATA IN THE NARRATIVE
IND-AFIELD - MUST BE BLANK IN COLUMNS 06-72.
PARINSENUM DIFFERS FROM SEHED IN THAT SEHED SUPPRESSES BOTH SECTION
IND-ANUMBER AND SECTION NAME WHEREAS SENUM SUPPRESSES SECTION NUMBER
IND-AONLY.
INDEX* SEQ   - PUNCH RESEQUENCED DOCUMENTATION DECK
IND-ACAUSES THE PROGRAM TO PUNCH OUT A NEW DOCUMENTATION DECK WITH
IND-AREGENERATED SEQUENCE NUMBERS.  IF THE AUTHOR WISHES TO BEGIN NUM-
IND-ABERING AT SOME POINT OTHER THAN 00010 HE MAY SPECIFY THE BEGIN-
IND-ANING NUMBER IN COLUMNS 06 TO 10.  IF COLUMNS 06 TO 10 ARE BLANK,
IND-ANUMBERING WILL AUTOMATICALLY BEGIN AT 00010.  NUMBERS WILL BE
IND-AINCREMENTED BY 10 WHEREVER NUMBERING BEGINS.  SEQ CARD MAY NOT
IND-ACONTAIN NARRATIVE-MUST BE BLANK IN COLUMNS 11 TO 72.  MUST PRE-
IND-ACEDE THE FIRST CARD WHICH WOULD CAUSE A LINE TO BE PRINTED FOR
IND-AEACH BOOK.  IF OMITTED, A NEW DECK WILL NOT BE PUNCHED.
INDEX* SINGL - NORMAL SPACING TO BE SINGLE-SPACE
IND-ACAUSES THE NARRATIVE TO BE SINGLE SPACED UNLESS OVERRIDDEN BY
IND-AOTHER CONTROL WORDS SUCH AS PARA, PARIN, SPAC1 . . . SPAC9.  MAY
IND-ABE USED AT ANY POINT IN THE DATA REGARDLESS OF MODE.  SINGLE
IND-ASPACING WILL BEGIN WITH THE NEXT LINE AND CONTINUE UNTIL A DOUBL
IND-ACARD IS RECOGNIZED.  THE SINGL CARD MAY NOT CONTAIN NARRATIVE AND
IND-AMUST BE BLANK IN COLUMNS 06 TO 72.
PARINIF THE SINGL AND DOUBL CARDS ARE BOTH OMITTED SPACING WILL AUTO-
IND-AMATICALLY BEGIN WITH SINGLE SPACING FOR EACH BOOK.  NOTE ALSO
IND-ATHAT ANY MODE CHANGE CONTROL WORD (NARR, REPRT, OR TITLE) WILL
IND-AAUTOMATICALLY CHANGE NORMAL SPACING TO SINGLE.
INDEX* SKIP  - SKIP A PAGE
IND-ACAUSES THE PROGRAM TO EJECT TO THE NEXT PAGE, GENERATE THE BOOK
IND-AAND SECTION NAME LINES, IF ANY, AND REPLACE THE HEADING LINE (ON
IND-ATHIS PAGE ONLY) WITH THE DATA CONTAINED IN COLUMNS 06-50 OF THIS
IND-ACARD.  THE PAGE IS THEN EJECTED AND ALL HEADING LINES ARE PRINTED
IND-AON THE NEXT PAGE.  THE DATA IN COLUMNS 06-50 WILL ALSO BE ENTERED
IND-AIN THE TABLE OF CONTENTS.
PARINTHIS CONTROL WORD FACILITATES ENTERING HAND-DRAWN CHARTS INTO THE
          MANUAL WITHOUT DISTURBING THE PAGE NUMBERING SEQUENCE.

PARINIF PAGE OVERFLOW OCCURS DURING SPACING, NORMAL HEADINGS WILL
IND-ABE PRINTED ACCORDING TO THE SPECIFICATIONS INDICATED BY OTHER
IND-ACONTROL WORDS.  FOLLOWING SHEET EJECTION AND NORMAL PAGE HEAD-
IND-AINGS, ANY REMAINING SPACES WILL BE LEFT BEFORE READING THE
IND-ANEXT CARD.
PARA      SPACE CARDS MAY CONTAIN NARRATIVE DATA IN THE NARRATIVE
          FIELD.  IF SO, THE SPACING INDICATED WILL BE PERFORMED AND
          THE NARRATIVE DATA WILL BE PRINTED ON THE NEXT LINE.
PARINSPACE CARDS MAY BE USED AT ANY TIME REGARDLESS OF MODE.
INDEX* SUBPG - BEGIN SUB-PAGE NUMBERING
IND-ATHE SUBPG CONTROL WORD IS USED WHEN INSERTIONS ARE ADDED TO A
IND-ABOOK AND THE AUTHOR DOES NOT WISH TO REPRINT THE ENTIRE BOOK,
IND-ABUT ONLY THE PORTION(S) CHANGED.  IF, FOR EXAMPLE, THE AUTHOR
IND-AWISHES TO ADD THREE PAGES OF NEW DOCUMENTATION BETWEEN PAGES 45
IND-AAND 46, WITHOUT PRINTING ANY OF THE EXISTING PAGES, HE WOULD
IND-APRECEDE THE DATA BEING ADDED BY A SUBPG CARD CONTAINING THE FOL-
IND-ALOWING DATA '045.01' IN COLUMNS 06 TO 11.  THE SUBPG CARD WOULD
IND-ABE FOLLOWED BY THE DATA TO BE INSERTED AND BY AN ENSUB CARD.
IND-ATHIS WOULD CAUSE THE THREE PAGES TO BE NUMBERED 45.01, 45.02,
IND-AAND 45.03.  THE NEXT PAGE AFTER THE ENSUB CARD WOULD BE NUMBERED
IND-APAGE 46.  IF AT SOME LATER TIME, THE AUTHOR NEEDED TO ADD MORE
IND-APAGES FOLLOWING PAGE 45.03, HE COULD FOLLOW THE SAME PROCEDURE
IND-AUSING '045.04' IN THE SUBPG CARD.  IF THE AUTHOR WISHES TO ADD
IND-ADATA IN THE MIDDLE OF PAGE 45 WHICH WILL CAUSE AN OVERFLOW ONTO
IND-AONE OR MORE ADDITIONAL PAGES, HE MUST REPRINT ALL OF THE DATA
IND-AFOR PAGE 45 PRECEDED BY THE SUBPG CARD.
PARINTHE SUBPG CARD MAY ALSO BE USED WITHOUT SPECIFYING THE PAGE NUM-
IND-ABER UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.  IF, FOR EXAMPLE, MANY CHANGES
IND-AWERE BEING MADE TO A SINGLE SECTION OF A BOOK AND THE AUTHOR
IND-AWANTED TO REPRINT THE ENTIRE SECTION WITHOUT DISTURBING PAGE NUM-
IND-ABERS OF PRECEDING AND FOLLOWING SECTIONS, THE SUBPG CONTROL WORD
IND-ACOULD BE USED.  ONE PROCEDURE FOR THIS TYPE OF SITUATION WOULD BE
IND-ATO SELECT ALL OF THE DATA CARDS FOR THE DESIRED SECTION, PRECED-
IND-AING THEM WITH A 'PAGE' CONTROL CARD TO INDICATE THE FIRST PAGE OF
IND-ATHE SECTION.  AT THE POINT(S) WHERE ADDITIONAL DATA IS BEING IN-
IND-ASERTED, THE AUTHOR WOULD PRECEDE EACH GROUP OF INSERTIONS WITH A
IND-ASUBPG CARD CONTAINING NO STARTING NUMBER AND FOLLOWING EACH GROUP
IND-AWITH AN ENSUB CARD.  THIS WOULD CAUSE THE SYSTEM TO START SUB-
IND-APAGE NUMBERING ON THE NEXT PAGE PRINTED USING WHATEVER PAGE NUM-
IND-ABER HAD ACCUMULATED AND CONTINUING THE SUB-PAGING UNTIL THE ENSUB
IND-ACARD WAS ENCOUNTERED.  BY SO DOING, THE FIRST PAGE OF THE NEXT
IND-ASECTION (WHICH WAS NOT PRINTED) WILL STILL HAVE THE SAME PAGE
IND-ANUMBER SINCE ALL INSERTIONS WERE ENTERED UNDER SUB-PAGING.
PARINONCE SUB-PAGING HAS BEEN STARTED BY USING THE SUBPG CONTROL WORD
IND-AIT WILL CONTINUE TO END OF BOOK OR UNTIL AN ENSUB, PAGE, OR SUBPG
IND-ACONTROL WORD IS ENCOUNTERED.  CONTROL WORDS BOOK, ENSUB, AND PAGE
IND-AWILL ALL CAUSE SUB-PAGE NUMBERING TO END BEFORE THE NEXT PAGE IS
IND-APRINTED, BUT WITH SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT RESULTS.  ANOTHER SUBPG CARD
IND-AENDS SUB-PAGING WITH THE PAGE NUMBERS BEING USED AND CAUSES SUB-
IND-APAGING TO RESUME WITH THE NUMBERS SPECIFIED IN THE NEW SUBPG
IND-ACARD.
PARINIF SUB-PAGING IS ENDED BY A BOOK CARD, THE NEXT BOOK WILL BEGIN,
IND-AAS USUAL, AT PAGE ONE UNLESS THE BOOK CARD IS FOLLOWED BY A PAGE
IND-AOR SUBPG CARD.
PARINIF SUB-PAGING IS ENDED BY AN ENSUB CARD, THE NEXT PAGE PRINTED
IND-AWILL CONTAIN THE NEXT SEQUENTIAL PAGE NUMBER.  IF, FOR EXAMPLE,
IND-AENSUB WAS ENCOUNTERED DURING THE PRINTING OF PAGE 213.07 THE
IND-ANEXT PAGE WOULD BE NUMBERED 214.
PARINIF SUB-PAGING IS ENDED BY A PAGE CARD, THE NEXT PAGE PRINTED
IND-AWOULD CONTAIN THE PAGE NUMBER SPECIFIED IN THE PAGE CARD.
PARINTHE SUBPG CARD MAY BE USED AS DESIRED REGARDLESS OF MODE.  IF
IND-AOMITTED, NORMAL PAGE NUMBERING WILL OCCUR.

IND-BCC. 73-80 SEQUENCE NUMBER (OPTIONAL)
INDEX* TITLE - CHANGE TO TITLE MODE
IND-ACAUSES PROGRAM TO CHANGE TO TITLE MODE.  MAY BE ENTERED AT ANY
IND-APOINT IN THE DATA REGARDLESS OF PRESENT MODE.  CAUSES AN AUTO-
IND-AMATIC CHANGE TO SINGLE SPACING.  IF A PAPER CHANGE IS REQUIRED
IND-AOR IF THE AUTHOR WISHES TO CONVEY SOME MESSAGE TO THE COMPUTER
IND-AOPERATOR, THE DESIRED MESSAGE MAY BE PLACED IN COLUMNS 06 TO 72
IND-AOF THE 'TITLE' CARD.  THIS WILL CAUSE A THREE LINE MESSAGE TO
IND-AAPPEAR ON THE CONSOLE.  THE FIRST LINE READS 'NOW CHANGING TO
IND-ATITLE MODE.'  THE SECOND LINE WILL CONTAIN THE MESSAGE FROM COL-
IND-AUMNS 06 TO 72 OF THE 'TITLE' CARD.  THE THIRD LINE READS 'EOB TO
IND-ACONTINUE.'
PARINIF THE 'TITLE' CARD IS BLANK IN COLUMNS 06 TO 72, THE MODE CHANGE
IND-AAND SPACING CHANGE WILL OCCUR BUT NO MESSAGE WILL BE PRINTED AND
IND-ATHE MACHINE WILL NOT STOP.
PARINIF MULTIPLE COPIES HAVE BEEN SPECIFIED, A MESSAGE STOP FOR ANY
IND-AOF THE MODE CHANGES WILL OCCUR ONLY ON THE FIRST COPY.
PARINTHE TITLE CARD WILL NOT CAUSE IMMEDIATE SHEET EJECTION.  WHEN
IND-ATHE NEXT PAGE IS PRINTED, HOWEVER, PAGE HEADINGS WILL NOT BE
IND-APRINTED.  NOTE THAT PAGE NUMBERS (OR SUB-PAGE NUMBERS) WILL CON-
IND-ATINUE TO BE INCREMENTED FOR EACH PAGE PRINTED EVEN THOUGH THE
IND-AHEADINGS ARE NOT BEING PRINTED.  FOR MORE INFORMATION REGARDING
IND-ATHE EFFECTS OF TITLE MODE, SEE TABLE OF CONTENTS 'DOCUMENTATION

PARA      IN DOCUMENTS HAVING MANY SUB-TITLES, CREATED BY 'INDEX'
          CONTROL WORDS, THE AUTHOR MAY WISH TO AVOID THE POSSIBILITY
          OF HAVING A SUB-TITLE APPEAR AS THE LAST LINE ON A PAGE WITH
          THE DESCRIPTIVE NARRATIVE ON THE FOLLOWING PAGE.  IF SO, THE
          AUTHOR MAY SPECIFY IN AN 'XLINE' CARD THAT PAGE OVERFLOW IS
          TO BE FORCED WHEN AN INDEX CARD IS ENCOUNTERED AFTER A
          CERTAIN NUMBER OF LINES HAVE BEEN PRINTED ON A PAGE.  SINCE
          PAGE OVERFLOW IS NORMALLY CONTROL- LED BY THE 'LINES'
          CONTROL WORD, THE 'XLINE' CONTROL MUST CONTAIN A LESSER
          NUMBER OF LINES IN ORDER TO BE EFFECTIVE.
PARA      CONTROL WORDS EJECT, HEAD, AND SECT WILL CAUSE SHEET
          EJECTION WHEN ENCOUNTERED WITHOUT AFFECTING OR BEING
          AFFECTED BY AN XLINE CONTROL WORD.  ASIDE FROM THE
          POSSIBILITY OF CAUSING SHEET EJECT, THE USE OF 'XLINE' DOES
          NOT AFFECT THE NORMAL PROCESSING OF INDEX CONTROL WORDS.
          THE 'XLINE' CONTROL WORD IS VALID IN ANY MODE AND MAY BE
          INSERTED AT ANY POINT IN THE BOOK.

HEAD CONTROL WORD SEQUENCE
PARININ ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED RESULTS IN THE PRINTING OF DOCU-
     MENTATION, THE SEQUENCE OF CONTROL WORDS MUST BE RESTRICTED
     SOMEWHAT.  THE FIRST CARD OF EACH BOOK MUST BE A BOOK CARD.
     SINCE EACH BOOK IS TREATED AS A SEPARATE ENTITY, THE BOOK CARD IS
     NECESSARY TO SIGNAL THE THE BEGINNING OF A NEW ENTITY, CONCLUDE
     THE PROCESSING OF THE PREVIOUS BOOK, AND INITIALIZE THE SYSTEM IN
     PREPARATION FOR THE NEW BOOK.
PARINTHE FOLLOWING CONTROL WORDS ESTABLISH PROCESSING REQUIREMENTS FOR
     THE ENTIRE BOOK IN WHICH THEY APPEAR.  FOR THIS REASON, THEY MUST
     BE USED AFTER THE BOOK CARD BUT BEFORE THE FIRST CARD WHICH WOULD
     CAUSE A LINE TO BE PRINTED.
PARINCOPY  (MAY BE OMITTED IF ONE COPY IS DESIRED)
IND-ADATE
IND-ANOHED (MAY BE OMITTED IF NORMAL HEADINGS ARE DESIRED)
IND-ANOTAB (MAY BE OMITTED IF TABLE OF CONTENTS IS DESIRED
IND-ASEQ   (MAY BE OMITTED IF RESEQUENCED DECK IS NOT DESIRED
PARINIF ANY OF THE ABOVE LISTED CONTROL WORDS ARE ENCOUNTERED AFTER
     THE FIRST LINE OF THE BOOK HAS BEEN PRINTED, THE SYSTEM IS UNABLE
     TO PROCESS THEM CORRECTLY.  THEY ARE, THEREFORE, BYPASSED AND AN
     APPROP- RIATE ERROR MESSAGE IS RECORDED ON THE DIAGNOSTICS LIST.
PARINALL OTHER CONTROL WORDS HAVE AN EFFECT ON A LIMITED PORTION OF
     THE BOOK BEING PRINTED.  SO LONG AS THE DESIRED CONTROL WORD IS
     VALID FOR THE MODE IN WHICH ENCOUNTERED, IT MAY BE USED AT ANY
     TIME.  FOR DETAILS REGARDING THE USE OF CONTROL WORDS IN THE
     VARIOUS MODES, REFER TO 'DOCUMENTATION PRINTING MODES'.
SECT DEFAULT OR STANDARD OPTIONS
          IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE THE NUMBER OF CONTROL WORDS REQUIRED TO
     PRODUCE DOCUMENTATION, THE SYSTEM HAS A SERIES OF BUILT-IN OPTIONS
     WHICH ARE ASSUMED UNLESS THE AUTHOR SPECIFIES OTHERWISE.  IF, AS
     IS OFTEN THE CASE, THE AUTHOR WISHES TO USE ONE OF THE STANDARD
     OPTIONS, NO CONTROL WORD IS NECESSARY.  IT IS ONLY IN CASES WHERE
     THE AUTHOR WISHES TO CHANGE THE STANDARD OPTIONS THAT CONTROL WORDS
     ARE REQUIRED.
PARINFOR MAXIMUM FLEXIBILITY EACH BOOK IS TREATED AS A SEPARATE
     ENTITY.  SINCE THE OPTIONS SPECIFIED FOR A GIVEN BOOK DO NOT
     NECES- SARILY APPLY TO SUBSEQUENT BOOKS, ALL OPTIONS ARE RESET
     AUTOMATICALLY TO THE STANDARD OPTIONS AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH
     BOOK.  THE DEFAULT OR STANDARD OPTIONS ASSUMED FOR EACH BOOK ARE
     DESCRIBED BELOW.
PARINMODE OF OPERATION = NARR
               THE SYSTEM BEGINS EACH BOOK IN NARRATIVE MODE UNLESS A
               'REPRT' OR 'TITLE' OR 'LIST' CONTROL WORD IS ENTERED.
PARINNUMBER OF COPIES = COPY 01
               IN THE ABSENCE OF A 'COPY' CARD, ONE COPY IS PRINTED.
PARINNORMAL SPACING = SINGL
               AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH BOOK AND AT EACH CHANGE IN
               MODE, THE NORMAL SPACING IS SET TO 'SINGL'.  SINGLE
               SPACING IS USED UNTIL A 'DOUBL' CONTROL WORD IS
               ENCOUNTERED.  OTHER SPACE CONTROL WORDS SUCH AS 'PARA',
               'PARIN', AND 'SPAC1' CAUSE EXTRA SPACES BUT THESE DO
               NOT CHANGE THE NORMAL SPACING WHICH IS ESTABLISHED BY
               THE 'SINGL' OR 'DOUBL' CONTROL WORDS.
PARINPAGE NUMBERING = PAGE 001
               NORMALLY, PAGE NUMBERING BEGINS ON PAGE ONE FOR EACH
               BOOK AND CONTINUES CONSECUTIVELY REGARDLESS OF THE
               OPERATING MODE.  IF THE AUTHOR WISHES TO DEVIATE FROM
               THIS PROCEDURE, HE MAY ENTER PAGE NUMBERING CONTROL
               WORDS AT ANY POINT IN THE INPUT.  CONTROL WORDS
               AFFECTING PAGE NUMBERS (PAGE, SUBPG, AND ENSUB) ARE
               DISCUSSED IN THE SECTION ON CONTROL WORDS.
PARINLINES PER PAGE = LINES 56
               FIFTY-SIX LINES (INCLUDING HEADINGS AND SPACES) ARE
               PRINTED AUTOMATICALLY ON EACH PAGE UNLESS THE AUTHOR
               SPECIFIES OTHERWISE BY ENTERING A 'LINES' CONTROL WORD.
PARINRESEQUENCED INPUT DECK
IND-BIF THE AUTHOR NEEDS TO HAVE THE INPUT DATA RESEQUENCED
               AND REPUNCHED, HE SPECIFIES THE CONTROL WORD 'SEQ'.  IF
               NO NEW DECK IS DESIRED, THE 'SEQ' CARD IS OMITTED.
EJECT
PARINPRINTING OF PAGE/LINE NUMBERS (INPUT CARD SEQUENCE)
               WHEN IT IS NECESSARY TO PRINT THE SEQUENCE NUMBERS FROM
               THE INPUT RECORDS, THE 'PRTPG' CONTROL WORD IS ENTERED.
               IF 'PRTPG' IS OMITTED, INPUT SEQUENCE NUMBERS ARE NOT
               PRINTED.
