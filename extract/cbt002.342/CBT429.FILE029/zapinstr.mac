             ZAPPING A VTOC ENTRY WITH UCLA FULL SCREEN ZAP
             ----------------------------------------------

 PLEASE SEE THE BOTTOM OF THIS MEMBER FIRST.

 I AM REFERRING TO THE ZAP PROGRAM AVAILABLE ON FILE 300 OF THE CBT
    MVS MODS TAPE.  THIS IS JIM MARSHALL'S LIBRARY OF TSO COMMANDS.

 I ASSUME YOU HAVE THE ZAP PROGRAM PROPERLY INSTALLED.  IT IS A TSO
    COMMAND, AND IT MUST BE EXECUTED AUTHORIZED IN ORDER TO ZAP A VTOC
    ENTRY.  IF YOU CAN'T DO THIS, PLEASE CONSULT YOUR LOCAL TSO GURU
    UNTIL YOU'VE GOTTEN IT RIGHT.  (FOR MOST USES, ZAP DOESN'T HAVE
    TO BE AUTHORIZED).

 TO GET TO THE VTOC ON A GIVEN PACK DO THE FOLLOWING: (I AM ASSUMING
    THAT THE PACK NAME IS PACK01, AND THERE IS A CATALOGED DATASET
    ON PACK01 CALLED SYS2.DATASET).

      A.  INVOKE THE ZAP PROGRAM AUTHORIZED:
                   ( ENTER THE COMMAND:  ZAP  )
                   (  IN MY SHOP, THERE'S A "MAGIC" SVC, SO I
                        ENTER EITHER "OP Z" OR "$$ ZAP" )

      B.  THE SYSTEM COMES BACK WITH:  "ENTER DATASET NAME"
                 ENTER:   'FORMAT4.DSCB' ALLOCD('SYS2.DATASET')

                     IF 'SYS2.DATASET' IS CATALOGED TO PACK01,
                     YOU'LL GET THE FORMAT4 DSCB OF PACK01.
                     ALL THE OTHER DSCB'S COME AFTERWARDS.

           *  NOTE.  IF YOU'RE ZAPPING ANOTHER DATASET, JUST ENTER
                       ITS TSO-QUALIFIED NAME.

      C.  THE SYSTEM WILL NOW DISPLAY THE FORMAT4 (HEADER) DSCB.
              THE ZAP PROGRAM HAS A BUILT-IN TUTORIAL THAT CAN
              BE ENTERED BY PUTTING "?" ON THE COMMAND LINE.
              TO GET OUT OF THE TUTORIAL, PUT "U" ON THE COMMAND
              LINE.  CHANGES ARE MADE PERMANENT WITH THE COMMAND
              "ZAP".

      D.  ADVICE:  LEARN THE TUTORIAL FIRST.  YOU CAN ALWAYS GET
              INTO IT BY ENTERING "?" ON THE CMD LINE, AND BACK TO
              WHERE YOU WERE BY ENTERING "U" ON THE COMMAND LINE.
              THE TUTORIAL HAS 13 SCREENS.  AT LEAST GLANCE AT THEM ALL.
              YOU DON'T PUT SPACES BETWEEN THE COMMAND AND THE OPERAND.
              THE COMMAND "END" QUITS YOU OUT OF ZAP AT ANY TIME.
              THE COMMAND "P" GETS YOU TO THE BEGINNING OF THE FORMAT4.
              THERE IS A LITTLE ARROW "<" OR ">" THAT POINTS TO
              THE CURRENT BYTE.  GO FORWARD AND BACKWARD BY ENTERING
              PLUS OR MINUS THE NUMBER OF BYTES IN HEX.  FOR EXAMPLE:
              +3 (3 BYTES FORWARD), -C (X'C' BYTES BACKWARD), ETC.
              TO SUBSTITUE UP TO 8 BYTES STARTING FROM THE CURRENT
              BYTE, ENTER "S" FOLLOWED BY A HEX VALUE--NO SPACES IN
              BETWEEN.  TO MAKE CHANGES PERMANENT, ENTER "ZAP".
              ALWAYS GET A ZAP LOG IF YOU'VE CHANGED SOMETHING, UNTIL
              YOU'RE COMPLETELY FAMILIAR WITH THE PROGRAM.

  ******      IT IS ADVISABLE TO ZAP SOME LESS-MEANINGFUL DATASETS
  ******      BEFORE TACKLING A VTOC.
