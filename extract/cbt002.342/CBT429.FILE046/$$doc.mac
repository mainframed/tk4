                    NEW DOC FOR PACKRAT PROGRAM

INSTRUCTIONS:

     The PACKRAT program from Mass Mutual has the one function of
scratching (and uncataloging) datasets quickly.  Operating as a TSO
command, it does its own 3270 screen I/O and displays a screen full
of VTOC entries for the disk pack that you point it to.

     An initial screen gives you an opportunity to point to a disk
pack volser, and to supply the program with a Julian date.  Any
datasets created on the supplied Julian date (TODAY's DATE is
default) will be highlighted.  After the initial information is
typed in, press enter, and the first screen of VTOC entries will be
displayed.  If you want to scratch a dataset, all you have to do is
type "XX" next to its screen entry and press enter.  You can do any
of the entries that are on the whole screen.

     If any action was requested (any XX'es were typed) the current
screen is re-displayed to show which datasets were deleted, and
you have another chance to delete more datasets from that screen.
If no further XX'es were typed, the next screen-full of VTOC entries
is displayed.  If you wanted to delete a dataset that is currently
being enqueued on or is being used, the words "not deleted" are shown.

     When the entire VTOC has been displayed (it is in TTR order),
the initial screen is shown again, and you have the opportunity to
enter another pack volser.  Type a character in the "action" field
to get out of the program cleanly.  Otherwise you can "attention" out.

CHANGES:

     Bruce Leland of Hitachi America in San Jose, CA, has updated
the BACKEND module of PACKRAT so it will work on an MVS/XA or an
MVS/370 system.  His changes to the BACKEND source have to do with
running a different UCB scan routine, if you're running on an XA
system.  (Difference deck is called DIFXAMOD. You don't need it.
It's just included for reference. SG)

     Sam Golob has customized PACKRAT in 2 ways, affecting both the
BACKEND and the PACKRAT modules.  IEBUPDTE difference decks are
provided to create the modifications as indicated:

 Sam has 2 load modules:  PACKRAT  (using PACKRATN and BACKENDN source)
                    and:  PACKRATX (using PACKRATX and BACKENDX source)

     A.  In PACKRAT, the company titles were changed to NEWSWEEK.
               (difference deck  DIFPNWK creates PACKRATN source.)
               (difference deck  DIFPNWKX creates PACKRATX source.)
               (the reason for the difference for PACKRATX is
                      that a slightly different screen appearance
                      is produced.  PACKRATX is the more "dangerous"
                      form of the program, and the different screen
                      shows me that I'm using THAT version.)

     B.  In BACKEND, Newsweek has 2 different versions:
            a.  Program BACKENDN cannot delete SYS1. datasets only.
            b.  Program BACKENDX can delete SYS1. datasets also.
               (difference deck  DIFBNWK creates BACKENDN source.)
               (difference deck  DIFBNWKX creates BACKENDX source.)
