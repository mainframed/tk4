Notes on the LAMDA program.

    The purpose of the LAMDA program is to load LPA-resident modules
into CSA, and the code shows you how to do it.

    This program is coded with structured macros, which are included
in the package.

    The value of this package is the following:

1-  You see how to load programs into CSA.
2-  You get all of these beautiful structured macros and you can
     learn how to code with them.
3-  Anything else you can gain.
