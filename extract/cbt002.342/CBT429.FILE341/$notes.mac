LAMDA LOADS THE ISAM SUPPORT MODULES INTO THE CSA.  LAMDA USES 24-BIT
ADDRESSING AND RESIDES BELOW THE LINE (OBVIOUSLY).

I USE A SET OF MACROS TO BUILD A STRUCTURED TYPE OF PROGRAMMING.
LAMDA WILL ASSEMBLE USING THE MACROS IN THIS PDS.

I BELIEVE THE DOCUMENTATION IN THE PROGRAM IS SUFFICIENT TO FOLLOW THE
FLOW.  IF NOT, I CAN BE REACHED AT (425) 254-4191.  OR, AT
MYUHAS@PACCAR.COM
