                                                              REV 1/19/8

  DLXTRANS IS A GENERALIZED FILE TRANSFER PROGRAM.  IT WILL REFORMAT
       ANY SEQUENTIAL FILE INTO 80-BYTE RECORDS FOR TRANSMISSION AND
       RECREATE THE ORIGINAL FILE AFTER TRANSMISSION.
0 DLXTRANS WILL PROCESS ANY RECORD FORMAT, INCLUDING VARIABLE LENGTH
       AND SPANNED RECORDS, EXCEPT FOR RECFM=U.
0      VSAM DATASETS CAN BE TRANSMITTED BY USING IDCAMS REPRO OR EXPORT
       TO CREATE A SEQUENTIAL FILE FOR SENDING AND TO RECREATE THE VSAM
       FILE AFTER TRANSMISSION.
0      PARTITIONED DATASETS CAN BE TRANSMITTED SUCCESSFULLY BY USING
       IEBCOPY TO CREATE A SEQUENTIAL FILE CONSISTING OF ANY OR ALL
       MEMBERS OF THE PDS, AND AGAIN TO RECREATE THE PDS AFTER
       TRANSMISSION.
0   ** NOTE:  THIS INCLUDES PARTITIONED DATASETS WITH RECFM=U, SUCH AS
               LOAD LIBRARIES.
