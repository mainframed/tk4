                                                              REV 9/17/8
-
  DLXREBLK IS A GENERALIZED FILE REBLOCKING PROGRAM.  IT WILL REWRITE
       ANY SEQUENTIAL FILE INTO A FILE WITH A RECORD LENGTH LARGER OR
       SMALLER THAN THE ORIGINAL, PROVIDING THAT ONE RECORD LENGTH IS
       AN INTEGRAL MULTIPLE OF THE OTHER.
0 DLXREBLK WILL NOT PROCESS VARIABLE LENGTH RECORDS.
0 WHEN BLOCKING UP TO LARGER RECORDS, THERE MUST BE ENOUGH INPUT RECORDS
       TO CREATE WHOLE OUTPUT RECORDS.  IF THERE ARE ANY INPUT RECORDS
       LEFT OVER, AN ERROR (DLX007E) WILL RESULT AND THE OUTPUT FILE
       WILL BE EMPTY.
