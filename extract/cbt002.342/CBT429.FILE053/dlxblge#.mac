1                             DLXBLGEN
               GENERALIZED DATASET REBLOCKING PROGRAM
- DLXBLGEN is a program used to reblock files from or to 80-byte records
0 DLXBLGEN will process any fixed block sequential file.
     NOTE:  A single member of a partitioned dataset can be processed,
            since it is treated as a sequential dataset.
- OPERATION OF DLXBLGEN
0 DLXBLGEN determines the lrecl's of the SYSUT1 and SYSUT2 files. One
  of the files must have an lrecl of 80-bytes.  If not, the program
  will terminate with a return code of 8.
0 If the lrecl of SYSUT1 is less than the lrecl of SYSUT2, the program
  will combine as many SYSUT1 records as necessary to create a SYSUT2
  record of the specified lrecl.
0 If the lrecl of SYSUT1 is greater than the lrecl of SYSUT2, the
  program will write as many SYSUT2 records as necessary for each
  SYSUT1 record.
0 DLXBLGEN also generates a SYSPRINT file.  It gives record counts for
  the number of SYSUT1 records read and the number of SYSUT2 records
  written.
1 NOTES ON USE OF DLXBLGEN:
-
    SAMPLE JCL: (reblock a 128-byte dataset to an 80-byte dataset)
0   //DLXBLGEN  JOB (GEB1,9999),'NAME',CLASS=A,MSGCLASS=A,MSGLEVEL=(1,1)

-
    SAMPLE JCL: (reblock back to a 128-byte dataset)
0   //DLXBLGEN  JOB (GEB1,9999),'NAME',CLASS=A,MSGCLASS=A,MSGLEVEL=(1,1)

 ERROR MESSAGES:
0   ***** EITHER SYSUT1 OR SYSUT2 MUST HAVE AN LRECL OF 80 BYTES *****
    The program requires that one of the datasets be 80-byte records.
0   ***** # OF INPUT RECORDS NOT A MULTIPLE OF OUTPUT RECORDS -
     LAST RECORD(S) IGNORED *****
    The program expects that when combining SYSUT1 record to make a
      larger SYSUT2 record, the number of SYSUT1 records should be a
      multiple of the number of SYSUT2 records.
