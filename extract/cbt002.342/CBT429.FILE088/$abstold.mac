MY NEW SYSTEM IS AT OS/390 LEVEL 2.4.0 WITH JES2
WE NOW HAVE 2 9672'S AND WE WILL BE INSTALLING THE NEXT OS/390 BETA
VERY SOON.  I WILL INCREASE MY EFFORT TO ADD PRODUCTS HERE AND
AS THEY ARE TESTED ON 390 I WILL UPDATE THE PROGRAMS TO REFLECT THAT.

SOME OF THE MODS AND PROGRAMS ARE AT MVS/SP 1.3.4 LEVEL, THE ONES
THAT HAVE BEEN UPGRADED TO XA 2.2.0 ARE REVFLECTED IN THE TEXT.
PLEASE NOTE THAT SOME OF THE MVS/SP MODULES AND MODS WILL WORK
ALSO ON MVS/XA. MANY ARE ALREADY OS/390 COMPATABLE, (EVEN IF THEY
DON'T SAY IT YET)

THE FOLLOWING ARE MODIFICATIONS AND PROGRAMS WRITTEN HERE AT SYZYGY
OR BRIPER, OR PRC CORP. BEFORE I LEFT THERE TO COME HERE,
EITHER BY MYSELF OR STOLEN FROM A FRIEND AND MODIFIED TO WORK HERE.
SYSMODS START WITH FORMAT PRCM FOR MVS MODS AND PRCJ FOR JES2 MODS
OUR CURRENT SYSTEM IS MVS/SP 1.3.3 AT 8603 AND JES2/SP 1.3.4 AT
   (THATS THE OLD SYSTEM)
8601. ALL OF THE STUFF ON THIS FILE WORKS VERY WELL AND IF THERE ARE
ANY QUESTIONS AT ALL, PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CALL ME AT.
      BRIAN WESTERMAN
      SEE ADDRESS ABOVE     .

I HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF PROGRAMS AND MODS AND WILL SEND THEM
PERIODICALLY AS I CLEAN UP SOME OF MY CODE.  I AM NOT VERY WELL
KNOWN FOR DOCUMENTATION AND I AM ATTEMPTING TO PUT AS MUCH IN THE
CODE AS I CAN BEFORE I SUBMIT IT.

CATLIST - EXEC TO READ CATALOG AND CREATE A COMPLETE IDCAMS EXPORT
          JCL TO BACKUP ALL CATALOGS IN THE SYSTEM.  ANY TIME
          YOU CREATE A NEW CATALOG, (OR DELETE ONE) ALL YOU NEED TO
          DO IS RUN THE SYSBLD00 JOB WHICH EXECUTES THIS EXEC AND
          WILL BUILD A SYSCATBK JOBSTREAM. (ONE IS INCLUDED HERE
          AS WELL)
EX8     - OS/390 COMPATABLE EXIT 8 FOR SENDING JOB END MAX COND CODE.
          (SEE EXIT08 STUFF BELOW)
EX16    - OS/390 COMPATABLE EXIT 16 FOR SENDING JOB END MAX COND CODE.
          (SEE EXIT16 STUFF BELOW)
EXIT004 - JCL SCAN EXIT (4) TO MAKE /** CARD A COMMENT (WE HAVE SOME
          PRETTY DUMB USERS, AND TO MAKE THE /*NOSETUP CARD A COMMENT
          SINCE WE USED TO REQUIRE EITHER A SETUP OR A NOSETUP
          IN THE PAST WE HAD TO AT LEAST IGNORE IT UNTIL OUR
          USERS CHANGED ALL OF THERE JCL (IT'S BEEN OVER A YEAR NOW
          AND THEY STILL SAY THAT THEY ARE WORKING ON IT!!!)
EXIT010 - NOTIFY EXIT (10) TO SEND THE JOB ENDED NOTIFY MESSAGE TO
          WYLBUR USERS WHO SUBMIT JOBS,  IT LOOKS FOR A NOTIFY
          MESSAGE FOR A WYLBUR USER AND REFORMATS IT INTO A
          F WYLBUR,TO XXXXXX AND THEN THE MESSAGE TEXT.
EXITP20 - END OF JOB INPUT EXIT (20) WHICH WILL CAUSE A JOB TO BE ROUTED
          TO ANOTHER CPU IN A MULT ACCESS SPOOL COMPLEX AUTOMATICALLY
          WITHOUT MAKING THE USER TYPE IN THE /*ROUTE STUFF
EXIT020 - END OF JOB INPUT EXIT (20) WHICH CHECKS THE JCT OF THE JOB
          ALSO THE JCL TO SE IF THE GUY ASKED FOR A SPECIAL PRIORITY
          AND IF SO HE WILL ISSUE A MESSAGE TO THE OPERATOR WHICH
          WILL BE HIGHLIGHTED AND NOT ROLL OFF THE SCREEN WHICH
          TELLS HIM THAT A SPECIAL PRIORITY JOB WAS SUBMITTED
EX05... - 3   JES2 COMMAND EXITS (5) WHICH WILL DO VARIOUS THINGS
          LIKE NOT ALLOW THE OPERATOR TO PURGE THE ENTIRE QUEUE
          AND WILL DISPLAY JOB SETUPS WITH A COMMAND.
EX005UD - JES2 EXIT(5) WHICH WILL GIVE YOU THE $UNDUMP COMMAND
          THIS ALLOWS YOU TO UNDO EVERTHING THAT YOU HAVE DONE WITH
          THE $DUMP COMMAND, SO THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO DUMP AND RELOAD
          EVERTHING JUST BECAUSE YOU FORGOT A PARAMETER ON YOUR
          $DUMP COMMAND.
JX05    - JES 2.2.0 VERSION OF THE ABOVE EX05... STUFF
J005$DV - JES 2.2.0 $DV COMMAND TO DISPLAY DASD VOLUMES FROM JES2
J005LOAD- JES 2.2.0 $LOAD COMMAND TO LOAD NEW COPIES OF EXITS
EXIT008 - JCT WRITE EXIT FOR JES2 EXIT(8) WHICH WILL PUT THE CONDITION
          CODE OF THE JOB STEP INTO THE JCT IF IT IS GREATER THAN
          WHAT IS ALREADY THERE.  THIS EXIT WORKS IN CONJUNCTION
          WITH EXIT016 AND EXIT008 MUST BE IN LPALIB.  IT IS VERY
          SMALL SO THERE IS LITTLE WORRY ABOUT PUTTING IT THERE.
JX08    - MVS/XA 2.2.0 VERSION OF EXIT008 ABOVE
EXIT016 - THIS JES EXIT(16) GETS INVOKED AT JOB TERMINATION AND WILL
          TAKE THE DATA PLACED IN THE JCT BY EXIT8 AND FORMAT A NOTIFY
          MESSAGE FOR TSO USERS AS TO THE MAX CONDITION CODE OF THE
          STEP AS WELL AS WHETHER IT ABENDED OR NOT WITH EITHER A
          SYSTEM OR USER ABEND. THE USERS ARE VERY PLEASED.
JX16    - JES 2.2.0 VERSION OF THE ABOVE EXIT016
EXIT212 - THIS JES EXIT(212) IS A DUMPER/LOADER EXIT WHICH ALLOWS YOU
          TO DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATE THE DUMPER/LOADER TAPE DSN INSTEAD
          OF ALWAYS HAVEING TO HAVE A PRE-ALLOCATED TAPE DSN.  THIS HAS
          SOLVED ALOT OF HEADACHES FOR THE OPERATIONS STAFF ... AND ME.
          THIS REQUIRES THE PRCJ2212 USERMOD TO JES.  ALL THE MOD
          DOES IS ADD THE $EXIT POINT INTO HASPSTAM.
EX99 ---- PROGRAM USED BY PRCM0005 SYSMOD
FINDASCB- PROGRAM INDEXES THROUGH ASVT AND WILL LOCATE A JOB OR
          ADDRESS SPACE WHO'S NAME MATCHES WHAT YOU PUT IN REG1
GETINFO - PROGRAM ORIGINALLY FROM NTL BUT HAS SOME MINOR CHANGES AND
          ALSO HAS BEEN CHANGED TO RUN ON A MVS/SP SYSTEM INSTEAD
          OF OR I SHOULD SAY AS WELL AS MVS/XA
IEFACTRT  THIS IS PRETTY STANDARD STUFF EXCEP THAT IT UPDATES THE
          JOBS OUTPUT RESOLUTION MESSAGE AREA WITH WHAT WE LIKE
          TO CALL "BOX SCORES".  THIS IS SIMALAR TO WHAT IBM'S
          FREEBEE DOES BUT PUTS IT IN A BETTER PLACE.  YOU MAY
          WANT TO CHANGE SOME CODE SINCE WE ALSO DO A COUPLE OF
          CALCULATIONS TO TELL THE USER APPROXIMATELY WHAT THE JOB
          COST TO RUN.  THE CHARGE CODE IS VERY SIMPLE SO NO ONE
          SHOULD HAVE ANY PROBLEMS.
JES215MD- TWO MODS TO JES 2.1.5 THE FIRST IS TO HASPSSSM TO PUT
          THE DATE ON THE INITIATOR STARTED MESSAGE $HASP373
          THE SECOND MOD IS TO HASPCOMM IT ALLOWS THE $D'JOBNAME
          COMMAND TO ACT AS A GENERIC JOBNAME DISPLAY
          IE. IF YOU ENTERED $D'IMS   , YOU WOULD GET
          A LIST OF ALL JOBS IN ALL QUEUES WHO'S PREFIX MATCHED
          THE LETTERS "IMS".  OPERATORS LIKE IT A LOT.
MCS  ---- A VERY UNIQUE SPY COMMAND FROM ONE OF THE PRC SUBSIDIARIES
          I'M NOT SURE WHICH ONE, BUT I LIKE THE CODE
MINIGEN - THE GOOD OLD MINIGEN, WE HAVE USED IT FOR YEARS AND
          CONTRARY TO POPULAR BELIEF IT CAN BE USED EVEN IF YOU
          ARE ADDING A NEW DEVICE TYPE.  THE BEST WAY TO USE THIS
          GUY IS TO BROWSE YOUR STAGE1 OUTPUT AND FIND ALL
          OCCURRENCES OF " EXEC  ASMS"  THE MOD=XXXXXXX PARAMETER
          ON EACH ONE OF THESE GUYS SHOULD BE PUT IN THE ASSEM (
          SECTION OF THE MINIGEN.  THIS IS A HELL OF A LOT SAFER
          THAN A IOGEN AND THISA WAY WE NEVER LOOSE ANY USERMODS
PANBKPRT- THIS GUY WILL TAKE A PANVALET BACKUP TAPE AND CREATE A
          LISTING OF WHAT PROGRAMS AND VERSIONS AND SIZE AND ALL
          IS ON THE TAPE. JUST AS IF IT WERE STILL ON DISK.
          THIS WAY YOU DONT HAVE TO RESTORE THE WHOLE TAPE DOWN
          JUST TO FIND SOMTHING THAT YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW THE NAME
          OF OR EVEN GUESS AT.
POSTER -- DOES WHAT IT SAYS, CREATES POSTERS-BANNERS.
PRCJ2001- JES2/SP 1.3.4 MOD TO ALLOW GENERIC $D'XXX' FOR PARTIAL
          JOBNAMES.
PRCJ2004- JES2/SP 1.3.4 MOD TO MAKE THE DEFAULT TSU AND STC MESSAGE
          CLASS A FOR JOBS THAT THEY SUBMIT.  THIS ALLOWS YOU TO STILL
          SET THE &STCMCLAS AND &TSUMCLAS TO A DELETE CLASS TO KEEP
          FROM GETTING ALL OF THE USELESS JCL AND STILL NOT HAVE TO PUT
          A MSGCLASS= PARM ON ALL JOBCARDS.  YOU DON'T NEED THIS IF YOU
          HAVE TSO/E FOR TSO BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO THROW AWAY
          ON THAT KIND OF PRODUCT AND WE ALSO HAVE A COUPLE OF STC'S
          THAT SUBMIT JOBS AND THIS HAS BEEN INDIPENSIBLE.
PRCJ2212- JES2/SP 1.3.4 MOD TO ADD $EXIT 212 TO HASPSTAM FOR DYNAMIC
          DUMPER/LOADER DSN'S.
PRCM0001- SET IEALIMIT TO NOT GIVE ANY EXTRA MEMORY.  IN MOST SHOPS
          POEPLE DON'T CARE ABOUT GIVING A JOB A LITTLE EXTRA, BUT
          OUR ACCOUNTING SYSTEM IS MEMORY INTENSIVE SO WE CAN'T
          ALLOW JOBS TO GET ANY MORE THAN THEY ASK FOR.
PRCM0002- THIS MOD WILL ALLOW DEFAULT TSO DYNAMIC ALLOCATION TO
          BE SHR INSTEAD OF OLD.  THIS IS FOR NON-TSO/E SYSTEMS,
          IF YOU HAVE TSO/E THERE IS ALREADY ANOTHER MOD ON THE CBT
          TAPE FOR THIS SAME TYPE OF THING. BUT IT IS ALOT BIGGER.
          I GUESS THAT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY PAY FOR TSO/E.
PRCM0003- THIS MOD MUST BE APPLIED WITH THE PRCM0004 MOD WHICH IS ON
PRCM0004  THIS SAME FILE.  THE FIRST ONE IS A DUMMY MOD SO THAT I WILL
          BE INFORMED IF THERE IS ANY MAINTENANCE THAT EFFECTS THIS MOD
          BEFORE ITS TOO LATE.  YOU DON'T NEED TO PUT IT ON IF YOU DON'T
          WANT TO.  THIS MOD WILL PUT THE EXCP COUNTS ON THE IEF285I
          MESSAGE THAT COMES OUT ON YOUR JOB LISTING IE.
          IEF285I  C7BRIAN.VTOC.LOAD      KEPT       2123 EXCP
          IEF285I  DATASET.NAME           KEPT          0 EXCP
PRCM0005- MOD TO ALLOW YOU TO HAVE TSO DEFAULT ALLOCATE TO PACKS THAT
          ARE NOT MOUNTED AS PUBLIC OR STORAGE.  IT COMES WITH A PROGRAM
          CALLED EX99 WHICH IS THE ACTUAL PCF EXIT THAT IS USED. YOU
          DO NOT HAVE TO HAVE PCF TO USE THIS MOD. WE DON'T HAVE IT
          AND WE RUN FINE.  YOU CAN SET THE ATTR2 FIELD IN THE PSCB TO
          ANY VOLUME THAT YOU WANT OR YOU CAN USE THE SETVOL PROGRAM
          ON THIS FILE TO DO IT FOR YOU AUTOMATICALLY
PRCM0010- THIS MOD WILL ELIMINATE THE DATASET NOT FREED; IS NOT
          ALLOCATED MESSAGE. FROM THE TSO ALLOC COMMAND.
PRCM0017- THIS MOD WILL ELIMINATE THE CN(00) BEING APPEND TO MESSAGES
          FROM THE OPERATOR AND ON THE NOTIFY OF JOB ENDED STUFF.
TALK ---- CLIST TO DO ISPF FULL SCREEN SENDS TO PEOPLE
TALKP---- PANEL TO USE WITH THE TALK CLIST (PUT IT IN ISPPLIB CONCAT)
ULX..---- ISPF BASED VTOC ANALYSIS AND REPORTING FACILITY
USAGE   - TSO COMMAND TO DISPLAY SESSION COST.
WAITPROG- RUNS AS A BATHC JOB AND WILL ACCEPT A PARM THAT HAS THE
          NUMBER OF SECONDS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO WAIT AND DISPLAYS
          IT ON THE OS CONSOLE FOR THE OPERATOR IT HIGHLIGHTS IT AND
          WILL NOT ROLL OFF THE SCREEN.  WHEN THE TIME EXPIRES IT WILL
          ISSUE A DOM TO DELETE THE MESSAGE AND PUT OUT A REGULAR
          MESSAGE ABOUT REQUESTED TIME EXPIRED. THE JOBNAME IS ALSO
          PUT IN BOTH MESSAGES.
XJ2PTP -- THIS IS A JES 2.1.5 EXIT TO DRAIN ALL OF THE TP LINES IN
          THE NETWORK WITH A SINGLE COMMAND $PTP. IT IS EXTREMELY
          USEFULL EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE OVER 600 LINES LIKE US.
          YOU CAN ALSO START ALL TP WITH $STP OR RESTART WITH
          $ETP TO ACCOMPLISH A LOT OF WORK QUICKLY.
XJ2NET -- THIS IS A JES2 EXIT13 WHICH IS REQUIRED IF YOU WANT
          TO NOTIFY A TSO USER WHEN DATA IS RECEIVED FROM ANOTHER
          JES NODE. IT ADDS SOME NEAT STUFF LIKE HOW MANY LINES
          AND SUCH.

          TSOTABL AND NODTABL WHICH ARE LOADED DYNAMICALLY AND CAN
          BE CHANGED ON THE FLY.  THIS EXIT WILL ALLOW STUFF TO BE
          ALLOCATED OR RENAMED ONLY TO THE PACKS WHICH WE DECIDE
          SHOULD GET THE PREFIXES.  THIS EXIT IS VERY POWERFUL AND
          IS EXTREMELY VERSATILE.  THIS EXIT REQUIRES THE  MACROS
          CONNECT, EQUREGS, RELEASE, SETAMODE WHICH ARE ALSO
          INCLUDED IN THIS DATASET.
