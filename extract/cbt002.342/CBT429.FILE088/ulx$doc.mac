 TO INSTALL,
   1) ASSEMBLE AND LINK-EDIT ULXL01 (OR JUST LINK-EDIT ULXO01)
      INTO ONE OF THE FOLLOWING, AND NAME IT ULXL01.
         A) A LINKLIST LIBRARY
         B) LPALIB  (IN WHICH CASE AN IPL WITH CLPA IS REQUIRED)
         C) ANY LIBRARY THAT IS ALLOCATED TO DDNAME ISPLLIB AT THE TIME
            ISPF IS ENTERED.

   2) COPY THE PANELS AND THE HELP INTO YOUR PANEL LIBRARY.

   3) COPY THE MESSAGE MEMBER INTO YOUR ISPF MESSAGE LIBRARY.

 AT THIS POINT YOU CAN TEST IT USING THE 'DIALOG TEST' FACILITY OF
 ISPF.  FROM THE PRIMARY OPTION MENU, ENTER 7.1 AND THEN WHEN YOU GET
 THE 'INVOKE DIALOG FUNCTION' SELECTION MENU, ENTER 'ULXL01' ON THE
 'INVOKE PROGRAM' PGM ===> LINE.

 IF IT WORKS, YOU CAN ADD IT TO YOUR PRIMARY OPTION MENU OR ONE OF THE
 THE UTILITY MENUS OR ONE OF YOUR OWN MENUS.  I WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO
 EXPLAIN HOW TO DO THAT HERE EXCEPT TO SAY THAT IT INVOLVES ADDING
 A STATEMENT THAT LOOKS LIKE THIS:
        SPACE,'PGM(ULXL01)'
 TO THE ')PROC' SECTION OF ONE OF YOUR MENUS, AND YOU CAN CHANGE THE
 WORD 'SPACE' TO WHATEVER YOU WANT.
