I've added COBOL II versions of the source programs that have been
written in VS/COBOL.  When I first wrote these programs, I thought they
would last forever, because I used such simple language.  However,
such is life.....  Anyway, the COBOL II versions have the number 2
somewhere in their name.  Conversion was done with the IBM Cobol
Conversion Aid, release 2.  I feel like an application programmer.
It serves me right for writing in VS/COBOL, but it was quick and dirty.

The COBOL II versions of these programs have compiled cleanly with the
LE/370 Cobol compiler.  Jobs to compile the 3 programs are members:
IGYWCL1, IGYWCL2, IGYWCL3. The LE/370 versions of the programs
have executed correctly during my tests.
