//*   TO CREATE A SEQUENTIAL SMPPTFIN-FORMAT FILE FROM MY SMP PTS
//*            AND TO CREATE SYSMOD LISTS FOR EACH FMID.
//*
//*
//*      1.  I USED THE PDS PROGRAM TO GENERATE IEBCOPY SELECT
//*             STATEMENTS - THIS PROGRAM IS ON CBT TAPE FILE 182.
//*             THE PDS COMMAND IS:
//*                  OUTCOPY A:Z
//*      2.  I ALLOCATED A PDS (ROUGHLY THE SIZE OF THE SMPPTS)
//*             ON A WORK PACK, AND CREATED AN IEBCOPY JOB USING
//*             THE SELECT STATEMENTS OBTAINED IN STEP 1.
//*             THIS COPIES THE NON-CONTROL MEMBERS OF THE PTS,
//*             WHICH ARE THE SYSMODS.
//*           ( IF YOU HAVE SMP/E, YOU CAN SKIP STEPS 1 AND 2,
//*             BECAUSE SMP/E'S PTS DOESN'T KEEP CONTROL MEMBERS,
//*             ONLY ACTUAL SYSMODS. )
//*      3.  USE THE OFFLOAD SAMPLE JCL - MEMBER JCL1 OF THIS DATASET
//*             TO CREATE THE SEQUENTIAL DATASET FROM THE PDS.
//*      4.  USE THE SAMPLE JCL IN MEMBER JCL2 TO CREATE THE PUTXREF
//*             REPORT AND THE SMP CONTROL CARD DECKS BY FMID.
//*             USE THIS JCL FOR ANY SMPPTFIN-FORMAT INPUT.
