       REMARKS.

           THIS PROGRAM READS A PTF FILE FROM A PUT TAPE, AND
           CREATES AN IDENTICAL OUTPUT FILE, EXCEPT THAT ALL
           './' IN COLUMN 1 ARE CONVERTED TO '><',
           AND A ./ ADD NAME=PTFNAME IS INSERTED BEFORE EACH
           PTF BEGINS.  THE PDSLOAD PROGRAM CAN THEN BE USED TO
           LOAD THE OUTPUT FILE FROM THIS PROGRAM INTO A PDS.
           THAT PDS WILL HAVE EACH MEMBER AS A SINGLE PTF.
           NOTE THAT ON OCCASION, IBM WILL SEND 2 PTFS WITH
           THE SAME NUMBER ON A PUT TAPE.  TO FIND THE DELETED
           MEMBER OF THE RESULTANT PDS, YOU SHOULD DO A PDS
           RESTORE, USING THE PDS TSO COMMAND PROCESSOR FROM
           THE CBT TAPE, FILE 182.

           MODIFIED 09/30/87 TO DEBUG CASE WHERE OPEN PAREN
           CAME AFTER ++PTF WITH NO SPACE IN BETWEEN.  ALSO
           TO ADD SUPPORT FOR ++APAR, ++USERMOD, AND ++FUNCTION.
