* THE 'SET CLOCK COMPARATOR' ENTRY POINT OF THE
* TIMER SUPERVISOR MODULE IS INVOKED BY TQE ENQUE AND DEQUE
* SERVICES WHEN A TQE IS ADDED OR REMOVED FROM THE REAL TIME
* QUEUE. THIS ZAP IS ENTERED WHEN THAT ROUTINE HAS DETERMINED
* THAT THE FIRST TQE IS NOT BEING TIMED OR THAT
* THE CURRENT CPU IS NOT TIMING ANYTHING.
* UNDER THIS APPROACH, A TQE CAN BE SIMULTANEOUSLY TIMED ON
* BOTH CPUS IN AN MP OR AP CONFIGURATION, BUT IT IS NOT
* ALWAYS DOUBLY TIMED. THE GUARANTEE THAT CPUS ARE
* EACH TIMING SOMETHING APPEARS TO BE A RELIABILITY FEATURE
* TO RECOVER TIMING SHOULD ONE CLOCK COMPARATOR SUDDENLY STOP
* GENERATING INTERRUPTS.
* THERE ARE TWO POSSIBLE
* DISPOSITIONS OF THE TQE:
*   1) A BRANCH TO 'RET' WILL RETURN TO THE NORMAL LOGIC AND
*      WILL CAUSE THE CLOCK COMPARATOR ON THIS CPU TO BE SET
*      TO THE TQEVAL VALUE IN THE TQE POINTED TO BY R11.
*   2) A BRANCH TO NOQUE WILL BYPASS PROCESSING FOR ANY TQE
*      CAUSING THE CLOCK COMPARATOR FOR THIS CPU TO REMAIN
*      UNCHANGED.
* THIS IDENTICAL CODE CAN BE INVOKED ON THE OTHER CPU IN AN MP
* OR AP ENVIRONMENT BY ISSUING A RPSGNL MACRO AS IS DONE BELOW.
* HENSE, OPTION 2) DOES NOT NECESSARILY LEAVE THE TQE 'HANGING'
* AS LONG AS THE OTHER CPU IS NOTIFIED TO PICK IT UP.
* THERE IS A LITTLE KLUGE IN THIS CODE FOR WHICH APOLOGIES ARE
* DUE. TO AVOID USING RESERVED BITS IN THE TQE, WE USE THE LOW
* ORDER 8 BITS OF THE TOD TIME STAMP IN 'TQEVAL'. SINCE THE
* STCK INSTRUCTION ON ALL 370 COMPUTERS LEAVE THE LOW ORDER 12
* BITS ZERO, THESE BITS ARE ALL USUALLY OFF. IF THEY ARE ALMOST
* ALL ON (SEE BELOW), THEN THIS IS TREATED AS AN INDICATION OF
* CPU AFFINITY. NOTE THAT NO JOB IS IMPACTED ADVERSLY BY
* INADVERTENTLY BEING CAUGHT BY THIS TRAP.
