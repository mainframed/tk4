THIS PDS CONTAINS ALL THE SOURCE CODE, JCL, AND DOCUMENTATION FOR
THE COMPLETE DISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEM OF PEOPLES NATIONAL BANK OF
WASHINGTON.  ALL DISK MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS REQUIRE CUSTOMIZATION TO
FIT THE PARTICULAR NEEDS OF EACH INSTALLATION.  EXTENSIVE
CUSTOMIZATION DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED IN THE DOCPROG (PROGRAMMER'S
DOCUMENTATION) MEMBER.  RUN PROCEDURES, REPORT FORMATS, AND RECORD
LAYOUTS ARE PROVIDED IN DOCUSER (USER'S DOCUMENTATION).  SAMPLE JCL
AND CONTROL FILES ARE PROVIDED IN OTHER MEMBERS OF THIS PDS.
THE DOCUMENTATION IS IN 'RDOC72' FORMAT.  IT SHOULD BE PRINTED USING
THE RDOC72 PROGRAM PROVIDED IN THE PEOPLES NATIONAL BANK OF WASHINGTON
UTILITIES PDS.  THIS PDS IS FILE 040 ON THIS TAPE.  THE UTILITIES PDS
ALSO CONTAINS COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION ON RDOC72 AND A MACRO 'REGS'
THAT IS USED IN MANY OF THE ASSEMBLER PROGRAMS IN THIS PDS.

TO BEGIN INSTALLATION COMPILE THE RDOC72 PROGRAM OUT OF THE UTILITIES
PDS AND PRINT OFF THE DOCUMENTATION IN MEMBERS DOCPROG AND DOCUSER
IN THIS PDS.  SAMPLE JCL FOR RDOC72 CAN BE FOUND IN THE UTILITIES PDS.
THE FIRST SECTION OF DOCPROG CONTAINS A DISK MANAGEMENT POLICY
STATEMENT.  READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY.  YOU CAN'T DO DISK MANAGEMENT
WITHOUT A POLICY.  THE PROGRAMS AND PROCEDURES IN THIS PDS MERELY
IMPLEMENT THE POLICY.  EXAMINE THIS POLICY TO SEE IF IT WILL FIT
YOUR SITUATION WITH MINOR MODIFICATIONS.  IF IT WILL THEN YOU CAN
MODIFY THESE PROGRAMS AND USE THEM TO IMPLEMENT DISK MANAGEMENT IN YOUR
SHOP.  IF YOU FIND THAT THE POLICY CANNOT BE MADE TO FIT YOUR SITUATION
WITHOUT DRASTIC MODIFICATIONS THEN THIS MATERIAL WILL BE OF MUCH LESS
VALUE TO YOU.

GOOD LUCK.
