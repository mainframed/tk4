+ NEW/OLD/MOD/SHR  You may specify the disposition to be used for
+                  the data set you are receiving into. If you DO
+                  NOT specify one of these values AND you also
+                  DID NOT specify the SPACE keyword, RECEIVE will

+ PARM             You may specify a character string to be passed

+ SYSOUT           You may specify a SYSOUT class which will be
