+
+
+        Using the outline methodology of using LIBDEF services, users
+        can safely invoke ISPF applications from standard IBM menus
+        and always be safe from changes in system library names. New
+        release of the ISPF and ISPF/PDF products can cause library
+        name changes.  Plus, new third party vendor products added by
+        the systems personnel can causes allocations of libraries to
+        change without notice.  Use of this user interface will mean
+        no interruption of service to our user community.
+
+
+        If you have any questions, please call or visit your local
+        Technical support office.
