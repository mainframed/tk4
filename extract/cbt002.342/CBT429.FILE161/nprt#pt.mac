%              Transfer a File to a VM Printer
+
+     This is 2ISG's  solution for  users  wanting to  send a file to be
+  printed on  one of  2ISG's VM systems. The file to be printed will be
+  sent to a  VM system over the%Network Job Entry+(NJE) link. The panel
+  asks you  to  specify the  node  name of the  appropriate  VM  system
+  (%VM1+or%VM2+or%VM3+).   The copy is done using a batch job submitted
+  to the MVS batch system.   The existence of the file is checked prior
+  to the submission of the batch job. If the file does not  exist or is
+  not cataloged, the request is  denied. Also if a user wants  to print
+  a member of a PDS, a check is  made to see if the  member  exists (if
+  it does not exist, you are told.  Also if an  incorrect  VM  printer
+  name is specified, then you will be told.
