%           Implementation of USER Applications in ISPF/PDF
+
+
+         ISPF/PDF is a tool to provide users with full-screen EDIT and
+    utility capabilities.  IBM's provided PANELS have been extended to
+    give users additional capability.  A user may use this capability
+    and create ISPF/PDF PANELS, CLISTS, SKELETONS, MESSAGES, and
+    TABLES.  The MASTER panel has an option for your developed ISPF
+    system.  The following is a method of exploiting this option
+    without altering any of the provided dataset names:
+
+
+      1.  Place a CLIST in your 'userid.ISPF.PROFILE' called
+    AUTOEXEC to do allocations of your own PANEL, MESSAGE, SKELETON,
+    and TABLE libraries.  You will exploit the LIBDEF facility of
+    ISPF/PDF.
