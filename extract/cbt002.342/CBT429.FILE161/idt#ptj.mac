%            Interactive Data Transmission Facility
+
+       This facility allows  you to transmit  and receive  data between
+   nodes in a network. You will use two commands, TRANSMIT and RECEIVE,
+   to send or receive sequential or partitioned data sets.  For example
+   when you issue the  TRANSMIT command,  the data set you requested to
+   transmit is read,  the records are  converted to  a format  suitable
+   for  transmission,  header  information is  added,  and  the data is
+   routed  to a class B  SYSOUT  PUNCH  file  that is  directed to  the
+   receiving  node  and  userid.  The data routed to the receiving node
+   is queued on the  JES SPOOL.  When a  user at the  receiving  userid
+   issues the  RECEIVE  command,  that user is told that a data set has
+   arrived,  and is  given the name of the  data set  and the  node and
+   userid of the  sender.  The user might  then specify the  name  of a
+   data set in which the  data should  be stored.  The data is restored
+   to its orginal format,   and is written  into the data set indicated
+   by the user.
+
+       VM users can  transmit  files to TSO  users from VM/CMS systems.
+   TSO users may transmit files to VM/CMS users in the defined network.
