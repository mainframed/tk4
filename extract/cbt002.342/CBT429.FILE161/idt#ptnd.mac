+ When defining a nickname, you must at least specify :NICK and
+ :USERID.  The value of :NODE if not specified is your system's
+ nodename.  Also note that the period (.) must immediately follow
+ the "tag.", however the data may follow by one or more blanks.
+ A nickname entry consists of all the data inbetween two :NICK
+ "tags".  Other user "tags." which are not recognized by the
+ TRANSMIT and RECEIVE commands may be inbetween the supported
+ "tag" and its data (e.g. :NODE.  :NETNAME.  POK) where the
+ value of POK is associated with the :NODE "tag".
