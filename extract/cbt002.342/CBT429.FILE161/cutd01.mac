HOW TO INSTALL THE CUT AND PASTE EDIT MACROS FOR YOUR USERID ONLY,
JUST TO TEST IT ONCE.

IT IS ASSUMED YOU CAN LOOK AT A JOB THAT LINKS AND COPIES SOFTWARE
INTO DEFAULT LIBRARIES AND MODIFY THAT JOB TO LINK AND COPY INTO YOUR
OWN USERID-OWNED LIBRARIES.

IT IS ASSUMED YOU KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT TSO TO TEMPORARILY CHANGE THE
ALLOCATIONS OF PANEL LIBRARIES (DDNAME ISPPLIB), CLIST LIBRARIES
(DDNAME SYSPROC) AND ISPF LOAD LIBRARIES (ISPLLIB) FOR YOUR SESSION
WITHOUT AFFECTING OTHER SESSIONS.

ON SOME SYSTEMS THE ALLOCATIONS ARE DONE IN LOGON PROCS, AND ON OTHERS
THEY ARE DONE BY A CLIST THAT IS EXECUTED TO ENTER ISPF. YOU MAY HAVE
TO WRITE A CLIST THAT UNDOES THESE ALLOCATIONS AND RE-DOES THEM
WITH AN ADDITONAL LIBRARY.

1) CREATE A LOAD LIBRARY NAMED CUT.LOAD, ONE TRACK, ONE DIR BLOCK,
   RECFM=U BLKSIZE=6144.  FULL NAME = YOURUSERID.CUT.LOAD

2) CREATE A CLIST LIBRARY NAMED CUT.CLIST, ONE TRACK, ONE DIR BLOCK,
   RECFM=FB LRECL=80 BLKSIZE=3120. FULL NAME = YOURUSERID.CUT.CLIST


3) CREATE A PANEL LIBRARY NAMED CUT.PANELS, ONE TRACK, ONE DIR BLOCK,
   RECFM=FB LRECL=80 BLKSIZE=3120 OR WHATEVER YOUR PANEL LIBRARIES ARE.
   FULL NAME = YOURUSERID.CUT.PANELS

STEPS 4, 5, 6, 7, AND 8 CAN BE DONE BY SUBMITTING THE JOBS IN 'CUTJ01'
BUT YOU SHOULD READ THE REST OF THESE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE SUBMITTING
THE JOB.  THE JOB WILL HAVE TO BE TAILORED TO YOUR INSTALLATION.

4) ASSEMBLE 'CUTL01' AND LINK IT INTO YOURUSERID.CUT.LOAD
   GIVING IT A MEMBER NAME OF 'CUT'

5) ASSEMBLE 'CUTL02' AND LINK IT INTO YOURUSERID.CUT.LOAD
   GIVING IT A MEMBER NAME OF 'PASTE'

6) COPY 'CUTH01' AND 'CUTH02' INTO YOURUSERID.CUT.PANELS

7) COPY 'CUTC01' INTO YOURUSERID.CUT.CLIST RENAMING IT TO 'CUT'.

8) COPY 'CUTC02' INTO YOURUSERID.CUT.CLIST RENAMING IT TO 'PASTE'.

9) GET OUT OF ISPF.  IF YOU ALWAYS USE A CLIST TO GET INTO ISPF,
   GO TO STEP 14.

10) STILL OUT OF ISPF, ADD CUT.PANELS TO YOUR CONCATENATION
   OF PANEL LIBRARIES (DDNAME ISPPLIB). ADD IT TO THE END.

11) STILL OUT OF ISPF, ADD CUT.CLIST TO YOUR CONCATENATION OF
   CLIST LIBRARIES (DDNAME SYSPROC). PUT IT FIRST IN THE LIST.
   IF SYSPROC IS NOT ALLOCATED AT ALL, ALLOCATE IT TO CUT.CLIST.

12) STILL OUT OF ISPF, ADD CUT.LOAD TO YOUR CONCATENATION
   OF LOAD LIBRARIES (DDNAME ISPLLIB). PUT IT FIRST IN THE LIST.
   IF ISPLLIB IS NOT ALLOCATED AT ALL, ALLOCATE IT TO CUT.LOAD.

13) GO BACK INTO ISPF USING A METHOD THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE A CLIST.
    EDIT SOMETHING AND ENTER "CUT ?" ON THE COMMAND LINE. INSTALL DONE.
    YOU WILL HAVE TO REPEAT STEPS 10, 11, AND 12 EACH TIME YOU LOGON,
    SO WRITE A CLIST THAT PERFORMS THAT FUNCTION IF YOU WISH TO GO ON
    USING THIS VERSION OF CUT AND PASTE.
    END OF INSTALL.

14) HERE FROM STEP 9. SKIP THIS STEP IF YOU DID STEP 13.
   IF YOU ALWAYS USE A CLIST TO GET INTO ISPF, COPY THAT CLIST TO
   CUT.CLIST AS MEMBER 'ISPF', EDIT IT SO THAT ANY ALLOCATIONS
   OF ISPPLIB WILL INCLUDE CUT.PANELS,
   OF SYSPROC WILL INCLUDE CUT.CLIST,
   OF ISPLLIB WILL INCLUDE CUT.LOAD (ADD ONE IF THERE IS NONE)
   AND USE THAT CLIST TO GET INTO ISPF BY ENTERING "%ISPF" AND ANY
   OPERANDS YOUR OTHER CLIST MAY REQUIRE.
    EDIT SOMETHING AND ENTER "CUT ?" ON THE COMMAND LINE.
    END OF INSTALL.
