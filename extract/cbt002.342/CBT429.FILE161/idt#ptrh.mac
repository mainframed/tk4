+ RELEASE          You may request RECEIVE to release any unused
+                  space associated with the data set just received
+                  by specifying this parameter.
+
+ DIRECTORY        You may override the number of directory blocks
+                  for a partitioned data set by specifying this
+                  parameter.  The default value for the DIRECTORY
+                  keyword is the number of directory blocks required
+                  to receive the transmitted members.
+
+                  NOTE:  If you are receiving a sequential data set
+                  as a NEW partitioned data set, DATASET(x(member01)),
+                  and you do NOT specify the DIRECTORY keyword, the
+                  RECEIVE command assumes a default directory block
+                  value of 27.
+
+ BLKSIZE          You may specifiy the blocksize to be used when
+                  receiving the input file from the Job Entry
+                  Subsystem. Your value will be used as long as
+                  it does not conflict with the existing data set
+                  characteristics or device type characteristics.
