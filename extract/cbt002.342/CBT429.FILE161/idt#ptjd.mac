+   understand partitioned files and does not support the  IBM  IEBCOPY
+   utility. TSO users may TRANSMIT members of PDS's sequentially to VM
+   users.  Since these  are sent in true sequential form, then VM will
+   know how handle the file.
+
+      TSO users may send sequential or partitioned files to other  TSO
+   users using TRANSMIT. When TSO users invoke RECEIVE, they are shown
+   what files are available to process.  Each file is presented to the
+   user and the options of  saving  the file,  deleteing the file,  or
+   simply saying  END.   End  processing on the  transmitted file will
+   cause nothing to be  done with the  file  and it is available again
+   when the  user invokes  RECEIVE.  To retrieve the  file,  the  user
+   should  specify  an existing file or the name of a new file to have
+   RECEIVE  processing  allocate and  copy the incoming file.  This is
+   by replying for example:
+
+                         DA(FILE.DATA)
+
+   This will cause a dynamic allocation of a new file on DASD for the
+   file 'userid.FILE.DATA' in the correct format (sequential or PDS).
