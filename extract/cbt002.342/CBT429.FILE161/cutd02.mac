HOW TO INSTALL THE CUT AND PASTE EDIT MACROS SYSTEM-WIDE

1) MAKE SURE THERE ARE NOT ALREADY SOME MEMBERS NAMED 'CUT' OR 'PASTE'
   IN THE SYSTEM LINKLIST LIBRARIES (OR LPA, OR TSO SESSION STEPLIBS).
   IF THERE ARE, YOU WILL EITHER HAVE TO RENAME THE ONES YOU HAVE OR
   THE ONES YOU ARE ABOUT TO INSTALL.

2) MAKE SURE THERE ARE NOT ALREADY SOME MEMBERS NAMED 'CUT' OR 'PASTE'
   IN THE TSO SYSPROC CLIST LIBRARIES.
   IF THERE ARE, YOU WILL EITHER HAVE TO RENAME THE ONES YOU HAVE OR
   THE ONES YOU ARE ABOUT TO INSTALL.

3) MAKE SURE THERE ARE NOT ALREADY SOME MEMBERS NAMED 'CUTH01' OR
   'CUTH02' IN YOUR TSO ISPF PANEL LIBRARIES.
   IF THERE ARE, YOU WILL EITHER HAVE TO RENAME THE ONES YOU HAVE OR
   THE ONES YOU ARE ABOUT TO INSTALL.  IF YOU RENAME THE ONES YOU ARE
   ABOUT TO INSTALL, YOU WILL HAVE TO CHANGE THE REFERENCES TO NAMES
   'CUTH01' AND 'CUTH02' IN THE SOURCE CODE BEFORE ASSEMBLING IT.

STEPS 4, 5, 6, 8, AND 9 CAN BE DONE BY SUBMITTING THE JOBS IN 'CUTJ02'
BUT YOU SHOULD READ THE REST OF THESE INSTRUCTIONS BEFORE SUBMITTING
THE JOB.  THE JOB WILL HAVE TO BE TAILORED TO YOUR INSTALLATION.

4) ASSEMBLE 'CUTL01' AND LINK IT INTO A SYSTEM LINKLIST LIBRARY OR TSO
   STEPLIB OR TSO ISPLLIB, GIVING IT A MEMBER NAME OF 'CUT' (OR
   SOMETHING LIKE 'XCUT' IF NECESSARY TO AVOID A CONFLICT).

5) ASSEMBLE 'CUTL02' AND LINK IT INTO A SYSTEM LINKLIST LIBRARY OR TSO
   STEPLIB OR TSO ISPLLIB, GIVING IT A MEMBER NAME OF 'PASTE' (OR
   SOMETHING LIKE 'XPASTE' IF NECESSARY TO AVOID A CONFLICT).

6) COPY 'CUTH01' AND 'CUTH02' INTO ONE OF YOUR ISPF PANEL LIBRARIES,
   RENAMING THEM IF NECESSARY.

7) AT THIS POINT IT IS POSSIBLE TO TEST THE COMMANDS BY ENTERING
     !CUT ?   OR  !PASTE ?   ON THE COMMAND LINE IN ISPF/PDF EDIT.
   ( !XCUT ?   OR  !XPASTE ?    IF YOU CHANGED THE NAMES IN STEPS 4&5.)
   YOU ONLY NEED THE EXCLAMATION POINT THE FIRST TIME YOU USE THE
   COMMAND AFTER ENTERING ISPF.  FOR THE REST OF THE SESSION YOU CAN
   OMIT IT.  THE NEXT STEPS INSTALL CLISTS THAT ELIMINATE THE NEED
   TO USE THE EXCLAMATION POINT THE FIRST TIME.

8) COPY 'CUTC01' TO ONE OF YOUT SYSPROC CLIST LIBRARIES, RENAMING IT
   TO 'CUT' OR 'XCUT' OR WHATEVER NAME YOU USED IN STEP 4 LINKEDIT.

9) COPY 'CUTC02' TO ONE OF YOUT SYSPROC CLIST LIBRARIES, RENAMING IT
   TO 'PASTE' OR 'XPASTE' OR WHATEVER NAME YOU USED IN STEP 5 LINKEDIT.
