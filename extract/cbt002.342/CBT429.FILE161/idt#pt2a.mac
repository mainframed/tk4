+         This panel will send a file to a TSO user or VM/CMS user on
+     on another system. You must enter the system node name of where
+     the receiving user resides. After that, enter the userid of the
+     user (there is no validity check to ensure that the ID actually
+     exists).
+
+         Next you must  enter the file type; SEQ or PDS. In the file
+     transfer  TRANSMIT  will  know  if  the  file  is sequential or
+     partitioned by the file type.   But in the case of transmitting
+     files to VM,  the VM system can  not unload PDS files sent with
+     the MVS utility IEBCOPY. Therefore only sequential files should
+     be sent to VM or members of PDS's transmitted sequentially.
+
+         NOTIFY is a request of the TRANSMIT  command to indicate to
+     RECEIVE command  that  RECEIVE should  transmit  a notification
+     to you when the addressee has  received the  data  sent by you.
+     For users of nicknames or distribution lists, your notification
+     requests are  controlled  by the  :/NOTIFY/:NONOTIFY tag in the
+     names data set.
