              RELEASE 18   1 OCTOBER 1999 "MAJOR Y2K AND POPUP RELEASE"

              COURTESY     JIM MARSHALL, CAPT, USAF-RET
                           DEPT OF TREASURY / FINANCIAL MGMT SERVICE

            ---------------------------------------------------------
            THIS FILE IS A GOOD EXAMPLE OF A PERSON WHO IS WRITING ISPF/
            PDF PANELS, ETC AND DOESN'T KNOW WHAT IT IS ALL ABOUT. BUT
            IT WORKS !!!!!! SO IS IT THAT BAD? (IT MIGHT INSPIRE SOMEONE
            TO WRITE MORE). MOST OF THIS FILE ARE ISPF/PDF GOODIES FOR
            STRAIGHT TSO TYPE FUNCTIONS. NOW THAT WE HAVE ISPF/PDF, OUR
            USERS (AND SOME SYSTEMS TYPES) ARE LOST IF IT ISN'T SITTING
            ON A MENU, ETC.  SO AFTER TRYING TO GET THEM TO USE TSO AS
            TSO, I STARTED TO PUT SOME THINGS INTO MENUS, PANELS, ETC.
            THEY LOVE IT. SO WHO CAN ARGUE WITH SUCCESS. AS I SAID,
            THIS IS MY FIRST ATTEMPT AT CODING THIS STUFF, SO I WILL
            BE ADDING , SUBTRACTING, REFINING, ETC AS TIME GOES BY.

            MY GOAL IS TO WRITE ISPF/PDF MENUS, ECT AND MODIFY AS LITTLE
            IBM LIBRARIES AS POSSIBLE. SO TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO DO THIS
            YOU MUST COMPREHEND THE FILES YOU CAN ALLOCATE IN LOGON
            PROCEDURE OF A TSO USER THAT HAVE TO DO WITH ISPF/PDF
            PANELS, ETC.


            THERE ARE MORE DD CARDS IN THE LOGON PROC BUT THESE ARE
            THE ONES  HAVE BEARING HERE. THE ONLY MODIFICATION I WILL
            MAKE IS TO 'ISR@PRIM' IN IBM'S PANEL LIBRARY (THIS IS THE
            MASTER PANEL). COPY THIS ONE TO OUR PANEL LIBRARY WHICH IS
            CONCATENATED  AHEAD OF IBM'S. ALL OTHER LIBRARIES ARE JUST
            CONCATENTATED WITH IBM'S. SINCE MY GOAL IS NOT TO CHANGEIBM
            SCREENS ETC, WE WILL HAVE NO PROBLEM. NOW ALL WE DO IS PLACE
            PANELS IN 'PANEL' LIBRARIES, MSGS IN 'MSG' LIBRARIES, ETC.

            HINT: OR USE 'USR#' INTERFACE DESCRIBED BELOW !!!!

            PHASE 2 OF THIS DISCUSSION SAYS I DO NOT WANT TO HAVE A
            LOGON PROC FOR EVERY USER WHO WRITES APPLICATIONS. THIS
            IF YOU LOOK AT THE SERIES OF THINGS CALLED 'USER#' I HAVE
            A SUGGESTED INTERFACE USING THE 'LIBDEF' PHILOSOPHY AND
            USE OF THE TSO "ALTLIB" FACILITY.  THERE EXISTS A TSO
            COMMAND CALLED 'CONCAT' FOR USERS TO GET THE NEEDED
            LIBRARIES IN SPECIAL CASES. SINCE THE ADVENT OF "ALTLIB",
            THE USAGE OF 'CONCAT' SHOULD DECREASE.
            ---------------------------------------------------------

                     D I S C L A I M E R     !!!!!
                 *************************************
               USE ALL OF THESE AT YOUR OWN RISK, NATURALLY!
                 *************************************

            ---------------------------------------------------------
           THE FILE IS CONSTRUCTED OF MEMBERS AS FOLLOWS: THE PANEL IS
           PUT IN AS A NAME TRAILED WITH A #PN (N IF MORE THAN 1),
           THE SKELETON IS THE NAME TRAILED WITH A #SN (N IF MORE THAN
           1), AND THE CLIST IS THE NAME TRAILED WITH A #CN (N IF MORE
           THAN 1).

           NOTE1: HAVE YET TO INCORPORATE SOME TUTORIALS, MSGS, ETC.
                  WHEN I DO, THE PHILOSOPHY IS THAT ALL ITEMS WILL
                  FALL TOGETHER.
           NOTE2: SOME OF THE TUTORIAL MATERIAL IS REALLY TUTORIALS
                  IN THE PUREST SENSE, THEY ARE PANELS, SO THEY BELONG
                  IN THE PANEL LIBRARY.
           NOTE3: SOME OF MY CLISTS ARE NOT TOO ELEGANT. MY STYLE IS
                  TO KEEP THINGS SIMPLE AND NOT TRY TO IMPRESS WITH
                  SLICK CODING TRICKS.

           FOR EXAMPLE:   CMD#P   - PANEL FOR THE COMMAND
                          CMD#S   - SKELETON FOR THE COMMAND
                          CMD#C   - CLIST FOR THE COMMAND
                          CMDNN   - MSGS FOR THE COMMAND
                          CMD..   - MAY HAVE A SPECIAL ISPF ALC PGM

           -------------------------------------------------------
           NOTE: I GOT INSPIRATION FROM THE PRINTOFF AND VTOC PANELS
                 FOUND ON THE MODS TAPES. BUT I MODIFIED A LITTLE AND
                 REPACKAGED. IF BY CHANCE I HAVE LEFT ANYTHING OUT,
                 PLEASE LET ME KNOW, PUTTING A FILE TOGETHER IS HARD
                 TRYING TO INCLUDE ALL THE PIECES. ONCE YOU GET INTO
                 THIS STUFF IT IS LIKE EATING POTATO CHIPS !!!!!!

                       THEY MAY COMPLAIN &  BOSS BOWS TO PRESSURE
                       (THE WHIMP). SO YOU GIVE THE USER SOMETHING,
