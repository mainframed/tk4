+                    :NOTIFY or :NONOTIFY.  The value of :NONOTIFY in
+                    the names file may be overridden by a similiar
+                    specification on the TRANSMIT command.
+
+ :NICK.nickname     The :NICK tag is used to begin each nickname
+                    entry in the names file.  It must be the first
+                    non-blank (except for line numbers) characters
+                    of the record.  The nickname is any string of
+                    non-blank alpha-numeric characters 1- to
+                    8-characters in length.
+
+ :NODE.nodename     The :NODE tag is used within a nickname entry
+                    to specify a network node name for the nickname
+                    entry.  If the :NODE tag is not present in a
+                    nickname entry, your system's node name is assumed.
+
+ :USERID.userid     The :USERID tag identifies the userid of the
+                    addressee.  The :USERID tag may not be
+                    used in the same entry as the :LIST or :CC
+                    tags.
