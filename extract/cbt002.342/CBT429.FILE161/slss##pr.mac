 SLSS

    THIS IS A VARIATION OF SOME ISPF/PDF PANELS ON THE MODS TAPE TO
 KEEP TRACK TO YOUR MANUALS THROUGH SLSS. I SENT THE ORGINIAL STUFF
 TO CAPT JIM PETERSON AT NORTON AFB (AIR FORCE SAFETY & INSPECTION
 CENTER). WELL JIM DID NOT LIKE IT BECAUSE IT TOOK SO LONG TO RUN.
 SO JIM WROTE A COBOL PROGRAM TO REPLACE ALOT OF THE CLIST CODE AND
 A COBOL PRINT PROGRAM FOR LISTING.

    HE SENT THE CODE BACK TO ME AND I PUT THEN I PUT IT TOGETHER AND
 SHIPPED IT OUT. TRIED TO INSTALL 'SLSS' FROM THE WAY I HAD PUT IT
 ON THE TAPE AND GOT FRUSTRATED.  SO I TORE IT ALL APART AND REWROTE
 SOME OF THE COBOL CODE INTO CLISTS AND MADE SENSE OUT OF THE WHOLE
 MESS.  THEN I RE-INSTALLED AND WAS HAPPY.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------
 NOTES AND THOUGHTS:

 I LIKE THIS SLSS NOT BECAUSE I DID ANYTHING TO IT. IT GIVES ME AN
 EASY WAY TO FIND A MANUAL ON-LINE. ALSO IT WILL SHOW THE TNL THAT
 ARE BEING USED FOR A PARTICULAR MANUAL. THE REPORTS COME IN

       1. I PUT A ONE PAGE LOGO TYPE HEADER ON THE REPORT.
          TRASH IT, CHANGE IT, OR KEEP IT.

       2. SLSS SUBJECT LIST. TAKEN FROM SLSS#SS AND IS FIRST
          SO YOU CAN FIND THE CORRECT BALLPARK WHEN YOU HUNT
          FOR A MANUAL.

       3. SORTED BOOK REPORT. THIS IS A LISTING SORTED BY BOOK
          NUMBER MAJOR, TRIPLE SPACE BETWEEN EACH BOOK NUMBER.

       4. SORTED MANUAL REPORT.  THIS IS A LISTING OF MANUALS BY
          THE MANUAL NUMBER. I WILL TRIPLE SPACE BETWEEN EACH
          CONTROL BREAK OF THE 1ST 4 CHARACTERS (EXCLUDE DASH) OF
          OF THE MANUAL NUMBER, I.E.  GG22 GROUP, 3 SPACES, GG23,
          3 SPACES, ETC, ETC.

 WHEN I ORDER A MANUAL, I WILL PUT A BOOK NUMBER OF 9999 SINCE I
 REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT ACTUAL BOOK IT WILL FIT INTO.  SO WHEN I
 LIST OFF THE LIBRARY, ALL MANUALS ON ORDER WILL FALL TOGETHER.

 THE LISTINGS ARE ALL GENERATED FROM A 'FLAT' (SEQUENTIAL) FILE
 FROM THE CLIST. ALL I DO IS PACKAGE JCL AROUND IT AND USE WHAT-
 EVER IS AVAILABLE. WE HAVE 'SYNCSORT' AND IT HAS SOME REPORT
 GENERATING ABILITIES. YOU COULD USE YOUR OWN SORT FOLLOWED BY
 IEBPTPCH. I'LL TRY TO DOCUMENT THE JCL GENERATING THE REPORTS
 SO YOU CAN FIGURE THINGS OUT FOR NON-SYNCSORT PEOPLE.

 YOU ARE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO GIVE YOUR SLSS TOTALLY TO A SECRETARY
 TO DO !!!!!!!!  I SAY THIS AND IT SHOCKS MANAGEMENT FOR THEY FEEL
 THIS IS A TRIVIAL JOB. MY ONLY COMMENT IS THAT YOU CAN GET YOUR-
 SELF INTO TROUBLE BY HAVING A NON-DP PERSON HANDLE MANUALS TOTALLY.
 FOR-EXAMPLE:  YOU ARE RUNNING JES2/SP1.3.4 AND IBM SENDS YOU
 JES2/SP1.3.5 THAT IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT. WELL THE SECRETARY REPLACES
 AND THROWS AWAY ALL YOUR JES2/SP1.3.4 MANUALS; TRUE YOUR LIBRARY
 IS UP-TO-DATE BUT YOU HAVE BEEN JUST SHOT YOURSELF IN THE FOOT.
 SO MAY I MAKE A SUGGESTION. YOU NEED SOMEONE TO SCREEN WHAT BOOKS
 SHOULD GO IN IMMEDIATELY AND HOLD OUT BOOKS (LIKE A NEW VERSION
 OF JES2) FOR LATER UPDATE. BELIEVE IT OR NOT WE HAVE THE SYSTEMS
 MANAGER DO THIS (IT IS NOT OVERLY DIFFICULT AND CAN BE DONE IN SHORT
 BLOCKS OF TIME WHEN MANAGERS HAVE NOTHING TO DO - IS TRUE IF THEY
 DELEGATE CORRECTLY). NOW THE SECRETARY OR JUNIOR DP PERSON CAN DO
 THE ISPF APPLICATION UPDATE AND ACTUAL FILING. MY FEELING IS THAT
 A JUNIOR DP PERSON SHOULD DO THIS AS A PART OF THEIR MATURATION
 PROCESS.

    PANELS:

     SLSS#P    - MAIN PANEL FOR DISPLAY
     SLSS#PA   - ADD PANEL FOR UPDATING SLSS
     SLSS#PP   - PANEL FOR SLSS
     SLSS#PS   - PANEL FOR SLSS
     SLSS#PT1  - TUTORIAL PANEL FOR HELP.
     SLSS#PT2  - TUTORIAL PANEL FOR HELP.

    SKELETONS

     SLSS#SH   - MEMBER USED TO PRETTY UP THE 1ST PAGE OF PRINT.
     SLSS#SP   - SKELETON JCL FOR LISTING THE TABLE. ADD YOUR OWN
                 JOB CARD AND JECL.
     SLSS#SS   - SUBJECT CODES YOU SHOULD CUSTOMIZE. LOOK AT THEM AND
                 IT WILL JUMP OUT AT YOU.

    TSO CLISTS

     SLSS#C    - CLIST TO PROCESS THE SLSS


    PROGRAMS

     SLSSPRT   - SLSS PRINT PROGRAM  (COBOL)
     SLSSPRT$  - JCL USED TO INSTALL (NOTHING FANCY)

 INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS:

 1. SLSS#P   - CHANGE THE APPLICATION NAMES TO SUIT YOU AND WHAT YOU
               WANT TO DO. DON'T FORGET THE 'VER' STATEMENTS FOR THE
               CHECKING PURPOSES.

 2. SLSS#SH  - CHANGE THE PRINT HEADER PAGE IF YOU CARE, OURS WAS
               'MVS'.

 3. SLSS#SP  - ADD A JOBCARD AND JECL CARDS TO THE JCL. CUSTOMIZE THE
               JCL IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SYNCSORT. MAYBE YOU SHOULD SAVE
               THIS FOR LATER WHEN IT ALL MAKES SENSE.

 4. SLSS#SS  - SUBJECT NUMBERS. DECIDE HOW YOU WANT YOUR SUBJECT NO.
               BROKEN UP. USE MINE AS A GUIDE.

 5. SLSS#C   - A. ALLOC A PDS FILE TO TAKE THE PLACE OF MY FILE CALLED
                  '$354JDM.SLSS.TABLES'. MAKE IT 5 TRKS 3350 OR 3380,
                  FB/80/6160 WITH SAY 5 DIR.
               B. CHANGE THE FI(REPORT) TSO ALLOC STATEMENT TO YOUR
                  DSNAME, UNIT, AND VOLSER. THIS IS USED AS FILE TO
                  HOLD THE 'FLAT' FILE SO WHEN WE SPIN OFF THE JCL,
                  THE FILE IS ON DASD AND THEN THE JOB SCRATCHES IT
                  WHEN IT IS DONE.
               C. NOTICE THAT THE DDNAME FOR THE TABLE DSN IS
                  'SLSSTBL'. I DID THIS SO YOU DO NOT HAVE TO WORRY
                  ABOUT CONCATENATION SEQUENCES TO ISPTLIB. A FEW
                  WORDS ABOUT ISPTLIB. WHEN YOU DEAL WITH TABLES
                  YOU MUST HAVE THE TABLE LIBRARY CONCATENATED AS
                  A PART OF ISPTLIB FOR THE READING IN. THIS YOU
                  CANNOT CHANGE (V1 OR V2). NOW WHEN YOU WRITE
                  OUT THE UPDATED TABLE YOU CAN SPECIFY A DDNAME.
                  THUS TO PRECLUDE THE CHANCE OF A USER MESSING UP
                  THE CONCATENATION SEQUENCES I HAVE THE FILE
                  CONCATENATED TO ISPTLIB FOR INPUT PURPOSES AND
                  ALLOCATED TO SLSSTBL FOR WRITING.

 6. SLSSPRT  - INSTALL THE COBOL PGM IN SOME LIBRARY. REMEMBER TO
               UPDATE THE SKELETON MEMBER SLSS#SP WITH A STEPLIB DD
               CARD IF NEED BE.

 7. NOW YOU ARE READY TO INSTALL THE PANELS IN YOUR SYSTEMS PANEL
    LIBRARY OR BETTER YET A NON-IBM LIBRARY IN THE ISPPLIB DDNAME
    CONCATENATION. COPY THE MSG MEMBERS INTO THE ISPMLIB DDNAME
    CONCATENATION. COPY THE SKELETON MEMBERS INTO THE ISPSLIB DDNAME
    CONCATENATION. COPY THE PROC   MEMBER  INTO THE SYSPROC DDNAME
    CONCATENATION. CONCATENATE THE TABLE LIBRARY TO 'ISPTLIB'.
    NOW  HOWEVER YOU HAVE IT SETUP, DO IT.

    NOTE: WITH ISPF/PDF V2 WE HAVE 'LIBDEF' SO YOU CAN USE IT.
          ALSO INSTEAD OF HAVE SEPARATE LIBRARIES FOR PANELS, MSGS,
          ETC. KEEP THEM ALL IN ONE LIBRARY !

 8. NOW PUT THE SELECTION INTO SOME PANEL, OURS IS IN OUR SYSTEMS
    PROGRAMMERS TOOLS MENU. YOUR WILL INVOKING THE A PANEL FOR EXAMPLE

                L,'PANEL(SLSS#P)'

 9. NOW WITH YOU SUBJECT LIST IN HAND, YOU CAN ENTER YOU MASTER LIBRARY
    BY THE 'BRUTE FORCE' METHOD. SOUNDS TERRIBLE, BUT IT TOOK ME 2
    HALF DAYS TO DO AN ENTIRE MVS SOFTWARE LIBRARY. NOT THAT BAD AFTER
    YOU SEE WHAT A EASY TASK IT WAS TO UPDATE THE THING. UPDATING
    THE BOOKS CAN BE USED TO MAKE YOU LOOK VERY BUSY WHEN YOUR BRAIN
    NEEDS A BREAK. PLUS YOU GET 1ST CRACK AT THE EXCESS MANUALS!

    IF YOU GET LOST, CALL ME.
