+ PREVIEW          You may request the RECEIVE command to display the
+                  data at your terminal as it is being restored to
+                  the data set. Please note that when PREVIEW is
+                  specified when receiving a partitioned data set
+                  what you will see is the unloaded dataset before
+                  RECEIVE has invoked IEBCOPY to restore it to its
+                  original format.
+
+ NOPREVIEW        You may request the RECEIVE command not to display
+                  the data on your terminal as it is being received
+                  by specifying the NOPREVIEW keyword.  NOPREVIEW is
+                  the DEFAULT.
+
+ COPY             You may request the RECEIVE command to copy the
+                  file in its transmission format into the named
+                  dataset by spefifying this keyword. You may then
+                  use the RECEIVE INDATASET keyword to restore
+                  the data in its original format at a later time.
