+ USERID           The USERID operand of the RECEIVE command is
+                  the TSO USERID for which files are to be received.
+                  You may specify this operand, however, the RECEIVE
+                  command will verify that you have TSO OPERATOR
+                  command authority before requesting files from
+                  the Job Entry Subsystem. If you do not have TSO
+                  OPERATOR command authority and wish to receive
+                  files for another TSO USERID, your installation
+                  can provide this function through one of the
+                  RECEIVE command installation exits.
+
+ PARM             You may specify a character string to be passed
+                  to your installation's exit routines.  If the
+                  parameter contains blanks or other special
+                  characters, you must enclose the string in quotes.
+                  Normally, you will only supply a parameter string
