+       IDTF will allow TSO users to transmit files to other TSO  users
+   and to receive files from TSO users. IDTF also allows TSO users  to
+   do  file transfers to  VM/CMS  users on other systems.  Along  with
+   file   transfers,  IDTF  permits  a  user to  compose  messages and
+   send them to users on other   systems.  TSO users have long had the
+   capability to SEND  messages to other  TSO  users on the same node.
+   Now  with TSO/E TRANSMIT for messages,  TSO users can send messages
+   or multi-line  messages to TSO  users at the same mode or different
+   nodes.
+
+       IDTF uses the JES2 Spool volume as the  holding  device for the
+   files and messages.  IDTF will take  the file to be transferred and
+   perform  a  compression on the records  when they are placed on the
+   spool.  These files are put out on the spool as CLASS=B punch files
+   with a jobname  of the  sendor and  queued to an IBM Writer name of
+   the userid of the receiver.  Files sent to other systems   are sent
+   over the NJE links to the appropriate system and onto the receiver.
+   The  receiving user  can be automatically  notified of the  arrival
+   of the file.
