+           Complete TSO Help for RECEIVE Command
+
+        The TSO/E Interactive Data Transmission Facility RECEIVE
+        command allows you to obtain files transmitted to your
+        userid.  The RECEIVE command querys the Job Entry Subsystem
+        (JES) on your behalf to determine if there are any files
+        for your TSO userid.  If there is at least one file, the
+        RECEIVE command will obtain the file from JES and then
+        display descriptive information about the file. You will
+        then be prompted for information to control the RECEIVE
+        operation.  You may choose to accept the default dataset
+        name (the origin dataset name with your prefix replacing
+        the sender's userid) and space information by simply
+        pressing the key marked ENTER.  You may also specify
+        overriding parameters as described later on.  After you
+        have successfully received a file, the RECEIVE command
+        will continue processing with any remaining files.
+        If requested by the sender, a notification of receipt, by
+        you, and the success of your RECEIVE command processing
+        will be transmitted back to the sender.
