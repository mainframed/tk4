      This file contains a modified LISTCAT from the U.S. Airforce
      and MURPHY (i'm not sure which file I found it on).  The
      LISTCAT modifications create an INFO/MVS V3 data base file
      for a complete searchable LISTCAT ALL of the system catalogs.
      This data set is an IEBCOPY unloaded partition data set on
      a no label 6250 BPI tape.  *LABEL=(1,NL,EXPDT=98000)*
