         This utility is intended to list Syncsort activity for all
         batch jobs, started tasks, and TSO users on the MVS system
         using the SMF records provided by that product.  It provides
         a flexible selection and sort mechanism to tailor the report.
         The following information can be provided for each selected
         sort process:

         JOBNAME   - The name of the batch job, task, or TSO user.

         JOBTYPE   - The job type T (test) or P (production) for the
                     job.

         STEPNAME  - The name of the step which executed the sort
                     procedure.

         SYSID     - The name of the MVS system which executed the sort
                     process.

         DATE      - The Julian date that the sort began execution.

         TIME      - The time of day that the sort began execution.

         DURATION  - The elapsed wall time for the sort process which
                     was executed.

         CPUTIME   - The CPU time for the sort process which was
                     executed.

         INCORE    - The indicator (Y/N) which indicates whether the
                     sort process was able to complete within the
                     storage available without using SORTWK space.

         TRACKS    - The number of SORTWK tracks allocated.

         RECORDS   - The number of input records sorted.

         BYTES     - The number of bytes (characters) of data which
                     was sorted.

         FACTOR    - The over (O) or under (U) allocation factor for
                     for the SORTWK files.  This only applies if
                     SORTWK files were previously allocated.

         The SYSIN file and any control statements are optional.  If
         neither is present, then all sort processes for all jobs
         are included in the report.  Note that this can be a huge
         report since a large number of sort processes are executed
         It is anticipated that this report will usually be limited
         by specific control statements which will specify which of
         the input records will be included on the report.
         Following is a list of the input control statements.  A
         detailed description of each entry will follow this list.

             Note that each sort option can be suffixed by "(A)" or
             "(D)" for ascending or descending sort sequence.  The
             default is "(A)" for ascending.


             Some of the options have more than one spelling.  Also
             many of the options are allowed to be abbreviated to
             a shorted name as long as it remains unique.  That it,
             as long as another option could not also be abbreviated
             to the same name.

             the specified name starts other than in position 1 of the
             job name.  A name of less than 8 characers is assumed to
             be generic.  That is, any job which starts with the
             specified characters will be selected.

         2)  DATE=yy.ddd:yy.ddd

             after the specified time of day if one time is
             specified or began within the time range if two times

             ALIASES STOPCOUNT/STOPCNT

             This option limits the report to only printing the

             any entries.  This will be the first nnnnn selectable
             type 208 records if the SORT option is not taken or the

                   will be printed.  The totals option is implied
                   by this option.

        Many of the error message refer to errors on optional control
        statements.  The control statement is always written to the
