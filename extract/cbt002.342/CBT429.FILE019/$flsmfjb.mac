         This utility is intended to list job activity at the step or
         job level, depending on execution options, for all batch jobs,
         started tasks, and TSO users on the MVS system.  It provides a
         flexible selection and sort mechanism to tailor the report.
         The following information can be provided for each selected
         job or job step:

         JOBNAME   - The name of the batch job, task, or TSO user.

                     INTERVAL is selected.  This can be displayed
                     in Julian or Gregorian format.

         STIME     - The time of day that the step began execution,
                     when the job began if JOBLEVEL is selected, or

                     when the job ended if JOBLEVEL is selected, or

          a record for each selected job or step will be written to

         The SYSIN file and any control statements are optional.  If
         neither is present, then all steps for all jobs are included
         in the report.  Note that this can be a huge report since, by
         default, every step in every batch job, started task, and TSO
         user will be listed.  It is anticipated that this report will
         usually be limited by specific control statements which will
         specify which of the input records will be included on the
         report.  Following is a list of the input control statements.
         A detailed description of each entry will follow this list.

         Note especially the JOBLEVEL option which specifies that the
         report be generated at the job level rather than at the
         default step level.  Since this is a summary level, some
         of the detailed information is lost.

         Also note the INTERVAL option which specifies that the
         report be generated from the SMF interval records generated
         at the end of each SMF recording interval (usually 30 minutes)
         and at the end of each step.  This allows a means to track
         the resources used by long running jobs or system tasks such
         as CICS, ROSCOE, or ADABAS.  It may be important to track
         these jobs or tasks on a time of day basis.

         An asterisk in front of an option denotes that up to 1000
         of those statements may be entered as selection criteria.

         1)  INTERVAL

             ALIASES *NONE*

             Produce the report at the using the SMF interval
             records rather than the step or job summary records.
             This provides a way to track the system resources by
             time of day for long running tasks or jobs.  Note that
             an interval record is created for all job steps, even
             short ones at end of job to record the resources used
             since the start of job or start of interval..

         2)  JOBLEVEL

             ALIASES *NONE*

             Produce the report at the job level using the job summary
             SMF records rather than the step summary records.  This
             results in a much shorter report but also results in loss
             of detailed information such as step name and program name.
             Some information will be cumulative such as elapsed time
             and CPU time while others will be maximum values depending
             on the field.

             job name.  A name of less than 8 characers is assumed to
             be generic.  That is, any job which starts with the
             specified characters will be selected.

             value can be specified to indicate that the specified
             name starts other than in position 1 of the job name.
             A name of less than 8 characers is assumed to be
