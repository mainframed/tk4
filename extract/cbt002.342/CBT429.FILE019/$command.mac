     This program will execute MVS or JES2 commands within a batch job o
     started task.  The command(s) can be requested from the PARM parame
     on the EXECute card or from an optional parameter file defined by t
     DDname IEFRDER or both the PARM and the file.  If commands are ente
     on both the PARM and the optional IEFRDER file, the commands in the
     PARM are executed first.

     Note that comments can be entered in the command list by starting
     the command entry with a "*".

     The command(s) can be entered by placing the command in the PARM
     parameter on the EXECute statement.  If more than one command is
     desired, separate the commands with a semi-colon.  Remember, MVS on
     allows up to 100 characters in the PARM.

     Commands can also be entered from the optional IEFRDER file.  The
     first 72 characters of each input record is used as the command.
     Command stacking with the semi-colon which is used in the PARM valu
     is NOT allowed.  Each input record represents one command.


                              SPECIAL NOTES

     Most MVS and JES2 commands can be entered.  ALL commands will be
     echoed on the system console and syslog as an audit trail.  This
     PROGRAM IS PROTECTED from unauthorized use.


     Sometimes a delay is desired between two commands.  This is
     accomplished by a special "command" as follows:

          DELAY=nnn        where nnn is the number of seconds to wait

     This will cause the program to wait the specified number of seconds
     before issuing the next command.


     Sometimes a reply to an outstanding message is desired and the mess
     number is not known.  This is accomplished by another special
     "command" as follows:

          REPLY jobname 'message text' 'reply text'

     This will cause the program to create a reply command with the 'rep
     text' if there is an outstanding message for the specified job
     containing the specified 'message text'.  If the compare for the
     'message text' is not desired, code an asterisk.  This will cause t
     reply to be made for any outstanding reply for the specified job.


     Sometimes a command or series of commands depends on the presence
     or absence of another job or started task.  A facility is provided
     by which this utility will wait for a job or task to either start
     or stop.  The format of the two special commands is as follows:

          STARTED jobname         which will wait for the specified job
                                  to start

          STOPPED jobname         which will wait for the specified job
                                  to terminate

     If the job is not STARTED or STOPPED per the command, the program
     will issue a non-rollable message to the operator's console stating
     that it is waiting and will wait for the appropriate event to occur
     Once the appropriate job has STARTED or STOPPED, the message will b
     deleted and processing will continue.

                                    SAMPLE JCL

          //jobname  JOB ...
          //STEP1    EXEC PGM=COMMAND,PARM='command1;command2;command3'
          //IEFRDER  DD  *
          command4
          command5

     Again, the commands can come from either or both of the PARM or the
     optional IEFRDER file.  If only one or two commands are required, t
     PARM can be used and the IEFRDER DD statement completely eliminated

         1)  CMD001E ILLEGAL VALUE SPECIFIED ON THE DELAY CONTROL
                     STATEMENT - JOB ABORTED
             ABEND   USER 0001

             The DELAY=nnn "command" was encountered and the nnn value
             which specifies the number of seconds to wait was either
             not numeric or exceeded a maximum value of 999 seconds.


         2)  CMD002I jobname1 WAITING FOR jobname2 TO COMPLETE

             The STOPPED jobname2 "command" was encountered.  The
             specified jobname is still executing.  The program will
             wait for it to complete.  At that time, this message will
             be deleted and processing resumed.

             The jobname1 value is the name of the task or job which is
             using the COMMAND facility.  The jobname2 value is the
             job or task which was specified on the STOPPED statement.

         3)  CMD003I jobname1 WAITING FOR jobname2 TO START

             The STARTED jobname2 "command" was encountered.  The
             specified jobname is not executing.  The program will
             wait for it to start.  At that time, this message will
             be deleted and processing resumed.

             The jobname1 value is the name of the task or job which is
             using the COMMAND facility.  The jobname2 value is the
             job or task which was specified on the STARTED statement.

         4)  command text                          error msg

             Each command text is "echoed" on the console to provide
             an audit trail.   If the command is a REPLY "command",
             there are four possible error numbers which can be added
             to the end of the message text.  They are as follows:

             ERROR01 - More than 3 parameters where specified on the
                       REPLY statement.

             ERROR02 - A null jobname was specified on the REPLY
                       statement.

             ERROR03 - A jobname which is longer than eight characters
                       was specified on the REPLY statement.

             ERROR04 - The specified jobname on the REPLY statement was
                       either not executing or had no outstanding reply
                       message.
