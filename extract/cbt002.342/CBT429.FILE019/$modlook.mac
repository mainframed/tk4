         This program is designed to run as a TSO command, started
         task or a batch job to look up the selected module(s) in the
         system link list or link pack area.  If the module is in the
         link list, the link list library name will be displayed.  If
         the module is in the link pack area, its address will be
         displayed along with the name of the resident area in which it
         is located such as PLPA, FLPA, ECSA, etc.  The first part of
         each module is displayed also since it can contain date,
         time, or copyright information which may be of interest.


         When the program is run from TSO, the user will be prompted
         for a module name and the response will be displayed on the
         TSO user terminal.  When it is run as a started task, a WTOR
         request will be made for the module name and the response
         will be sent to the console.  If it is run as a batch job,
         the module name will be entered as the first 8 characters of
         a record read from the sysin file and the response will be
         written to the SYSPRINT file.

         The program will continue to ask for other module names until
         end-of-file is reached on the SYSIN file for a batch job or a
         'STOP', 'END', or '/*' is received from a TSO user or the
         operator console.
