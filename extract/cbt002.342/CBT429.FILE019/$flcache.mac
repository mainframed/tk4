         This utility is intended for use by Technical Support or
         senior computer operators.  Use by unauthorized personnel
         will result in security violations.

         This program is designed to allow the operator to display or
         modify the 3990-3 Cache subsystem from the MVS operator's
         console.  The only provided means of control for the cache
         subsystem is executing  the IBM IDCAMS utility as a batch job
         and then looking at the output to determine the results.
         This FLCACHE program will accept 'simple' commands from the
         console and generate the appropriate IDCAMS statement and
         call IDCAMS interactively to actually perform the function.
         All messages from IDCAMS will be displayed on the operator's
         console.

         When any device on the 3990 cache subsystem must be altered,
         it is often because of a hardware problem when prompt action
         must be taken.  The IBM publication which describes these
         special commands is not always easy to locate or understand.
         Hopefully, this program will make these functions easy to
         perform when required.  As always, Technical Support should
         be involved any time this facility is used to alter the
         status of the subsystem.

                           STARTING FLCACHE

         FLCACHE is set up to run as a started task.  It can be
         started with the following command from the console:

         S FLCACHE

         An outstanding reply message will be issued to the operators
         console asking for commands.




                           FLCACHE COMMANDS


        All commands listed below are issued in response to the
        FLIDC000I ENTER FLCACHE COMMAND outstanding message on the
        operators console or a MODIFY command to the task or job.  The
        operator will be prompted for another command after completion
        of each command.



         LIST  PINNED  { VOL(vvvvvv) × UNIT(uuu) }

         List information about any data on any volume which cannot be
         written from cache to the actual dasd device because of
         errors on a device.  The VOL or UNIT operand can be used to
         designate which cache subsystem is to be listed or omitted if
         only one 3990 subsystem exists.  The UNIT operand, if
         entered,  must specify an online device


         LIST  SUBSYS  { VOL(vvvvvv) × UNIT(uuu) }

         List information about the status of any 3990 subsystem.
         The VOL or UNIT operand can be used to designate which cache
         subsystem is to be listed or omitted if only one 3990
         subsystem exists.


         LIST  DEVICES  { VOL(vvvvvv) × UNIT(uuu) }

         List information about the status of all devices within a
         3990 subsystem.  The VOL or UNIT operand can be used to
         designate which cache subsystem is to be listed or omitted
         if only one 3990 subsystem exists.


         LIST  VOL(vvvvvv) × UNIT(uuu)

         List information about the status of a single device within
         the 3990 subsystem.  The UNIT operand, if entered, must
         specify an online device.


         CACHE  SUBSYS  ON × OFF  { VOL(vvvvvv) × UNIT(uuu) }

         Turn on or off the caching facilities of the 3990 subsystem.
         Turning the subsystem OFF stops ALL caching functions for all
         volumes on that subsystem.  Turning the subsystem ON only
         enables cache read or Dasd Fast Write to function.  The cache
         read and Dasd Fast Write settings for each volume determines
         whether those facilities are active.  The VOL or UNIT operand
         can be used to designate which cache subsystem is to be
         processed  or omitted if only one 3990 subsystem exists.  The
         UNIT operand, if entered, must specify on online device if
         the ON operand is also specified.

         CACHE  ON × OFF   VOL(vvvvvv) × UNIT(uuu)

         Turn on or off the cache read facility for a selected volume
         in the 3990 subsystem.  The subsystem cache facility must
         also be on for cache read to function.  The VOL or UNIT
         operand must be used to designate which volume is to be
         processed.  The UNIT operand must be used if the device is
         offline.


         NVS  ON × OFF   VOL(vvvvvv) × UNIT(uuu)

         Turn on or off the use of Non-Volatile Storage in the 3990
         subsystem.  NVS must be on for Dasd Fast Write to function.
         Turning off NVS will disable Dasd Fast Write for all volumes
         in the subsystem.  The Dasd Fast Write facility must also be
         turned on for each volume in the subsystem for which that
         facility is desired.  The VOL or UNIT operand can be used to
         designate which cache subsystem is to be processed  or
         omitted if only one 3990 subsystem exists.  The UNIT operand,
         if entered, must specify an online device if the ON operand
         is also specified.


         DFW  ON × OFF   VOL(vvvvvv) × UNIT(uuu)

         Turn on or off the Dasd Fast Write facilities of a selected
         volume in the 3990 subsystem.  The normal cache read facility
         is not affected by this command.  For Dasd Fast Write to
         function, both the cache facility and Non-Volatile Storage
         must be turned on for the subsystem and both cache read and
         Dasd Fast Write must be turned on for the device.  If any one
         of these facilities is not turned on, Dasd Fast Write will
         not function.  The VOL or UNIT operand must be used to
         designate which volume is to be processed.  The UNIT operand,
         if entered, must specify an online device if the ON operand
         is also specified.

         CFW  ON × OFF   VOL(vvvvvv) × UNIT(uuu)

         Turn on or off the Cache Fast Write facility of the 3990
         subsystem.  The cache facility must also be on for the
         subsystem for this facility to function.  The VOL or UNIT
         operand can be used to designate which cache subsystem is to
         be processed  or omitted if only one 3990 subsystem exists.
         The UNIT operand, if entered, must specify an online device.


         END / STOP / CLOSE / QUIT / SHUTDOWN

         Terminate processing.
