         This program is designed to run immediately after an IPL to
         check the size of the private area below the 16 meg line.
         Software maintenance or implementation of new products may
         shift the private area size down an extra meg in ESA.  The
         parm value entered specifies the minimum size of the private
         area in 'K' units that is expected.  If the area is smaller
         than this value, a non-roll deletable message will be written
         to the system console.

         1)  FLPVT001E - BAD PARM ON EXEC STATEMENT - JOB ABORTED

             The parm must contain a numeric value giving the minimum
             size of the private area in 'K' units.


         2)  FLPVT002W PRIVATE AREA IS TOO SMALL - NOTIFY TSD
             IMMEDIATELY

             The private area size is smaller than the size specified
             in the PARM statement.  This non-roll deletable message
             will be issued to warn of potential problems.


         3)  FLPVT003I PRIVATE AREA SIZE IS LARGE ENOUGH - CONTINUE
             PROCESSING

             This informational message states that the private area
             size is greater than or equal to the value specified in
             in the PARM statement.
