         This program will search each individual member of a
         partitioned data set for specified block sizes.  if one is
         found, the JOBNAME, STEPNAME, PROGRAM NAME, DDNAME and
         BLOCKSIZE will be listed.  It does not handle cataloged
         procedures or INCLUDE statements.  The report can be used to
         detect improperly specified block sizes.


                               JCL

        //JOBNAME  JOB ....
        //BLKSCAN  EXEC PGM=BLKSCAN,REGION=4M
        //SYSLIB   DD  DSN=PDS.JCL.LIBRARY,DISP=SHR

         1)  BSCN001E OPEN FOR SYSPRINT DATA SET FAILED
             ABEND   USER 0001

             A SYSPRINT DD statement is required to define the output
             report file.


         2)  BSCN002E OPEN FOR SYSLIB DATA SET FAILED
             ABEND   USER 0002

             A SYSLIB DD statement is required to define the input
             dataset containing JCL members.


         3)  BSCN003E TOO MANY MEMBERS IN SYSLIB FILE
             ABEND   USER 0003

             The number of members of the input SYSLIB data set
             exceeded 8,188.


         4)  BSCN004E NO MEMBERS IN THE SYSLIB FILE
             ABEND   USER 0004

             The input SYSLIB data set was empty.


         5)  BSCN005E ACTUAL BLOCKSIZE NOT A MULTIPLE OF LRECL
             ABEND   USER 0005

             The input block length was not a multiple of 80.


         6)  BSCN006E LENGTH OF BLOCK READ WAS ZERO
             ABEND   USER 0006

             This is an internal error The input block length was
             zero, which should be impossible.


         7)  BSCN007W UNKNOWN STATEMENT TYPE - BYPASSED
             Warning message only

             A statement type other than JOB, PROC, EXEC, DD,
             PEND, or OUTPUT was encountered.  Updates will
             be required for INCLUDE, JCLLIB, IF, ELSE, and
             ENDIF statements so that they will be ingnored.
