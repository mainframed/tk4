* THIS FILE CONTAINS TWO EXITS THAT ARE USED TO CONTROL VIO ALLOCATION
* SIZE, FORCE TSO TEMPORARY DATA SETS TO DEDICATED TSO "PUBLIC" VOLUMES,
* AND A FEW OTHER MISCELLANEOUS FUNCTIONS.  THESE EXITS ARE FOR MVS/XA
* AND HAVE BEEN RUN UNDER MVS/SP2.1.2, MVS/SP2.1.3, AND MVS/SP2.1.7
* FOR A TOTAL OF ABOUT THREE YEARS.                           12/23/87

*THE EXITS ARE:
*
*IEFDB401:
*  SVC99 EXIT TO ALLOCATE TSO TEMPORARY DATASETS TO A TSO ONLY SCRATCH
*  PACK AND CONTROL THE SIZE OF VIO DATA SETS FROM TSO.  THIS EXIT
*  CHANGES THE UNIT NAME FOR ALL DYNAMIC ALLOCATIONS TO SUPPORT THE
*  FOLLOWING FUNCTIONS:
*     1) CONTROL VIO ALLOCATION SIZE.  THIS REQUIRES THE USER TO
*         SPECIFY UNIT(VIOALLOC).  UNIT=VIOALLOC IS NOT VALID IN THE
*         SYSGEN PARAMETERS.  IF THE SPACE= SPECIFIES A VALID AMOUNT
*         OF DISK SPACE, THE UNIT= IS CHANGED TO UNIT=VIODA WHICH IS
*         A 3340.  IF UNIT=VIODA IS CODED IN THE JCL OR THE SPACE= IS
*         TOO LARGE, THE UNIT= IS CHANGED TO UNIT=SYSDA.
*     2) FORCE TSO TEMPORARY DATASETS TO A DEDICATED "PUBLIC" VOLUME.
*         UNIT(VIOALLOC) IS SPECIFIED TO INVOKE THIS SERVICE.  IF THE
*         SPACE= IS MET IN 1) ABOVE, THE DATASET GOES TO VIO; OTHERWISE
*         A CHECK IS MADE TO VERIFY THAT THE DYNAMIC ALLOCATION IS MADE
*         BY A TSO USER.  IF IT IS A TSO USER, UNIT=TSODA IS USED TO
*         FORCE TSO DATASETS TO DEDICATED TSO "PUBLIC" VOLUMES.  ANY
*         ATTEMPT TO CODE UNIT(TSODA) IS REPLACED BY UNIT(SYSDA).
*     3) VERIFY THAT ALL IMS ALLOCATION OF AN INTERNAL READER COMES
*         FROM PROGRAM O9061S75.  THIS IS TO ENSURE THAT ACF2 HAS THE
*         CORRECT SYSTEM ID FOR JOBS SUBMITTED BY IMS TRANSACTIONS.  AN
*         ATTEMPT TO VIOLATE ACF2 REQUIREMENTS GETS THE USER A S0C3.
*     4) UNIT=DISK IS SUBSTITUTED FOR ALL UNIT=XXXX WHERE XXXX IS
*         EXACTLY FOUR CHARACTERS LONG.
*
*
*IEFUJV:
*  SMF EXIT TO CHANGE JCL TO MEET COMPANY STANDARDS.  IT SUPPORTS THE
*  MSVGP= PARAMETER FOR A NON-3850 ENVIRONMENT, CONTROLS VIO SPACE
*  ALLOCATION AND SEVERAL OTHER MISCELLANEOUS FUNCTIONS.  SUPPORTS THE
*  FOLLOWING FUNCTIONS:
*
*   I. JOB CARD -- NO ACTION
*
*  II. EXEC CARD
*     1) WRITE AN SMF TYPE 131 RECORD IF A PROC IS EXECUTED.  THIS IS
*         TO ALLOW DETERMINATION WHICH PROCS ARE USED AND WHICH ARE NOT
*
* III. DD CARD
*     1) CONTROL VIO ALLOCATION SIZE.  THIS REQUIRES THE USER TO
*         SPECIFY UNIT=VIOALLOC.  UNIT=VIOALLOC IS NOT VALID IN THE
*         SYSGEN PARAMETERS.  IF THE SPACE= SPECIFIES A VALID AMOUNT
*         OF DISK SPACE, THE UNIT= IS CHANGED TO UNIT=VIODA WHICH IS
*         A 3340.  IF UNIT=VIODA IS CODED IN THE JCL OR THE SPACE= IS
*         TOO LARGE, THE UNIT= IS CHANGED TO UNIT=SYSDA.  THIS JOB HAS
*         THE NAME OF TWO BATCH JOBS THAT ARE ALLOWED TO USE VIO,
*         OTHERWISE VIO IS RESTRICTED TO TSO USERS ONLY.  BOTH UNIT=
*         AND SPACE= MUST BE ON THE SAME CARD FOR THIS TO WORK.  UNIT=
*         MUST ALSO BE THE LAST PARAMETER ON THE LAST CARD OF A DD
*         CARD CONCATENATION.
*     2) FORCE TSO TEMPORARY DATASETS TO A DEDICATED "PUBLIC" VOLUME.
*         UNIT=VIOALLOC IS SPECIFIED TO INVOKE THIS SERVICE.  IF THE
*         SPACE= IS MET IN 1) ABOVE, THE DATASET GOES TO VIO; OTHERWISE
*         A CHECK IS MADE TO VERIFY THAT THE DYNAMIC ALLOCATION IS MADE
*         BY A TSO USER.  IF IT IS A TSO USER, UNIT=TSODA IS USED TO
*         FORCE TSO DATASETS TO DEDICATED TSO "PUBLIC" VOLUMES.  ANY
*         ATTEMPT TO CODE UNIT(TSODA) IS REPLACED BY UNIT(SYSDA).  BOTH
*         UNIT= AND SPACE= MUST BE ON THE SAME CARD FOR THIS TO WORK.
*     3) MSVGP=GDGDAn IS OUR INSTALLATION SPECIFICATION FOR DISK GDG
*         DATASETS (CURRENTLY 2 3380-BE4 UNITS WORTH).  THE CODE TO
*         IMPLEMENT THIS IS IN THIS EXIT.  MSVGP= MUST BE THE ONLY
*         USEFUL INFORMATION ON THE LAST CARD OF A DD CARD CONTINUATION
*         FOR THIS TO WORK BECAUSE THE ENTIRE CARD IS REPLACED.
*     4) THE ARCHAIC FORM OF THE INTERNAL READER IS CHANGED TO THE
*         CURRENTLY SUPPORTED VERSION.
