*   (2)  This program may be distributed via "public domain" mods     *
*        tapes, such as the SHARE mods tape, the CBT (Connecticut     *

*        tapes.  Distribution of modified versions of this program,   *
*        via the above named tapes or via any method, is              *
*        specifically prohibited.  (Please see reason mentioned       *
*        below.)                                                      *

*        only at the site making the mods.  (Please see reason        *
*        mentioned below.)                                            *

*                                                                     *
*   (5)  The only charge for running the program which may be made    *
*        is your normal charge for computer time.                     *
*                                                                     *

*   The reason for the restrictions on distribution of modified       *
*   versions is to try to prevent circulation of many different       *
*   versions of the program, each with a few features that aren't     *
*   in any other version.                                             *
*                                                                     *
*   Since everyone will benefit from this, please send all updates    *
*   to me.  (Address below.)  I will try merge them in, if they       *
*   have been made to a reasonably current version of the source,     *
*   and if they are in keeping with the general design of the rest    *
*   of the program.  Mods may be altered by me for this purpose.      *
*   Any such mods which are incorporated into the program will then   *
*   become governed by the restrictions specified here for the whole  *
*   program, with appropriate credit to the contributor.              *
*                                                                     *
*   Although this program has been extensively tested, and is in use  *
*   in a production environment (MVS/ESA release 3.1.3, w/DFP 3.2),   *
*   no guarantee is made of (or responsibility assumed for) correct   *
*   or reliable operation.  I may try to help with problems.  I do    *
*   not assume any responsibility to distribute updates.              *
