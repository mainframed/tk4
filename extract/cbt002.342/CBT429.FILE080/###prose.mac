This dataset contains the source code for six programs, all of which
extract data from the RACF dataset(s) and format it into output files
suitable for use with report writers (such as DYL280, etc.) or input to
user written programs.

Each of these programs processes a different kind of RACF profile. The
profile type processed is indicated in the program name; i.e., RACFUSER
processes USER profiles, RACFDSET processes DATASET profiles, RACFGRES
processes GENERAL RESOURCE profiles, and RACFGRP1 and RACFGRP2 process
GROUP profiles. GENERICS is a program which returns the protecting
GENERIC dataset profile for any input dataset names.

Each of the programs has been coded without much DCB information (except
for LRECL) specified to allow flexibility in the end user environment.

Each of the programs has been written, debugged, tested, and implemented
into production in a MVS/XA, Assembler-H verion 2, and RACF 1.7 shop,
but the author can see no reason why these jobs shouldn't be fully
usable in other environments with few or no changes whatsoever.

Also included are several sets of sample JCL to use the programs to
produce simple SYSOUT datasets, but this is far from the best use for
these programs. They are particularly useful when the output from them
is combined, as in the example contained in member SAMPLE of this
dataset. This example (for those not fortunate enough to have SAS and/or
DYL280 in their shops) takes the output from RACFUSER and RACFGRES (as
run against IMS transactions), merges them by user-ID, and prints a
report of IMS transaction authorizations sorted by user name. Nifty, eh?

The GENERICS program is characterized by an unusual input format (where
the dataset name is placed in columns 19-63 and the volume of residence
for the dataset is in columns 13-18) to accomodate the raw output of the
DMS/OS SVD report program as input to the program. An example of using
GENERICS in conjunction with DMS/OS for input and DYL-280 for output is
presented in member JCLGNRC2, and an example of using GENERICS alone is
presented in member JCLGNRC1.
