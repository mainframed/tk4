    General Product Summaries for MacKinney Systems Products
    ------- ------- --------- --- --------- ------- --------

CICS/Autoinstall - Assign specific terminal ids and printer ids
while still getting advantages of IBM's autoinstall facility.
Current netname/termid relationships can be saved so you can convert
to autoinstall without changing users' termids.

CICS/CEMT from Batch - Allows CICS CEMT SET commands to be submitted
from batch job streams. OPEN, CLOSE, ALLOCATE, UNALLOCATE CICS
files, ENABLE or DISABLE transactions, and acquire resources.
Continue CICS inquiries while a batch update runs, then change the
file back to update mode in CICS when the batch job is done.

CICS/Fax - Allows users to key and send faxes from any CICS terminal
using a simple editor. Also faxes portions of batch reports. CICS
programs can also generate faxes. Multiple line capability available
(additional charge).

CICS/Forward Recovery System - Forward Recovery System using CICS
Journals. Reapply all updates processed by CICS to rebuild a lost or
corrupted VSAM file.

CICS/JSUB - Submits batch JCL from a CICS application program.
Build JCL within the working storage of your CICS program and link
to JSUB passing the JCL in the COMMAREA or Temp Storage.

CICS/Log View - Display CICS System logs (CSMT, etc.) on-line.
Search for character strings.  Be notified when certain entries are
logged.

CICS/Hotprint - Invoke screen print by pressing PA or PF key. User
profile controls printer selection, headers, form feed before/after,
etc. Optionally prompt user for printer-id.

CICS/MAPR II - Includes a screen painting facility, a prototyping
facility, full length data names for COBOL DSECTS, group-level
occurs for repeated rows, and a COPY facility which allows users to
build a new map using an existing map as a base.  All screen
development is done interactively under CICS. BMS macros are
created.

CICS/Menu II - CICS/Menu II presents a consistent point of entry and
prevents users from seeing a blank screen. Menus may be nested and
an optional user exit allows pre-display customizing.

CICS/Message - Messages can be sent from an application program or a
terminal. After reading the message, CLEAR refreshes the full screen
and COMMAREA. Messages can be sent to 'ALL' CICS terminals or lists
of terminals/operators/users/netnames.

CICS/Morning News - Displays one or more screens of news to each
user when they log on or sign on to CICS. Each news item may be
limited to certain users or lists of users by terminal-id,
operator-id, user-id, or netname. News may be entered to display on
a future date as a reminder.

CICS/On Line File Utility - Allows programmers to instantly view any
record of any file defined to CICS. The record is displayed in
character and hexadecimal and may be updated or deleted. New records
may be added and files may be browsed forward or backward. A file
can be scanned for a character string.

CICS/Qsort -  Incorporate sorting in your CICS programs.  Sorts a
Temp Storage Queue by up to 10 fields. Queue records may be up to
999 bytes, and you may sort queues of up to several thousand items
without hurting response time for other transactions.

CICS/Response Time Monitor - Tracks response time for each
transaction. Display transactions based on response time, opid,
termid, tranid, time of day. Flexible batch reporting for analysis.

CICS/SignOn - A CICS security package providing security for CICS
transactions, terminals, and users.  It also provides complete
signon/signoff functions for CICS users.

CICS/Spooler - CICS terminal printer spooling system simplifies
programming and improves throughput. Allows either batch or online
programs to spool reports into the CICS/Spooler queue. The reports
may be sent to a batch system printer, and may be viewed from a CRT
before printing.

CICS/Spy - Simultaneously view screens that are sent to another CICS
terminal or collect all screens sent to a terminal in a VSAM file
for future display. Collects both input and output screens.

CICS/Swap - A CICS transaction which allows up to eight CICS
transactions to be active at the same terminal. With the touch of an
installation defined PF or PA key, the terminal operator can swap
from one transaction to the other.

CICS/Timeout - Automatically signs off and/or logs off inactive
terminals, including those running conversational tasks, after a
specified period of inactivity. Length of inactivity specified by
Termid or netname. Exclusion by userid, tranid or operid.

Cobol Glossary - Reads COBOL source libraries and produces system
wide cross-reference lists for data names, file names, copybooks,
CICS commands, DLI commands and more. Finds CICS programs which use
illegal COBOL verbs.

DP Manager - Keeps track of software inventory, hardware inventory,
outstanding problems, changes, etc. to help manage the DP function.
Includes a flexible report generator. Runs under CICS.

Easy Help for CICS - Create 'HELP' windows for pseudo-conversational
programs without programming. Entry of  'HELP' text can be done by
users.

Electro Mail - CICS electronic mail with many features like:
immediate notification when you receive mail, registered mail,
reply, help screens, menus (easy for novice users to learn), etc.

File-Compare - Compares two files showing records that were added,
changed, or deleted. Handles VSAM or sequential files. Highlights
the changed data. Useful for checking test results and investigating
problems.

FileMarvel (MVS only) - A full function ISPF tool for manipulating
VSAM, sequential, and PDS datasets. Four edit and browse formats
include full screen, copycode, compressed copycode, and dump.
Supports COBOL and PL/1 copybooks. Provides ability to edit/browse a
subset of a dataset based on multiple criteria connected by AND/OR
logic.

Global Search & Replace - MVS version scans PDS or Sequential files.
VSE version scans sequential files, VSE libraries, or ICCF
libraries. Searches for  character strings and optionally replaces
them with new character strings.

ISPF/VSAM Utility (MVS only) - ISPF based, menu driven utility which
provides online access to the most regularly used VSAM functions:
define, delete, inquire, copy, rename, edit, and browse.

JCLXREF (VSE only) - A documentation generator which uses DOS-VSE
JCL as input and produces up to 19 cross reference lists to aid in
trouble shooting, conversions, maintenance, auditing, etc.

JCOPY (VSE only) - A utility language for copying files, one-time
jobs, and simple programs. Includes routines for accessing POWER
queues, Source Statement Library, ICCF, DLI databases, etc.

JES Queue Client for CICS (MVS only) - JQC is a JES2 spool
view/print/control product providing access to the JES2 held, input
and output queues for viewing and controlling jobs and their output.
It gives users access to the JES2 spool queue from CICS without
requiring TSO access.

JES Queue Client for Printers (MVS only) - JQP is a VTAM based
application that will print any report from the JES2 output queue to
printers defined to VTAM. Printer types supported are SNA, NON-SNA
and SCS. Reports in the JES2 output queue are automatically selected
based on their DESTID and printed to the printer defined for that
destination.

JSF-Job and Syslog Facility (MVS only) - Archives SYSLOG, JCL and/or
SYSOUT. Scans for abends and condition codes. Saves paper, time, and
space while improving quality and reliability. Uses ISPF panels.

Kwik-Key/Kwik-Load - Loads base cluster and builds multiple
alternate indexes at the same time. Reduces CPU time, EXCPs, and
elapsed time to reorg VSAM datasets and rebuild AIX.

Listcat Plus - A replacement for the listcat function of IDCAMS.
Listcat Plus prints two reports from the VSAM catalog: a Dataset
Report and a Volume summary. Datasets requiring attention are
flagged based on user specified criteria. Volume of printout is
reduced 95% by using Listcat Plus instead of IDCAMS.

Macro Level Interpreter - Allows running macro-level code in CICS
ESA and CICS TS environments without any coding changes. Also
supports command level applications using the restricted 'EXEC CICS
ADDRESS CSA' command in CICS/ESA 3.x and up.

31-bit / Above the Line - The 31-bit/Above the Line product allows
CICS Assembler programs not using the Facility Control Indicator
(FCI) and all CICS VS/COBOL programs to run above the 16 megabyte
line.

OSXREFS (MVS only) - Consists of four handy cross-reference
generators.

Power Queue Client for Printers (VSE only) - PQP is a VTAM based
application which will print any report from the VSE/POWER LST queue
to network attached printers defined to VTAM.  Printer types
supported are SNA, NON-SNA and SCS.

Show and Tell II - Show what is currently on another user's screen.
Great for helping users without having to go to their  office. Tell
will echo your screen to other screens. Tell can be used for
demonstrations and training sessions (local or remote).

Source Program Compare - Compares two versions of a program and
prints a listing showing all of the differences.

Track - CICS interactive Debugger for COBOL, ALC, and PL1. Stop at
any line, display/update fields, intercept abends, etc. Test faster,
more thoroughly, with fewer compiles.

VTAM Virtual Printer (VVP) - VVP lets you route output created by
your online applications to the system spool. It captures the 3270
based datastream sent to the VTAM printer from any VTAM application
(CICS, IMS, etc.) and creates a report in the JES queue for MVS or
VSE/POWER queue for VSE.

VTAM/Switch - Allows users to switch from CICS to TSO, etc. without
logging on and off. You may also have multiple sessions in the same
VTAM application (ICCF, TSO, IMS, CICS, etc.).

Xray - Interactive debugging for batch programs similar to Track.
Debug your batch programs from a CICS terminal.
