//***FILE 051 is an Internet Surfing file, which contains some      *
//*           URL addresses for MVS-related sites on the Internet.  *
//*           This file is intended to make looking for tools a     *
//*           little easier.  Sometimes, a good tool is available   *
//*           on the Internet, but for some reason, it isn't a      *
//*           good candidate to put on the CBT Tapes themselves.    *
//*           This file is therefore intended as a pointer, to      *
//*           help you get these materials yourself.                *
//*                                                                 *
//*           File 051 lists commercial (or pay, or vendor-         *
//*           supported software), downloadable or listed at        *
//*           Internet sites.                                       *

//*           No responsibility is assumed by anybody connected     *

//*           provided, just so that people can find out about      *
//*           those materials, to determine if they are useful      *
//*           to them.  We do not guarantee in any way, that any    *

//*           Actually, the purpose for creating this file, is to   *
//*           let people know about materials that are specifically *
//*           NOT on the CBT Tape in the form that they are in.     *
//*           Either they belong to somebody, or are copyrighted by *
//*           somebody, but the bottom line is that somebody else   *
//*           controls them.  It is understood that there is no     *
//*           implied or explicit responsibility assumed by any     *
//*           individual or corporate entity having to do with the  *
//*           CBT Tape materials in any way, concerning anything    *
//*           obtained at these sites, in the past or in the        *
//*           future.  Use all of these materials at your own       *
//*           risk, or don't use them at all.                       *
