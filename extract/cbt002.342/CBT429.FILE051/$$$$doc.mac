Welcome to the Internet Surf File (File 051).

      This file contains only pointers to Internet-based web
sites.  See member @FILE051 for index information.

      This file points to commercial software vendor Internet
sites.  Usefulness to systems programmers is considered the main
requisite for sites included here.  Also mentioned are sites that
are not generally known in the U.S., although they may be very
well known in, say, Australia.  They could help U.S. sysprogs
very much.

      This file was inspired by Dave Cartwright, who at one point,
started emailing me lists of MVS web sites to check out.  We decided
to start a CBT Tape file that points users to some of them.  Often,
the proprietors of the stuff can't (practically speaking) import
their things to the CBT Tape directly.  Sometimes they update their
things very often, not in coincidence with when the CBT Tape gets
updated.  And also, sometimes the stuff can't be easily put into
the CBT Tape partitioned dataset format, such as a free UNIX based
C compiler I recently discovered.  So, we'll point you to them,
and you can grab 'em for youselves, if you want them.

      Anyone can feel free to inform me about a useful MVS site.
I'll be the proprietor of this file, but if you have any useful
updates, just send them to me via email and I'll merge them in.
If you can put the info into my (standard?) format, then please do
so.  Otherwise, I'll do it myself.

      Thanks in advance.
