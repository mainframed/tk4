)F FUNCTION
  The BLKSPTRK command calculates direct access storage device track
  capacities. For a given list of device types, this command will
  display exactly how many blocks of a given size (with or without
  keys) will fit on each track.

)X SYNTAX
             BLKSPTRK (devtype devtype ...)
                      BLKSIZE(<size or #count> <size or #count> ...)
                      KEYLEN(length length ...)
  alias    - BPT
  default  - BLKSPTRK BLKSIZE(#1) KEYLEN(0)
  required - at least one devtype

)O OPERANDS
))devtype -
         This operand is required. It must be a direct access storage
         device type. (e.g. 3330, 2305-2, etc.). If more than one device
         type is given, then the list must be enclosed within
         parentheses. Currently, the following device types are
         recognized:
               2301 2302 2305-1 2305-2 2311 2314 2319 2321 3330
               3330-1 MSS-3330 MSS-3330-1 3340-1 3340-2 3350 3375
               3380

))BLKSIZE -
         This operand is optional. If omitted, then B(#1) is used. If
         given, then it may specify one or more physical block sizes
         and/or block counts.

         A block size is given as a plain number (e.g., B(6160)). A
         block count is given preceded by a pound sign (e.g., B(#5)).
         When a block count is given, BLKSPTRK will display the size of
         the largest block that will fit the given number of times on a
         track.

         Giving a zero value is equivalent to giving #1.

))KEYLEN -
         This operand is optional. If omitted, then a zero value is
         used. if given, then it may specify one or more key lengths to
         be used in the track capacity calculations.
