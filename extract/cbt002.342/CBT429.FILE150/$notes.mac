_ Dialog Improvements

  _ Please critique this dialog and phone me with your comments!

  _ Change next version to skip the "DATA" screen when MSG specified

_ Note the driving clist for this dialog utilizes the clist trapping
  capability to enable improved dynamic message notification (i.e. the
  targeted user(s) are notified immeidately of any data transmitted to
  them, instead of waiting until the next RECEIVE command).  While this
  technique makes the use of TRANSMIT more user friendly, it can also
  cause a lock-up of the TRANSMIT command during instances where a
  user response is needed because the trap "hides" this from the user.
  (%XMT DEBUG(DEBUG) ERRCHK(YES) exposes ("debugs") these conditions).
  Anyone with an alternative to this problem, please share!

  _ Re-consider messages generated during XMIT (i.e., quantity)

  _ Implement JES exit for cross-domain event notification

  _ Map RACF ID's/NAMES into a nickname model

  _ Respond to TSO/E User's Guide Readers Comment Form mailed on 8/3/89
    _ TSO/E could use some IDTF-specific variables.
    _ Need access to NAMES.TEXT via clists
    _ IBM needs their own ISPF interface for IDTF
    _ IDTF needs live notification of XMIT cross-domain via JES exit
    _ IDTF has potential for excellent TSO "E-MAIL"!
    _ LOG.MISC needs refined (dsorg=ps "wrap-around" when full?)

_ Re-write Newsletter section (Emphasize E-MAIL capabilities)
