* DOC  : MASTER INDEX TO THE "AUTOMATED IDTF" (ISPF) DIALOG.
*      : MARK DIEHL - HERCULES/ALLEGANY BALLISTICS LAB 304-726-5140/5343
*
*      : THIS MEMBER CONTAINS INSTALLATION GUIDELINES.
*        ALL DIALOG COMPONENTS ARE CONTAINED IN THE PDS WHICH YOU ARE
*        CURRENTLY ACCESSING.  TO STORE EACH COMPONENT IN IT'S PROPER
*        PRODUCTION LIBRARY, SIMPLY REPLACE THE FIRST CHARACTER OF EACH
*        MEMBER NAME WITH AN 'X' DURING COPY OPERATION. THIS WILL EFFECT
*        A MEMBER NAME THAT IS PREFIXED 'XMT' FOR EACH MEMBER THAT IS
*        "FARMED OUT" INTO IT'S APPROPRIATE PRODUCTION LIBRARY TYPE.
*        FOR EXAMPLE, MEMBER CMT INDICATES, BY VIRTUE OF THE FIRST
*        CHARACTER BEING "C" (AKA "CLIST"), THAT IT SHOULD BE STORED
*        INTO A SYSPROC LIBRARY TYPE AS MEMBER NAME XMT.  THIS
*        TECHNIQUE IS USED SO AS TO ALLOW A CONSISTENT  3 CHARACTER
*        "APPLID" ("XMT") ACROSS ALL ISPF/PDF LIBRARIES AS WELL AS
*        ALLOWING THE STORAGE OF ALL APPLICATION COMPONENTS INTO ONE
*        COMMON (NON-PRODUCTION) PDS.  THIS TECHNIQUE PERMITS THE
*        "INSTANT" INSTALL OF THE APPLICATION WITHOUT HAVING TO MAKE ANY
*        CHANGES TO THE ACTUAL MEMBERS.  ALL VARIABLE POOL VARIABLE
*        NAMES HAVE ALSO BEEN PREFIXED "XMT".  NOTE THAT TUTORIAL PANEL
*        MEMBER NAMES ALWAYS END WITH CHAR "T".
*
*      : ALLOCATE A MODEL NICKNAMES DATASET AND MODIFY CLIST "XMT"
*        ACCORDINGLY.
*
*      : MEMBER $SAMPLE CONTAINS THE IDTF SCREEN AS SEEN BY THE USER
*
*      : REVIEW PANEL MEMBERS SUFFIXED "T" (TUTORIALS) FOR A FUNCTIONAL
*        OVERVIEW OF THIS APPLICATION.
*
*      : REVIEW MEMBER TSOHELP. IT CONTAINS A MODIFIED VERSION OF THE
*        IBM DEFAULT 'SYS1.HELP' FOR BOTH THE TRANSMIT AND RECEIVE
*        COMMANDS.  YOU MUST RETROFIT THESE MODIFIED HELP TEXTS INTO
*        PREFERABLY YOUR SITE'S OWN HELP PDS.  THIS IS NOT A REQUIRED
*        INSTALL STEP BUT IT DOES LEND ITSELF NICELY TO THE VIEW OF
*        IDTF THAT IS PRESENTED TO THE USER VIA THIS DIALOG.
