)F
       You may transmit sequential or partitioned datasets that have
       the fixed, variable and undefined (load modules) record format
       (i.e., RECFM=F,FB,FBA,V,VB,VBA,U).

       When you transmit a partitioned dataset, the IEBCOPY utility is
       invoked to transmit the dataset.  Messages will be generated on
       your terminal during IEBCOPY processing.  RECEIVE processing
       will then restore the partitioned dataset to its original format
       for the targeted user (Destination).  You may also transmit a
       single member of a partitioned dataset and request that it be
       transmitted as a sequential dataset, thereby allowing the
       addressee to receive it either as a sequential dataset or as a
       member of another partitioned dataset.


       Additional OPTIONAL OPERANDS that may be used are:

        MSGDS(datasetname)     - send a dataset as a message

        FILE(ddname)           - send data allocated to a ddname

        SEQ  You may request that a member of a partitioned dataset be
             transmitted as a sequential data set.  This allows the
             addressee to receive the file as a sequential data set or
             as a member of a partitioned data set.  Transmitting a
             sequential dataset does not require specification of the
             SEQ operand.

****** Begin customized help for the   RECEIVE command  **********
)F
         The TSO/E RECEIVE command allows you to obtain files
         TRANSMITted to your TSO userid. During TSO LOGON, the RECEIVE
         command is invoked automatically.  If there is at least one
         file that has been TRANSMITted to you, RECEIVE will display
         descriptive information about the file. You will then be
         prompted for information to control the RECEIVE operation
         (Prompts ending with a plus sign indicate that additional info
         is available. Request this info by entering a question mark).
         You may choose to accept the default dataset name (the origin
         dataset name with your prefix replacing the sender's userid)
         and space information by simply pressing the key marked
         ENTER.  You may also specify overriding parameters as
         described later on.  After you have successfully received a
         file, the RECEIVE command will continue processing with any
         remaining files that may have been transmitted to you.  A
         notification of receipt, by you, and the success of your
         RECEIVE command processing will be transmitted back to the
         sender automatically.

         A TRANSMITted file will be retained on the system until you
         successfully RECEIVE or delete it.

         The RECEIVE command may be requested any time during a TSO/
         SPF session by entering "TSO RECEIVE" in the "===> COMMAND"
         field of any SPF panel or requesting RECEIVE Processing in
         the IDTF Utility panel (SPF Option 3.10).

)X
         The RECEIVE command will prompt you for additional parameters.
         If you do not specify any parameters, they will be defaulted
         or obtained from the control records transmitted with the
         data.  The optional parameters which you may specify are:

           BLKSIZE(size)

           DATASET(dsn)

           DIRECTORY(blocks)

           NEW/OLD/MOD/SHR

           RELEASE

           COPY / DELETE / END

           SPACE(primary secondary)

           TRACKS / CYLINDERS / BLOCKS(size)

         Reading the HELP file for the TRANSMIT command will solidify
         your understanding of the RECEIVE command.

))DATASET          You may specify the name of the data set to be
                   used to contain the file being received. This
                   dataset will be created if it does not exist.

                   The dataset name will default to the name of
                   the transmitted data set (the sender's userid
                   will be replaced with your userid).  If this
                   default data set already exists and is a
                   sequential data set and you have not specified
                   a disposition (SHR/MOD/OLD/NEW), then RECEIVE
                   will prompt you for your permission to overwrite
                   the data set. If the default data set is a
                   partitioned data set, then identically named
                   members will be automatically replaced.

))SPACE            You may specify primary and optionally secondary
                   space for the data set in which you are about
                   to receive the file.
                   The default value for SPACE is a primary size
                   equal to the size of the data set you are
                   about to receive and a secondary size value 10
                   percent of the primary space allocation.

))TRACKS           If you enter this keyword, you are requesting
                   that the space allocation be in tracks.

))CYLINDERS        If you enter this keyword, you are requesting
                   that the space allocation be in cylinders.

))BLKSIZE          If you enter this keyword, you are requesting
                   that the space allocation be in units of the blksize
                   value.

))RELEASE          You may request RECEIVE to release any unused
                   space associated with the data set just received
                   by specifying this parameter.

))DIRECTORY        You may override the number of directory blocks
                   for a partitioned data set by specifying this
                   parameter.  The default value for the DIRECTORY
                   keyword is the number of directory blocks required
                   to receive the transmitted members.

                   NOTE:  If you are receiving a sequential data set
                   as a NEW partitioned data set, DATASET(x(member01)),
                   and you do NOT specify the DIRECTORY keyword, the
                   RECEIVE command assumes a default directory block
                   value of 27.

))BLKSIZE          You may specify the blocksize to be used when
                   receiving the file.  Your value will be used
                   as long as it does not conflict with the
                   transmitted data set characteristics or device
                   type characteristics.

))NEW/OLD/MOD/SHR  You may specify the disposition to be used for
                   the data set you are receiving into. If you DO
                   NOT specify one of these values AND you also
                   DID NOT specify the SPACE keyword, RECEIVE will
                   first assume that the data set exists.  If the
                   RECEIVE command determines that the data set does
                   not exist, the data set is allocated NEW with
                   the space values of the original data set.
                   Using MOD when receiving into an existing
                   SEQuential dataset causes the file being RECEIVEd
                   to be appended to the existing dataset.


))DELETE           You may request RECEIVE to delete the current
                   file without any further processing by specifying
                   this keyword.  If DELETE is specified as a RECEIVE
                   processing option, no other options should be
                   specified.

))END              You may request RECEIVE to end its processing
                   immediately, leaving any files available to be
                   RECEIVEd at a later time by you.  If END is
                   specified as a RECEIVE processing option, no other
                   options should be specified.
