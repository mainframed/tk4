* The comments inside the box which you are now reading may be        *
* deleted from this file or remain if desired.                        *
*                                                                     *
* This is a model NICKNAMES file that has been created for you to     *
* customize and use.  The use of NICKNAMES will simplify the use of   *
* the IDTF utility by enabling data to be sent to a nickname          *
* instead of having to remember specific NODE & USERID combinations.  *
*                                                                     *
* A nickname may be a single USERID located at a particular NODE (as  *
* reflected in the example for nickname "BARNUM" below) or a NICKNAME *
* may be created that references a list of individual NICKNAMES,      *
* thereby creating a "mailing list"  or group transmit capability.    *
* There is virtually no limit to the number of combinations of        *
* individual or group NICKNAMES that you may create.                  *
*                                                                     *
* Please enter "your name" in the :PROLOG & :EPILOG titles below.     *
* These titles will automatically be included with any data that you  *
* transmit. You may change these titles anytime.                      *
*                                                                     *
* General guidelines for customizing this file:                       *
*                                                                     *
* 1. Do not alter the first two entries (:LOG & :NOTIFY).             *
* 2. Modify the :PROLOG. & :EPILOG. entries as desired.               *
* 3. Place Group nicknames (via :LIST.) before individual nicknames.  *
*    A group nickname example is the entry "BIGGUYS" below.           *
* 4. Code nicknames defining individual userids last in this file.    *
*    An individual nickname example is the entry "BARNUM" below.      *
* 5. When creating or modifying entries, follow these rules:          *
*    - Group nicknames (:LIST.) may be from 1 to 8 alphanumeric chars.*
*    - Individual nicknames (:NODE.) may be from 1 to 8 (alphanumeric)*
*    - Lists (:LIST.) may include as many combinations of nicknames as*
*      will fit on a line (you may scroll right and continue a LIST). *
*    - Valid locations (:NODE.) are ABL, WILM, and SALTLAKE           *
*    - Valid userids (:USERID.) are of the format D060nnn for ABL     *
*      users and T060nnn for WILM & SALTLAKE users.                   *
*    - Names (:NAME.) are optional (but recommended) and may contain  *
*      as many characters as will fit on a line (you may scroll right *
*      and continue a NAME).                                          *
*                                                                     *
