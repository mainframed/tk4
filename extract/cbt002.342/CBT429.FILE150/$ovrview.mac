 * DOC: OVERVIEW: AUTOMATED (ISPF) INTERACTIVE DATA XMISSION FACILITY
 *    : MARK DIEHL - HERCULES/Allegany Ballistics Lab 304-726-5140/5343
 *
 *    The "TRANSMIT/RECEIVE" utility is an IDPF/PDF-based dialog that
 *    automates the use of TSO/E's IDTF commands "TRANSMIT" & "RECEIVE".
 *    It was developed under TSO/E V1.3, and ISPF/PDF v2.2.
 *
 *    From one panel, the casual user can initiate data transfer without
 *    having to know much detail about command operands but also the
 *    capability is provided  for the experienced IDTF user to really
 *    make data dance.  NICKNAME processing capability is provided. For
 *    new IDTF users, NICKNAME usage is assisted by the automatic
 *    creation of a prototype nicknames dataset, complete with
 *    customization instructions contained within.  IDTF LOG and RECEIVE
 *    processing is available from the same PANEL. As an added extra,
 *    provided that data is transmitted from same-node to same-node, a
 *    friendly TSO message (via the old TSO "SEND" cmd) notifies the
 *    targeted user(s) of incoming data. This dynamic notification
 *    occurs even if transmitting to individual or group nicknames (each
 *    user in a group will be sent a "data has been transmitted to
 *    you" message). Of course, tutorial panels are included.
