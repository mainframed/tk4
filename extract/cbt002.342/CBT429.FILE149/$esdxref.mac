-FUNCTION
0     Program 'ESDXREF' may be used to produce a cross reference
      listing of all external symbol directory (ESD) entries within a
      load module library or set of libraries. The program produces
      both a list of all module names for each ESD name and all ESD
      names for each module name.
-PROCESSING
0     The program first searches the TIOT and builts a list of all
      DDNAMES beginning with 'XREF'. Then, for each load module library
      associated with each DDNAME, all ESD entries for all members in
      the library are read and the ESD data is mapped into an incore
      table. After all ESD data has been read into core, the table is
      first sorted in order by ESD name and a cross reference list of
      modules by ESD name is printed. Next, the table is sorted in
      order by module name and a cross reference list of ESD names by
      module names is printed. The program then terminates.
-EXEC CARD PARMS
0     None.
-DD CARDS
0     STEPLIB  - library containing 'ESDXREF' (may be JOBLIB or in
                 LINKLST)

      XREFkkkk - load module library reference
      XREFllll - load module library reference 2 (optional)
      XREFmmmm - load module library reference 3 (optional)

-COMMENTS/CAUTIONS
0     1 - The program requires 16 bytes per module/esd entry. The
          region available to the program must be large enough to
          contain all entries to complete successfully.
      2 - note that all libraries associated with DDNAMES beginning
          with 'XREF' are processed 'enmasse'. Thus if duplicate
          module names exist in separate libraries, the ESD entries
          for both modules will be 'logically' merged by the table
          sort and the output cross reference listing will be
          incorrect for both modules.
