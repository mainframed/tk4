                   PRINT CONTROL MACRO

         OACPRTPM  PRINT=

         THIS MACRO EXAMINS THE VALUES OF &OACPRTG, &OACPRTF, AND
         THE SUPPLIED PRINT= KEYWORD AND GENERATES A PUSH PRINT,
         A PRINT OFF,NOGEN(IF REQUIRED) AND SETS THE VALUES OF
         &OACPRT AND &OACPRTS ACCORDING TO OAC CONVENTIONS:
         THE PRINT ENVIRONMENT OF AN OAC GENERATED MACRO MAY
         HAVE THREE VALUES:

         ALL-   PRINT ON,GEN; ALL COMMENTS; EJECTS AS APPROPRIATE

         SHORT- PRINT ON,GEN; NO COMMENTS; EJECTS REPLACED BY SPACE 1

         NONE-  PRINT OFF,NOGEN
         THIS ENVIRONMENT WILL BE DETERMINED BY THE VALUE OF THE
         GLOBAL SYMBOL &OACPRTG, THIS VALUE MAY BE OVERRIDEN BY
         THE PRINT= KEYWORD ON INDIVIDUAL MACROS UNLESS THE
         GLOBAL &OACPRTF IS SET TO 1 IN WHICH CASE THE PRINT=
         KEYWORD IS IGNORED.

         IN GENERAL AN OAC MACRO SHOULD HAVE THE FOLLOWING SKELETON:

         MACRO
&LABEL   OACNAME .....,&PRINT=
         COPY  OACGBLS
         OACPRTPM PRINT=&PRINT
         AIF   ('&OACPRT' EQ 'SHORT').NOCOMMS
         . . .
.NOCOMMS ANOP
         . . .
         POP   PRINT
         MEND

         WITHIN SUCH A MACRO, EJECTS SHOULD BE REPLACED BY:

         SPACE &OACPRTS

         WHICH WILL RESULT IN AN EJECT IF THE PRINT ENVIRONMENT IS
         ALL AND A SPACE 1 IF THE PRINT ENVIRONMENT IS SHORT.
