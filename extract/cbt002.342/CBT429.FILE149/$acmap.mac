         DSECT GEN MACRO

         OACMAP  DSECT=CB-NAME-LIST, PRINT=

         GENERATES A DSECT FOR EACH OF THE NAMED CONTROL BLOCKS.
         NOTE: SINCE THE "APPROVED" IBM MACROS ARE USED TO
               GENERATE THE DSECTS, THE DSECT NAME MAY NOT
               BE THE SAME AS THE CONTROL BLOCK NAME.

         CB-NAME-LIST,
                   THE "COMMON" NAME OF CONTROL BLOCKS FOR WHICH
                   A DSECT IS TO BE GENERATED. EG: TCB, JSCB, ...
                   NOTE: IF THE NAME IS NOT RECOGNIZED BY THE
                         OACMAP MACRO IT IS USED AS A MACRO NAME
                         TO GENERATE THE DESIRED DSECT. THIS IS
                         A RELATIVELY PAINLESS WAY OF FOLLOWING
                         THE OAC PRINT CONTROL CONVENTIONS.
                   THE "COMMON" NAME FOR THE SVC99
                   DSECTS ARE: SVC99 FOR EVERYTHING
                               SVC99BLK FOR THE DATA AREAS
                               SVC99EQU FOR THE EQU'S

         PRINT=    ALL, OR SHORT, OR NONE, OR EMPTY
                   ALL   - PRINT ON,GEN
                   SHORT - SHORT FORM OF MACRO EXPANSION
                   NONE  - PRINT OFF,NOGEN
                   EMPTY - THE VALUE OF &OACPRTG CONTROLS THE
                           PRINT BEHAVIOR.
