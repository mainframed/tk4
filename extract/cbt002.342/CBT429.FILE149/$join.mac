          JOIN - match two files

  JOIN matches two input files on a specified key and produces
three output files containing the result of the match.

//JOIN     EXEC PGM=JOIN,
//     PARM='<offset1>,<offset2>,<field len>,<order>,...'
//STEPLIB DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS5.mssload
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*                  * record counts *
//SYSUDUMP DD SYSOUT=*
//IN1      DD ---                       * input file 1  *
//IN2      DD ---                       * input file 2  *
//OUT1     DD ---                       * output file 1 *
//OUT2     DD ---                       * output file 2 *
//OUT3     DD ---                       * output file 3 *

  IN1 records must each have a unique key
  IN2 records are not required to have a unique key

  Both of the input files must be in order by the specified fields
  or the results are unpredictable.

  If there is more than one record in IN2 with a matching key
  of a record in IN1 then two output records will be output
  to OUT3 each containing the same record from IN1 and
  one of the records from IN2.

  OUT1 will contain the records from IN1 not matched in IN2.
  OUT2 will contain the records from IN2 not matched in IN1.
  OUT3 will contain the records in both IN1 and IN2 concatenated
    together with IN1 first. (hard to use if the IN1 records
    are recfm=v as there is only 1 rdw in the resulting record)

   the parameter field specifies the position(s) of the key.
(more than one field may be specified).  Each field
is specified as:
     the offset of the field (origin 1, range 1 -> 4095) in IN1 records
     the offset of the field (origin 1, range 1 -> 4095) in IN2 records
     the length of the field (origin 0, range 1 -> 256)
     the sort order of the field (a or d)

  the output files can be any recfm/lrecl,
RDW's will be build/destroyed and the resulting records
will be truncated or padded if required.
