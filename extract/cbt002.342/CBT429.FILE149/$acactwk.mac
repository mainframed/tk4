                           OAC accounting work area def

 name     OACACTWK  DSECT=,
                    PREFIX=

   The OACACTWK macro describes the accounting work area used
 internally by the initiator and related routines at OAC.

-- DSECT=YES
  If this keyword is specified as NO then no dsect card will be
  generated, otherwise a dsect will be generated.

-- PREFIX=ACT
  This specifies the prefix to be used to generate labels
  in the macro expansion. (This allows multiple expansions of this
  area in one assembly.


 The use of this macro is restricted to system routines
 involved with the initiator or accouting.  A severity 21
 MNOTE will result if used in other than specific routines.
