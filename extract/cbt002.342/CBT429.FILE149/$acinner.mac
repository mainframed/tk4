                            OAC inner macro

    PURPOSE: To provide a consistent way of efficiently generating
             instructions to manipulate parms passed to macros.

             The OACINNER macro accepts addresses of the form:

             (Rn)     - The specified register itself.

             0(Rn)    - The address contained in the register

             sym   or - The specified address
             sym+off
             sym-off
             off(Rn)

             (addr,i) - The contents of storage at location addr

    SYNTAX:

   label OACINNER F=,FO=+0,                                            x
                  T=,TO=+0,                                            x
                  L=4,                                                 x
                  OP=MA,                                               x
                  COM='',                                              x
                  SETCC=NO,                                            x
                  RS=R0,RT=R15

         F=    The source for this operation. Usually a passed parm.
         FO=   The offset from the passed parm to be used for this
               operation.

         T=    The target for this operation. Usually a passed parm.
         TO=   The offset from the passed parm to be used for this
               operation.

         L=    The length to be used for this operation. Note that
               MOVE ADDRESS has an implied length of four and that
               some combinations of addresses, lengths, and operations
               are illegal.

         OP=   The operation to be performed:

               MA  - Move Address. The address of the source is moved
                     to the target. The implied length is four. The
                     high order byte will be destroyed, but may not
                     be zeroed.

               MAC - Move Address and Clear high byte.

               M   - Move. The contents of the source is moved to
                     the target.

               O   - Or. The contents of the source is or'd into
                     the target.

               X   - eXclusive or. The contents of the source is
                     exclusive or'd into the target

               N   - aNd. The contents of the source is and'd into
                     the target.

               CL  - Compare Logical. The contents of the source is
                     compared with the target.

               MVI - These operands are included for completeness.
               CLI
               TM
               OI
               NI
               XI

         COM=  A comment to be put in the comment field of the
               first generated instruction. Note. the argument
               to this keyword MUST be enclosed in quotes.

         SETCC= Set condition code. If SETCC=YES is coded, and
              the operation would not normally cause the condition
              code to be set. The macro will turn a LR into a LTR,
              or will generate a LTR or CLC to set the condition
              code on the value of the target.

         RS=R0,RT=R15 Work registers for the macro. Note that RT
              will not be used unless an Indarect target was specified.
