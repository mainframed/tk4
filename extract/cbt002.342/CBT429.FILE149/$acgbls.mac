         MEMBER INTENDED AS COPY CODE TO DECLARE THE STANDARD
         OAC GLOBAL ASM SYMBOLS:

         &OACPRTG GBLC '' OR 'ALL' OR 'SHORT' OR 'NONE'
                  USED TO CONTROLE THE PRINT-EXPANSION OF
                  OAC DEFINED MACROS. SEE OACPRTPM MACRO
                  DOCUMENTATION FOR BEHAVIOR.

         &OACPRT GBLC '' OR 'ALL' OR 'SHORT' OR 'NONE'
                  THE SYMBOL SET BY OACPRTPM BASED ON THE
                  VALUES OF &OACPRTG, &OACPRTF, AND THE
                  PRINT= KEYWORD ON THE INDIVIDUAL MACRO.

         &OACPRTS GBLA 1 OR 99
                  SET TO 1 BY OACPRTM IF THE CALCULATED
                  VALUE OF &OACPRT IS 'SHORT' ELSE SET TO 99.
                  THE INTENDED USE OF THIS VARIABLE IS AS AN
                  ARGUMENT TO SPACE TO CAUSE EITHER AN EJECT OR
                  A SPACE 1.

         &OACPRTF GBLB
                  IF SET TO 1 THE VALUE OF &OACPRTG WILL
                  OVERIDE THE VALUE OF THE PRINT= KEYWORD
                  ON INDIVIDUAL MACROS.

         &OACNAME GBLC
                  This contains a name field to be generated
                  by some OAC inner macro or nulls.  (If there
                  was no name field on the outer macro or the
                  name field has already been generated then
                  this global will contain nulls.
