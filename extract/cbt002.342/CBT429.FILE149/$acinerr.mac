              ERROR BRANCH INNER MACRO

name     OACINERR addr

  -- addr
   This operand specifies the address for the error branch.  If
   the address is specified as in a register, then a branch
   register will be generated.

   A second sub-operand may be specified as one of:

   Z  -  branch on condition code zero
         (This is the reverse of normal and results in
          a branch on no-error to the specified address)

   NZ -  branch on condition code not-zero
         (This is the default if this sub-operand is omitted and
          results in a branch on error to the specified address)

   A third sub-operand may be specified.  This specifies that
   the condition code is not already set, a LTR from R15 to
   the register specified in the third sub-operand will be
   generated before the conditional branch.  Note that
   R15 may be specified, which will generate a LTR R15,R15.

  The following are samples of the use of this macro.  A real
  example of usage is contained in OACCALL.

         MACRO
&NAME    SAMPLE &DUMMY,&ERROR=
&NAME    BAL   R14,MYSUB
         OACINERR &ERROR
         MEND

  This might generate:

    L1    SAMPLE ERROR=DIE
   +L1    BAL  R14,MYSUB
   +      BNZ  DIE

    L1    SAMPLE ERROR=(ALLOK,Z)
   +L1    BAL  R14,MYRTN
   +      BZ   ALLOK

    L1    SAMPLE ERROR=((R8),Z)
   +L1    BAL  R14,MYRTN
   +      BZR  R8

    L1    SAMPLE ERROR=((R8),NZ,R6)
   +L1    BAL   R14,MYRTN
   +      LTR   R6,R15
   +      BNZR  R8
