   #RTN       Standard linkage macro borrowed from the NaSPA VIP tape

   FORTUNE    This is an edited fortune cookie file from an old DEC
              PDP-11 RSTS/E system that I've been carrying around with
              me for more than 10 years.  I've cleaned it up quite a
              bit and made it easy for anyone to format:  Just add your
              own .QUOTE and .ATTR macros and run it through your
              favorite text processor (or DCF).  I believe it came from
              an old DECUS tape, so it should be public domain.

   PELISTR5   Modified version of Michael Gearing's PELIST program from
              file 18 of the NaSPA VIP tape.  I have modified it to
              work with SMP/E Release 5 zones.

   SMLDATA    An entire season of bowling scores for SMLSTAT

   SMLJCL     Sample JCL to run SMLSTAT

   SMLSTAT    Bowling statistics program written in PL/I.  I wrote this
              program specifically for my league (Seymour Men's League)
              for use with a Xerox 4045 printer, so it will probably
              need to be modified for other leagues and/or printers.
              It's not incredibly well documented, so anybody who
              wants to use it and has any questions should feel free to
              call me.

   VTOCSCAN   Program to scan all online DASD VTOCs for non-zero values
              in the four reserved bytes beginning at offset x'4E' in
              the DSCBs.  This program is useful if you run third-party
              DASD management software (e.g. DMS) and are planning to
              install DFP Version 3.
