  VERSION 2 CBTMODS INFO/MVS DATABASE INSTALLATION

  1. EDIT BLGS11 FOR INSTALLATION DEPENDENT DATA SET NAMES TO CREATE
     SESSION PARAMETER MODULE BLGSES11.  THIS CAN BE IN A TSO STEPLIB
     OR LINKLIST LIBRARY.

  2. RUN CBTOZD MEMBER TO READ FILE ONE OF CBT MODIFICATION TAPE
     AND CREATE INPUT FILE FOR BLGOZUD UTILITY.

  3. RUN CBTAMS TO DELETE, DEFINE, AND INITIALIZE THE CBTMODS INFO/MVS
     DATABASE FILES.

  4. RUN CBTBLD TO LOAD THE CBTMODS INFO/MVS DATABASE FILES.

  5. COPY INFOMGT CLIST TO APPROPRIATE CLIST LIBRARY.

  6. COPY INFOMGTP PANEL TO APPROPRIATE ISPPLIB LIBRARY.
     (IF YOU HAVE NEVER USED VERSION 2 BEFORE, ALSO COPY BLG#PRIM
      FROM SYS1.BLGMAC2 TO THE APPROPRIATE ISPPLIB LIBRARY.)

  7. ADD THE INFORMATION/SYSTEM DIALOG TO A PANELS AS SHOWN IN THE
     EXAMPLE PANEL, ISR@PRIM.

  8. INVOKE THE INFOMATION/SYSTEM DIALOG SPECIFYING A SESSION PARAMETER
     OF 11.  DO YOUR SEARCHES ON FILE 1 (SE =1 KEYWORD).

  I BELIEVE THIS SHOULD ALSO WORK FOR VERSION 3, BUT I HAVE NO WAY OF
  KNOWING FOR SURE UNTIL WE INSTALL THAT VERSION.
