This file (CBT File 90) contains the "Delinker" package written by

                          David W. Noon

which consists of source code (PL/I and Assembler) and documentation.


David Noon can be contacted by email:  dwnoon@ibm.net           -or-
                                       dwnoon@compuserve.com

In March 1999, someone asked how to read and write RECFM=U data from
PL/I in the comp.lang.pl1 USENET newsgroup.  David Noon posted that
if a delinker written in PL/I was wanted then just ask.  That's not
what the original poster wanted, but I asked instead, and Dave duly
emailed it to me.

The package turned out to be a powerful batch utility to delink,
resize and even package for later processing (such as distribution
and reinstallation) some or all CSECTs of nominated load modules.
It could, for example, be used in a job stream to replace certain
CSECTs with newer versions.

I ended up plugging it into REVIEW R31.0 (CBT File 134), so that
members tagged in the member list (or all members if none are
tagged) can be dynamically delinked.

Please note that this Delinker will not process scatter-load or
segment-overlay programs correctly.  It will only process load
modules, and not program objects.

In case you do not have a suitable PL/I compiler handy, I have supplied
DELINKI and DWNSPDSR load modules in CBT File 135.  I proposed calling
the program DELINK1 to distinguish it from the DELINK/DELINK0 OS/360
FE Tool (and its derivatives), but Sam Golob preferred DELINKI, so
DELINKI it is.  (The 1 or I denotes that it is written in PL/I.)

A member contents list follows.

$$DOC    - This member.

DCFDOC   - This is a documentation source file Dave made in SGML.
           It can easily be converted to GML and run through SCRIPT/VS.
           It can be TEXT transferred to DELINK.IPF on the PC for
           processing by the IPF compiler.  I resolved a lot (but not
           all) of character symbolics to get it to fit into an
           80-column file.  It also made the uncompiled source more
           readable.
              &apos.             was replaced by   '
              &asterisk.         was replaced by   *
              &colon.            was replaced by   :
              &comma.            was replaced by   ,
              &eq.               was replaced by   =
              &hyphen.           was replaced by   -
              &lpar.             was replaced by   (
              &per.              was replaced by   .
              &plus.             was replaced by   +
              &rpar.             was replaced by   )
              &slash.            was replaced by   /

DELINK   - This is the main PL/I source member.
           It should be compiled with OS PL/I Version 2 or with PL/I
           for MVS & VM.  Requires DWNSCAN and DWNSHEX to be linked
           into the program executable, and DWNSPDSR to be fetchable
           during execution.

DWNMPRLG - PL/I prologue macro used by DWNSCAN and DWNSHEX.
           Seems to work for OS PL/I Version 2 and PL/I for MVS & VM.

DWNSCAN  - Performs the same function as the PL/I SEARCH built-in
           function.  The SEARCH and SEARCHR built-in functions are
           not yet available under MVS (OS/390) at the time of writing.
           This module should be assembled and made available at bind
           (ie. link-edit) time for inclusion into the main program.

DWNSHEX  - Performs a similar function to the PL/I HEX built-in
           function.  The HEX and HEXIMAGE built-in functions are
           not yet available under MVS (OS/390) at the time of writing.
           This module should be assembled and made available at bind
           (ie. link-edit) time for inclusion into the main program.

DWNSPDSR - Provides BPAM support for the main PL/I program.
           It should be assembled and made available for dynamic
           fetching at execute time.

DWNYBLDL - PL/I source structure for PDS program directory entry.
           It was obviously meant to be included in the source by some
           strange control card (not %INCLUDE), so I just copied it
           into the source.  This member is therefore no longer used.

FMBLOCK  - Housekeeping macros used by DWNSPDSR, all of which were
FMCREDT    probably contributed to the SHARE tape by Ken True of
FMSTART    Fairchild MSS (hence FM, no doubt).  They were moved from
FMWORK1    from the SHARE tape to the Fairchild MSS "Mods" tape,
FMWORK2    later called the Intel MVS "Mods" tape, circa 1982.

PLIICB   - PL/I Interrupt Control Block macro used by DWNSHEX
           on error conditions.

PLISIG   - PL/I Signal macro used by DWNSHEX on error conditions.

XMITBOOK - TSO/E transmit file of DELINK.INF which was created by
           compiling DELINK.IPF (source in member DCFDOC) with IPFC
           under OS/2.  Process with INDATASET operand of the TSO/E
           RECEIVE command to get a RECFM=U sequential data set.
           BINARY transfer this file to the PC (byte counts should
           match).  Use the VIEW command of OS/2 or PC-DOS to look
           at DELINK.INF which contains the Delinker documentation.
           The PC-DOS VIEW command also works from the MS-DOS prompt
           (including under Win95).  Apparently, there is an IVIEW
           command downloadable from IBM designed to work under Win95.
