                  Documentation for DQNAME Program

   This program was written by a member of GRS Level 2 support at
the IBM Support Center.  It was faxed to me and I retyped it in.
I compared it line for line, and the only significant thing changed
was a more proper coding of Load, LA and ST instructions with the
index register being zero.  For example:

     ST    15,8(13)   was replaced by      ST    15,8(,13)

Otherwise, the program is identical to the one faxed to me.  Note that
no register equates were used.  I would have put them in, but it would
have made the initial comparison with the faxed text tougher.  I first
wanted to make sure that the program would work as I typed it in.

Now that we have it machine-readable, maybe someone would like to put
the register equates in, and send a diskette or tape back to me.
Also, if anyone has improvements, for example a hex display that
would show how many blanks are in the RNAME, these would be welcome.
