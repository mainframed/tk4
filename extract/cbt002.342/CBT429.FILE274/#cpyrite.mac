°This  library  contains a complete Dynamic PROCLIB modification.  This
°modification is designed for use with MVS/SP 4.1.0 and  later.    This
°version  of  Dynamic  PROCLIB  is  a  complete rewrite of the previous
°version of Dynamic PROCLIB (3.2.4  and  earlier),  while,  with  minor
°exceptions, maintaining compatibility.

°NOTE:    This  version  of  Dynamic  PROCLIB  is not applicable to MVS
°Systems before Version 4.

°ration,  even  though  it  is  essentially in the public domain.   The

°This  Version  of  Dynamic  PROCLIB  makes use of internal IBM Control
°Blocks in order to perform it's function.  Because of this, all  proc-
°essing that is dependent on internal IBM Control Blocks and interfaces
°has  been  isolated into a small, separate module which is distributed
°as Object Code Only.  Amdahl Corporation, while not guaranteeing  this
°code,  will,  on  a best effort basis, fully support this code.  After
°all, this code is running in Amdahl's Internal Data Center  and  their
°Users are dependent on it.
