         DYNAMIC PROCLIB TOLERATION MODIFICATION

         THE DYNAMIC PROCLIB MODIFICATION IS NOT NEEDED IN
         MVS/SP VERSION 4.  HOWEVER, A SINCE A JOB CONTAINING
         A "JOBPROC" DD STATEMENT CAN BE CONVERTED ON A
         PRE-MVS/SP VERSION 4 SYSTEM AND SELECTED FOR EXECUTION
         ON AN MVS/SP VERSION 4 SYSTEM (VIA SHARED SPOOL),
         THE INTERPRETER MUST STILL HAVE LOGIC TO DELETE THE
         JOBPROC DD STATEMENT.

         ONCE ALL SYSTEMS ARE TOTALLY CONVERTED TO MVS/SP VERSION 4
         AND THE JCLLIB STATEMENT IS IN USE, THIS MODIFICATION
         CAN BE REMOVED.

         IEFVDA IS THE INTERPRETER DD STATEMENT PROCESSOR.  THE
         ZAP CHANGES IEFVDA TO CHECK FOR A "DD DYNAM" BEFORE
         THE FIRST EXEC STATEMENT AND CAUSE IT TO BE BYPASSED.
         IEFVPP FLAGS JOBPROC DD STATEMENTS AS IF THEY WERE DD
         DYNAM STATEMENTS.  IF THIS IS NOT DONE, ANY JOB WITH A
         JOBPROC DD STATEMENT WILL RECEIVE A "MISPLACED DD
         STATEMENT" JCL ERROR.

                                                                  */ .
