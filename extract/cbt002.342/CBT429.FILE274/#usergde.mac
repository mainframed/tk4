°The MVS Dynamic PROCLIB Facility provides a User of MVS to specify the
°libraries  that are to be search for JCL Procedures without them being
°known in advance to the Job Entry SubSystem.

°Dynamic PROCLIBs are specified by the User as part of his or her Job's
°JCL via the use of one  or  more  JOBPROC  DD  Statements,  much  like
°JOBLIBs  and JOBCATs are specified.  The JOBPROC DD Statements and any
°concatenations (following standard JCL rules for  concatenation)  must
°be  specified  before  the  first EXEC Statement.   The JOBPROC DDname
°becomes a restricted DDname which can only be used  for  this  purpose
°and  any other use of a DDname of JOBPROC within a Job will be consid-
°ered a JCL Error.

°The JOBPROC DD Statements must specify, as a  minimum,  the  Data  Set
°Name  of the JCL Procedure Library.  The JCL Procedure Library must be
°a Fixed Blocked Partitioned Data  Set  (PDS)  with  a  Logical  Record
°Length  (LRECL)  of 80.   The JOBPROC specified Data Set must be cata-
°logued in a System Catalog (Master or User) using a defined high level
°index (alias).  JOBPROC specified Data Sets CANNOT be  located  via  a
°JOBCAT specification.  No other JCL Parameters are necessary.

°The  only  other  JCL  Parameters  on the JOBPROC DD Statement that is
°examined is the SYSPROC Parameter.   The SYSPROC  Parameter  has  been
°added  to JCL specifically for use on the JOBPROC DD Statement.  It is
°valid ONLY on the initial JOBPROC DD Statement  (not  on  any  concat-
°enation)   and   specifies   either   SYSPROC=YES,  SYSPROC=FIRST,  or
°SYSPROC=NO.    The  default  depends  on   an   installation   option.
°SYSPROC=YES  means that the System default Procedure Libraries will be
°automatically  concatenated  AFTER  the  JOBPROC  specified  Procedure
°Libraries.    SYSPROC=FIRST  means  that  the System default Procedure
°Libraries will be automatically concatenated BEFORE the JOBPROC speci-
°fied Procedure Libraries.  SYSPROC=NO means that  the  System  default
°Procedure  Libraries will NOT be concatenated after the JOBPROC speci-
°fied Procedure Libraries and that only the  User  specified  Libraries
°will be searched for any required procedures.

°The  maximum  number  of  Procedure Libraries that can be specified in
°JOBPROC DD Statements is 16.  This number is reduced  by  the  use  of
°SYSPROC=YES  or  SYSPROC=FIRST.    If  SYSPROC=YES or SYSPROC=FIRST is
°specified (or defaulted),  the  number  of  User  specified  Procedure
°Libraries  is  decreased  by  the  number  of System default Procedure
°Libraries.

°User specified JOBPROC Data Sets must reside on mounted Direct  Access
°Volumes.    If the specified Data Set does not exist on Direct Access,
°exists on a Volume that is not mounted, or is not a  Partitioned  Data
°Set,  the  Job will be failed with a JCL Error.  There is no provision
°to allow the Operator to mount the Volume before JCL Conversion.

°The installation also has the ability to restrict which Data Sets  can
