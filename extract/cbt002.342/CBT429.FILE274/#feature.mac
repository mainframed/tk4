¸
°This  library  contains a complete Dynamic PROCLIB modification.  This
°modification is designed for use with MVS/SP 4.1.0 and  later.    This
°version  of  Dynamic  PROCLIB  is  a  complete rewrite of the previous
°version of Dynamic PROCLIB (3.2.4  and  earlier),  while,  with  minor
°exceptions, maintaining compatibility.

°NOTE:    This  version  of  Dynamic  PROCLIB  is not applicable to MVS
°Systems before Version 4.

°This Version of Dynamic PROCLIB requires no Superzap modifications  to
°the Converter, even for the SYSPROC parameter.

°The  Superzap  to  Interpreter  Module  IEFVDA  is  necessary only for
°Multi-Access SPOOL compatibility with a Version 3 (or earlier) BCP.

°All customization to  Dynamic  PROCLIB  is  specified  in  a  separate
°Options Module which can be easily updated via SMP/E.

°THE  JCLLIB  and  IF  Statements are optionally enabled even running a
°Pre-Version 4 JES.

°The SYSPROC Parameter now takes values of FIRST, LAST, BEFORE,  AFTER,
°and  NONE, in addition to YES and NO.  The FIRST and BEFORE specifica-
°tions cause the System Procedure Libraries to be concatenated in front
°of the User specified Procedure Libraries.

°A JCLLIB Parameter can be specified on the START  Command,  specifying
°the Procedure Library to be used for the Started Task.

°A  SWA=ABOVE×BELOW  Parameter  is  implemented on the JOB Statement to
°override the default SWA Location specified in the JES Parameters.

°DDnames SWAABOVE and SWABELOW can be used to override the default  SWA
°Location specified in the JES Parameters.

°An  Installation  can restrict the Data Sets that can be specified for
°Dynamic PROCLIB, via inclusion and exclusion lists.    Separate  lists
°are available for Batch Jobs, Started Tasks, and Time Sharing Users.

°The Bad News is ....

°The  ability  to specify a UNIT and VOLUME for an uncatalogued Dynamic
°PROCLIB Data Set has been removed.   Since  the  IBM  supplied  JCLLIB
°Statement requires the PROCLIBs to be catalogued and now-a-days uncat-

°alogued  DASD Data Sets are pretty rare, this is not viewed as a seri-
°ous incompatibility.

°With  the  exception of the ability to specify the JCLLIB Parameter on
°the START Command, the SWA Parameter on the  JOB  Statement,  and  the
°SWAABOVE/SWABELOW  DDnames, this Version of Dynamic PROCLIB is consid-
°ered to be a "temporary" Modification until such time that an  Instal-
°lation  can  get  their JCL converted to use the JCLLIB Statement.  If
°any installation does not make use of the JCLLIB and  SWA  Parameters,
°this modification is completely temporary.

°This  Version  of  Dynamic  PROCLIB  was an early release that did not
