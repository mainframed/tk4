°This  library  contains a complete Dynamic PROCLIB modification.  This
°modification is designed for use with MVS/SP 4.1.0 and  later.    This
°version  of  Dynamic  PROCLIB  is  a  complete rewrite of the previous
°version of Dynamic PROCLIB (3.2.4  and  earlier),  while,  with  minor
°exceptions, maintaining compatibility.

°NOTE:    This  version  of  Dynamic  PROCLIB  is not applicable to MVS
°Systems before Version 4.

°**********************************************************************

°The distributed object module (IEFCNVXT) is fully compatible with  all
°levels  of  MVS/SP  Version  4,  although it has only been tested with
°MVS/SP 4.2.0.

°IEFCNVPP is the source module that contains the bulk  of  the  Dynamic
°PROCLIB  processing.    While  it  is  not  necessary to assemble this
°module, installations may wish to do so to have a  reference  listing.
°IEFCNVOP is the source module that contains all of the program options
°that  an  installation  can customize.   IEFCNVLS is the source module
°that creates inclusion and/or exclusion lists to limit what data  sets
°can  be  used.    Copy Modules are provided for easy updating of these
°lists.  It should be also reassembled with the  appropriate  installa-
°tion specifications.

°Numerous Macros (IEFCNDSN, IEFCNFSA, IEFCNMSG, IEFCNOPT, IEFCNPPW, and
°IEFCNTRC)  are  supplied  to allow the installation to assemble all of
°the supplied Source Modules.   For the  Data  Set  Inclusion/Exclusion
°Module  (IEFCNVLS),  there  are six COPY Modules:  IEFCNVJI, IEFCNVJX,
°IEFCNVSI, IEFCNVSX, IEFCNVTI, and IEFCNVTX.

°Extensive documentation on  the  installation  and  function  of  this
°Dynamic  PROCLIB Modification can be found in other members and in the
°Comments in the SMP/E Modifications.

°This  modification,  while  substantially  different  internally,   is
°externally  compatible  with  previous  Versions (3.2.4 or earlier) of
°Dynamic PROCLIB with one exception.  The ability to specify  UNIT  and
°VOLUME  information  on  the JOBPROC DD Statement has been eliminated.
°As the IBM supplied JCLLIB Statement has this restriction, this is not
°viewed as a major incompatibility.

°The Superzap to Module IEFVDA (Load Module IEFNB903) in the Interpret-
°er is NOT necessary to  this  modification.    All  necessary  Dynamic
°PROCLIB Code is contained in the Converter modifications.  However, in
°a  Multi-Access SPOOL environment, with some Systems running a Version
°4 BCP and others running a Version 3 (or earlier)  BCP,  it  would  be
°possible for a JOB to Convert on a Pre-Version 4 BCP with the previous
°Version  of Dynamic PROCLIB installed and be selected for Execution on

°a Version 4 BCP System.  Hence, the Superzap to Module IEFVDA is need-
°ed  only  for this compatibility situation and can be removed once all
°sharing Systems are running a Version 4 BCP with this modification.

°Note:  Please use extreme care when reworking the Superzap against the
°Interpreter module (IEFVDA) when maintenance or a new release hits it.
°Be sure that the Base/Displacements of the various branches are  prop-
°erly calculated and changed.  0C1s and 0C4s in the Interpreter are the
°most common symptoms when the Superzap is not properly reworked.
