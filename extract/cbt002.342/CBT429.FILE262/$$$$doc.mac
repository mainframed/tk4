                        PTFXREF PROGRAM


      This is another PTF xref program which is useful.  It takes as
input a PTF tape file or disk file, and extracts enough information
from it to produce a list which is sorted by FMID.  This program also
shows information about which apars have been fixed by the PTF.  I
have included trucated output from this program in member TRUNCOUT of
this pds.

     This program was written (many years ago) by Walter Shelley,
of DOITT - City of New York.  The language is VS Cobol 2.4.
Walter recently went over it and got it to work, for recent IBM PTF
formatting.

     This program is admittedly written "quick and dirty", but for
IBM PTFs, it seems to do the job.  The program picks off the
"APARS FIXED:" and "COMPONENT:" strings, printing what comes after
them, besides feeling for the FMID for that PTF.  Walter admits that
the program should be modified to use parsing logic instead of picking
off n bytes that come after these strings.  But IBM is writing its
PTFs pretty standardly.  So the program, as is, is useful.
