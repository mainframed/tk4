)F FUNCTION -
  THE QLIST COMMAND DISPLAYS A SEQUENTIAL DATA SET
  OR A MEMBER OF A PARTITIONED DATA SET ON THE TERMINAL.

  IT IS SIMILAR TO THE LIST COMMAND, WEAKER IN SOME AREAS,
  STRONGER IN OTHERS.  WHEN THE SYSTEM IS UNDER A HEAVY LOAD
  THIS COMMAND WILL RESPOND MUCH FASTER (IN THE TIME BETWEEN
  THE START OF THE COMMAND AND THE FIRST OUTPUT LINE APPEARING)
  THAN THE LIST COMMAND, ESPECIALLY WHEN LISTING A MEMBER.

  FEATURES IN QLIST THAT ARE NOT IN LIST -
     .  FILE KEYWORD FOR LISTING BY DDNAME
     .  HEX KEYWORD
     .  FOR PARTIAL LISTINGS, INSTEAD OF SPECIFYING A SEQUENCE
        NUMBER RANGE YOU SPECIFY THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF RECORDS
        TO PRINT AND/OR THE NUMBER OF RECORDS TO BYPASS.
     .  IF NUM/SNUM/NONUM NOT SPECIFIED, WILL CHECK FOR SEQUENCE
        NUMBERS AND DEFAULT TO NUM OR NONUM ACCORDINGLY.
     .  ASA CARRIAGE CONTROL CHARACTERS WILL APPEAR IF PRESENT.
  FEATURES IN LIST THAT ARE NOT IN QLIST -
     .  PARTIAL LIST BY SEQUENCE NUMBER RANGE.
     .  MULTIPLE COLUMN RANGES.
     .  SPECIFIABLE SEQUENCE FIELD LOCATION AND LENGTH.
     .  MULTIPLE DATA SETS.
     .  LIST RECFM=U DATA SETS.
     .  HEADING LINE SHOWING DATA SET NAME.
)X SYNTAX  -
         QLIST    'DSNAME'  BYPASS('INTEGER')   MAX('INTEGER')
             NUM/SNUM/NONUM   COL('BEGIN COLUMN':'END COLUMN')
             FILE   HEX/X   QUICK/Q
  REQUIRED - DSNAME
  DEFAULTS - NUM (UNLESS A NON-NUMERIC IS ENCOUNTERED, THEN NONUM)
)O OPERANDS -
  'DSNAME' - THE SEQUENTIAL DATA SET OR MEMBER OF A PARTITIONED
             DATA SET TO BE LISTED, OR, IF THE 'FILE' KEYWORD
             IS ALSO SPECIFIED, THE FILENAME (DDNAME) CURRENTLY
             ALLOCATED TO THE DATASET OR MEMBER TO BE LISTED.
))BYPASS('INTEGER')
           - THE NUMBER OF RECORDS TO SKIP BEFORE PRINTING.
))MAX('INTEGER')
           - THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF RECORDS TO BE PRINTED.     .
))NUM      - NUM INDICATES THAT THE RECORDS CONTAIN A SEQUENCE
             FIELD, WHICH WILL APPEAR ON THE LEFT. FOR FIXED LENGTH
             RECORDS, THE FIELD IS IN THE LAST EIGHT COLUMNS. FOR
             VARIABLE LENGTH RECORDS, THE FIELD IS IN THE FIRST
             EIGHT COLUMNS.
))SNUM     - SNUM INDICATES THAT THE SEQUENCE FIELD IS NOT TO
             BE PRINTED.
))NONUM    - NONUM INDICATES THAT THE ENTIRE RECORD IS TO BE
             TREATED AS DATA, WITH NO SEQUENCE FIELDS.
))COL('BEGIN COLUMN':'END COLUMN')
           - A PAIR OF INTEGERS SEPARATED BY A COLON, INDICATING
             THE FIRST AND LAST COLUMN TO BE PRINTED.
))HEX      - INDICATES THE DATA IS TO BE PRINTED IN HEXADECIMAL.
             BLANKS ARE PRINTED AS '<>' INSTEAD OF '40'.
             SEQUENCE NUMBERS REMAIN IN DECIMAL FORMAT.
             THIS KEYWORD MAY BE ABBREVIATED TO 'X'.
))FILE     - INDICATES THE FIRST OPERAND IS A FILENAME (DDNAME)
             INSTEAD OF A DATA SET NAME.  THE FILENAME MUST
             BE CURRENTLY ALLOCATED TO A DATA SET ON DISK.
             THIS MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO LIST A TEMPORARY DATA SET.
))QUICK    - THIS KEYWORD SPEEDS UP THE COMMAND SOMEWHAT BY CAUSING
             THE COMMAND NOT TO SEARCH THE CATALOG TO DETERMINE
             THE TRAILING QUALIFIER OF AN UNQUALIFIED DATA SET NAME.
             FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU HAVE A DATA SET NAMED X.DATA
             YOU CAN LIST IT BY TYPING "QL X" OR "QL X.DATA".
             IN EITHER CASE THE COMMAND WILL SEARCH THE CATALOG
             TO FIND ANY ADDITIONAL TRAILING QUALIFIER. BUT IF
             YOU TYPE "QL X.DATA QUICK" YOU ARE TELLING IT THAT
             YOU HAVE SPECIFIED THE TRAILING QUALIFIER AND IT CAN
             SAVE ITSELF THE TROUBLE OF LOOKING FOR ONE.  IF YOU
             TYPED "QL X Q" (QUICK CAN BE ABBREVIATED Q) YOU WOULD
             BE INFORMED THAT DATA SET X DOES NOT EXIST, EVEN
             THOUGH X.DATA DOES EXIST.  NOTE THAT THE COMMAND MAY
             STILL HAVE TO SEARCH THE CATALOG TO FIND THE VOLUME
             BUT THIS IS A SEPARATE SEARCH FROM THE QUALIFIER SEARCH.
