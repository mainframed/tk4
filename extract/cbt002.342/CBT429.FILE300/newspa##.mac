GENERAL:

    NEWSPACE is a command for easily creating new, moderately
    sized, datasets and libraries.  It was written with beginners
    in mind.  Can be executed from the ISPF/PDF command line, for
    allocating that dataset you suddenly need.  (Larger or more
    complex datasets should be created with the ALLOCATE and
    ATTRIB commands, or with the ISPF/PDF Dataset Utility (Option
    3.2))

INSTALLATION CHECK LIST:

(  )  1.  The following non-IBM macros are used to assemble
          NEWSPACE. If you already have older versions in your
          system, replace them with the ones from this PDS.

            EQ$R     - Register equates.

            LINKBACK - Linkage conventions out.
            LINKSAVE - Linkage conventions in.

(  )  2.  The following macro is documentation for the GTEDAxxx
          macros, above.  It is not used by NEWSPACE, but should
          be copied into your system.

            GTEDADOC - Documentation of GTEDAxxx macros.

      3.  Edit source member NEWSPACE for the following.

          A.  At labels '@DS' and 'DS' are the following values
              for space allocation.  Change them in both places
              as needed.

              (1) UNIT=SYSTSO            Generic unit name.
              (2) VLSER (not defined)    Specific volume serial.
              (3) PRIME=2                Primary space.
              (4) SECND=2                Secondary space.
              (5) DIR=10                 Directory blocks.

          B.  At label 'DATATBLE' is a variable format list of
              attributes for various data types.  The comments in
              the code explain how to construct new entries.  Add
              new data types to meet your installation needs.

          C.  If you add a new data type into 'DATATBLE', you
              must make a corresponding entry in the list of
              IKJNAME macros following the IKJKEYWD macro at
              label 'TYPE'.  The 'DEFAULT' type must be the last
              entry in the list.  The relative number of entries
              in the list must correspond to the hexidecimal
              sequence number in the first byte of the type entry
              you made in 'DATATBLE'.

          D.  Change the HELP document in member '#NEWSPAC' of
              this dataset.  Then execute the following TSO
              commands to reset the alias:

                  DELETE  pdsname(#NEW)  ALIAS
                  RENAME  pdsname(#NEWSPAC) pdsname(#NEW)  ALIAS

              where 'pdsname' is the name of this PDS.  Be sure
              to use the keyword 'ALIAS'.

(  )  4.  For a non-SMP install, run the jobstream in member
          NEWJCL of this PDS. Recommended load libraries are:

          A.  SYS1.CMDLIB
          B.  library named on the LNKLST

          Add a JOB card at the top, and edit the last few lines
          to provide the name of the selected load library, HELP
          library, and the name of this PDS.

          The jobstream does the following:

          A.  Assembles NEWSPACE using the source in member
              NEWSPACE of this PDS.

              Note: Access to SYS1.AMODGEN is required because
                    NEWSPACE uses the CVT macro.

          B.  Linkedits NEWSPACE into the selected load library,
              assigning an alias of NEW. Attributes are RENT,
              REUS and REFR.

          C.  IEBCOPYs member #NEWSPAC and alias entry #NEW to the
              selected HELP library, renaming them NEWSPACE and
              NEW.

(  )      For an SMP install, follow your installation's procedures
          for installation of a RENT, REUS, REFR module into
          LPALIB, LINKLIB, CMDLIB, or another library on the
          LNKLST, with the HELP member being installed as a
          ++MAC into HELP or another library in the SYSHELP
          concatenation.   The ++MOD entry should have TALIAS(NEW),
          and the ++MAC entry should have MALIAS(NEW).

(  )  5.  If you select SYS1.LPALIB as your target library, you
          will need to IPL, including 'CLPA' in the response to
          the system parameters prompt.  This will create a new
          LPA, picking up your NEWSPACE and NEW alias in the
          process.

(  )      If you have Dynamic BLDL, and already have a version
          of NEWSPACE installed, you will have to stop and restart
          the Dynamic BLDL table.

(  )      If you have ACF2 and are using command limiting lists,
          and are not already running a version of NEWSPACE, you
          must do either one of the following:

          A.  Turn the ALLCMDS bit on in the LOGONID of selected
              users, and invoke NEWSPACE with the '#' prefix.
              That is, use the alias name #NEW. This limits the
              use of NEWSPACE only to those LOGONIDs with the
              ALLCMDS bit on.  Turn the bit on with the following
              sequence from TSO READY state using a LOGONID with
              appropriate authority to change the bit.

                   ACF
                   LIST logonid
                   CHANGE * ALLCMDS
                   END

          B.  Add the following macro to the command limiting
              list, then assemble, link, and IPL with CLPA.  This
              makes NEWSPACE available to everyone.

                   $TSOCMD  (NEWSPACE,NEW)
