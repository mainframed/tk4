   EXECUTION OF THE ASMG PROMPTER.
))OBJECT('DSNAME')  SPECIFIES THAT THE ASSEMBLER IS TO  PRODUCE
   AN OBJECT MODULE. IF ('DSNAME') IS PRESENT, IT SPECIFIES THE
   DATA SET TO CONTAIN THE OBJECT MODULE. OTHERWISE A STANDARD
   DATA SET IS USED.

   WITH A DISPOSITION OF MOD.
))NOOBJECT  SPECIFIES THAT THE ASSEMBLER IS NOT TO PRODUCE AN
   OBJECT MODULE.
))PRINT('DSNAME')  SPECIFIES THAT THE ASSEMBLY LISTING IS TO BE PLACED
   IN THE DATA SET SPECIFIED BY 'DSNAME'. IF ('DSNAME') IS OMITTED,
   A STANDARD DATA SET WILL BE USED.

   IS NOT SPECIFIED, THE ASSEMBLY LISTING WILL BE PLACED IN A SYSOUT (A)
   DATA SET.
))SYSOUT  SPECIFIES THAT THE ASSEMBLY LISTING IS TO BE PLACED IN A
   SYSOUT (A) DATA SET.

   LIST IS EXPLICITLY SPECIFIED, THE ASSEMBLY LISTING WILL BE PLACED IN
   A SYSOUT (A) DATA SET.
))NOLIST  SPECIFIES THAT NO ASSEMBLY LISTING IS TO BE PRODUCED. IF
   PRINT OR SYSOUT IS EXPLICITLY SPECIFIED, IT IS IGNORED.
))LIB('KWDLIST')  SPECIFIES A LIST OF LIBRARY DATA SETS TO BE USED BY
   THE ASSEMBLER FOR MACRO DEFINITIONS. IF MACLIB IS IN EFFECT (EITHER
   EXPLICITLY SPECIFIED OR BY DEFAULT) SYS1.MACLIB AND SYS2.MACLIB
   WILL BE CONCATENATED TO THE DATA SETS SPECIFIED BY ('KWDLIST'). A
   MAXIMUM OF FIVE DIFFERENT DATA SETS SPECIFIED BY ('KWDLIST') WILL BE
   ACCEPTED BY THE PROMPTER.
))MACLIB  SPECIFIES THAT SYS1.MACLIB AND SYS2.MACLIB ARE TO BE USED BY
   THE ASSEMBLER FOR MACRO DEFINITIONS. SYS1.MACLIB AND SYS2.MACLIB
   WILL BE CONCATENATED TO THE DATA SETS SPECIFIED BY THE LIB OPTION.
))NOMACLIB  SPECIFIES THAT SYS1.MACLIB AND SYS2.MACLIB ARE NOT TO BE
   USED TO OBTAIN MACRO DEFINITIONS. IF LIB('DSNAME') IS NOT SPECIFIED,
   THE SYSLIB DATA SET CAN BE ALLOCATED PRIOR TO INVOKING THE
   PROMPTER.
))TEST  SPECIFIES A SYMBOL TABLE IS TO BE GENERATED WITH THE OBJECT
   MODULE FOR USE WITH THE TEST COMMAND.
))NOTEST  SPECIFIES NO SYMBOL TABLE IS TO BE GENERATED WITH THE
   OBJECT MODULE.
))ALIGN  SPECIFIES THAT ALIGNMENT OF DATA IS TO BE DONE ABOVE
   MINIMUM HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS.
))NOALIGN  SPECIFIES THAT OPERANDS AND DATA ARE ONLY TO BE
   CHECKED FOR BOUNDARY CONSTRAINTS MADE MANDATORY BY HARDWARE.
))RENT  SPECIFIES THAT THE ASSEMBLER IS TO CHECK FOR POSSIBLE
   CODING VIOLATIONS OF REENTERABILITY.
))NORENT  SPECIFIES THAT NO CHECK IS TO BE MADE BY THE ASSEMBLER
   FOR POSSIBLE CODING VIOLATIONS OF REENTERABILITY.
))ESD  SPECIFIES THAT THE ASSEMBLER IS TO PRODUCE AN EXTERNAL SYMBOL
   DICTIONARY AS PART OF THE ASSEMBLER LISTING.
   ESD IS IGNORED IF NOPRINT AND/OR NOLIST IS IN EFFECT.
))NOESD  SPECIFIES THAT THE ASSEMBLER IS NOT TO PRODUCE THE EXTERNAL
   SYMBOL DICTIONARY.
))RLD  SPECIFIES THAT THE ASSEMBLER IS TO PRODUCE THE RELOCATION
   DICTIONARY AS PART OF THE ASSEMBLER LISTING.
))NORLD  SPECIFIES THAT THE ASSEMBLER IS NOT TO LIST THE
   RELOCATION DICTIONARY.
))XREF  SPECIFIES THAT A CONDENCED CROSS-REFERENCE OF ALL
   THE SYMBOLS USED IN THE PROGRAM IS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE OUTPUT
   ASSEMBLY LISTING.
))FULLXREF  SPECIFIES THAT A FULL CROSS-REFERENCE OF
   ALL THE SYMBOLS USED IN THE PROGRAM IS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE
   OUTPUT ASSEMBLY LISTING.
))NOXREF  SPECIFIES THAT NO SYMBOL CROSS-REFERENCE TABLE IS TO BE
   GENERATED AS PART OF THE ASSEMBLY.
))LREF  SPECIFIES THAT A CROSS-REFERENCE OF THE LITERALS USED IN THE
   PROGRAM IS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE OUTPUT ASSEMBLY LISTING.
))NOLREF  SPECIFIES THAT THAT NO CROSS-REFERENCE OF THE LITERALS USED
   PROGRAM IS TO BE PRODUCED.
))LINECOUNT('INTEGER')  SPECIFIES THE NUMBER OF  LINES PER PAGE
   IN THE LISTING DATA SET.
))TERMINAL  SPECIFIES THAT ANY ERROR DIAGNOSTICS GENERATED BY  THE
   ASSEMBLER ARE TO BE PRINTED AT THE TERMINAL.
   NOTE - THE FOLLOWING OPTIONS ARE IGNORED IF NOTERM IS SPECIFIED -
          NUMBER, STMT, NONUMBER, AND NOSTMT.
))NOTERMINAL  SPECIFIES THAT NO DIAGNOSTIC MESSAGES ARE TO BE PRINTED
   AT THE TERMINAL.
))NUMBER  SPECIFIES THAT THE LINE NUMBER FIELD (COL 73-80) IS TO BE
   OUTPUT ALONG WITH THE STATEMENT FOR WHICH DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION
   IS GIVEN.
))NONUMBER  SPECIFIES THAT THE LINE NUMBER FIELD IS NOT TO BE
   OUTPUT.
))STMT  SPECIFIES THAT THE ASSEMBLER GENERATED STATEMENT NUMBER IS TO
   BE OUTPUT ALONG WITH THE STATEMENT FOR WHICH DIAGNOSTIC INFORMATION
   IS GIVEN.
))NOSTMT  SPECIFIES THAT THE ASSEMBLER GENERATED STATEMENT NUMBER IS
   NOT TO BE OUTPUT.
))BATCH  SPECIFIES THAT THE ASSEMBLER IS TO PROCESS BATCHED INPUT.

   THE FIELD, IF NEEDED, BEFORE THIS STRING IS MOVED IN. THE TOTAL
   NUMBER OF CHARACTERS IN THE PARM FIELD MAY NOT EXCEED 256. THE
   PROMPTER DOES NOT TEST FOR LEGITIMATE ASSEMBLER OPTIONS IN THE
   STRING. IF AN ASSEMBLER OPTION APPEARS MORE THAN ONCE IN THE PARM
   FIELD, THE LAST OCCURRENCE TAKES PRECEDENCE.
))NOOPTION  SPECIFIES THAT THERE IS NO STRING TO BE PASSED TO THE
   ASSEMBLER VIA THE PARM FIELD.
