)F   FUNCTION -
         THE ASM COMMAND PROVIDES AN INTERFACE BETWEEN TSO AND THE
         IBM MVS ASSEMBLER TO ALLOW ASSEMBLIES TO BE PERFORMED
         FROM A TSO TERMINAL.

         THE ASM COMMAND ALLOWS USERS TO SPECIFY THE INPUT DATA
         SETS TO BE ASSEMBLED, THE DATA SET WHICH IS TO CONTAIN
         THE OBJECT MODULE FROM THE ASSEMBLY, THE MACRO LIBRARY
         DATA SETS TO BE USED BY THE ASSEMBLER, AND AN OPTIONAL
         DATA SET TO CONTAIN THE ASSEMBLY LISTING.
