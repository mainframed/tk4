                  INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR JCLSCAN


JCLSCAN IS A TSO COMMAND PROCESSOR WHICH EXECUTES THE IBM JCL CONVERTER
  IN THE FOREGROUND.  YOU POINT IT TO A DATASET OF JCL (A JOB) AND
  IT RETURNS YOUR JCL ERRORS TO THE TERMINAL AS THOUGH IT WERE EXECUTED
  WITH TYPRUN=SCAN.  THIS IS ESPECIALLY VALUABLE WHEN MAKING NEW JCL.
  YOU CAN TEST THE JCL WITHOUT USING AN INITIATOR.  THE CONVERTER RUNS
  COMPLETELY IN THE FOREGROUND.

THE JCLSCAN PROCESSOR WORKS WITH AN SVC WHICH ACTUALLY CALLS THE JCL
  CONVERTER.  OUTPUT FROM THE CONVERTER IS RETURNED TO THE COMMAND
  PROCESSOR, WHICH FORMATS IT FOR THE SCREEN.

HELP INFORMATION FOR THE TSO COMMAND JCLSCAN IS INCLUDED IN THE SOURCE
  CODE.  COPY THAT INFORMATION INTO A TSO HELP DATASET AND EDIT IT
  SO IT FITS THE HELP FORMAT.

TO INSTALL :

   A.  ASSEMBLE THE JCLSCAN COMMAND AND THE SVC INTO AN AUTHORIZED
         LOAD LIBRARY.  (PICK AN UNUSED TYPE 3 OR TYPE 4 SVC NUMBER.)
         MEMBER NAME IN THE FILE IS JCLSC23F (REAL NAME IGC0023F)

   B.  IF YOU HAVE MODREP OR THE EQUIVALENT (TO MLPA THE SVC
         DYNAMICALLY) THEN MLPA THE SVC FOR TESTING.  MODREP IS ON
         JIM MARSHALL'S FILE 316 OF THE CBT TAPE OR RICE UNIVERSITY
         FILE 336.  WHEN IT WORKS TO YOUR SATISFACTION, COPY THE SVC
         INTO SYS1.LPALIB AND IPL MVS WITH CLPA.

   NOTE: MODREP IN FILE 316 DOES NOT WORK ON MVS/XA TO MY KNOWLEDGE.
         SO YOU CAN DO A REAL MLPA TO GET THE SVC IN.
         JIM MARSHALL
