GENERAL:

    The SYSDSN command makes a list of all JOBs, TSO users, and
    started tasks which are using a dataset, or waiting to use
    it.  If you receive a message that a dataset has not been
    allocated because it is in use by another task or user, the
    SYSDSN command can be used to determine who the other task or
    user is.  SYSDSN is also useful when an operator receives a
    message that a job is waiting for datasets.

DIRECTORY:

    This PDS contains the following members relating to SYSDSN:

    SYSDDOC  - This documentation.
    SYSDJCL  - Non-SMP install jobstream.
    #SYSDSN  - HELP member.
    #SYSD    - Alias for HELP member.  Needed for IEBCOPY in
               the non-SMP install.
    SYSDCPY  - IEBCOPY control cards.  Used in non-SMP install.
    SYSDLNK  - LKED control cards.  Used in non-SMP install.
    SYSDSN   - Source program.


INSTALLATION CHECK LIST:

(  )  1.  For a non-SMP install, run the jobstream in member
          SYSDJCL of this PDS. Recommended load libraries are:

          A.  SYS1.CMDLIB
          B.  library named on the LNKLST

          Add a JOB card at the top, and edit the last few lines
          to provide the name of the selected load library, HELP
          library, and the name of this PDS.

          The jobstream does the following:

          A.  Assembles SYSDSN using the source in member
              SYSDSN of this PDS.

              Note: Access to SYS1.AMODGEN is required because
                    SYSDSN uses the CVT macro.

          B.  Linkedits SYSDSN into the selected load library,
              assigning an alias of SYSD. Attributes are RENT,
              REUS and REFR.

          C.  IEBCOPYs member #SYSDSN and alias entry #SYSD to the
              selected HELP library, renaming them SYSDSN and
              SYSD.

(  )      For an SMP install, follow your installation's procedures
          for installation of a RENT, REUS, REFR module into
          LPALIB, LINKLIB, CMDLIB, or another library on the
          LNKLST, with the HELP member being installed as a
          ++MAC into HELP or another library in the SYSHELP
          concatenation.   The ++MOD entry should have TALIAS(SYSD),
          and the ++MAC entry should have MALIAS(SYSD).

(  )  2.  If you select SYS1.LPALIB as your target library, you
          will need to IPL, including 'CLPA' in the response to
          the system parameters prompt.  This will create a new
          LPA, picking up your SYSDSN and SYSD alias in the
          process.

(  )      If you have Dynamic BLDL, and already have a version
          of SYSDSN installed, you will have to stop and restart
          the Dynamic BLDL table.

(  )      If you have ACF2 and are using command limiting lists,
          and are not already running a version of SYSDSN, you
          must do either one of the following:

          A.  Turn the ALLCMDS bit on in the LOGONID of selected
              users, and invoke SYSDSN with the '#' prefix.
              That is, use the name #SYSDSN or alias #SYSD. This
              limits the use of SYSDSN only to those LOGONIDs
              with the ALLCMDS bit on.  Turn the bit on with the
              following sequence from TSO READY state using a
              LOGONID with appropriate authority to change the
              bit.

                   ACF
                   LIST logonid
                   CHANGE * ALLCMDS
                   END

          B.  Add the following macro to the command limiting
              list, then assemble, link, and IPL with CLPA.  This
              makes SYSDSN available to everyone.

                   $TSOCMD  (SYSDSN,SYSD)
