=PUT
)F FUNCTION -
  THE PUT SUBCOMMAND IS USED TO INSERT A STRING INTO ONE OR MORE
  EXISTING LINES AT A SPECIFIED COLUMN OR COLUMN RANGE.
)X SYNTAX -
         PUT LINERANGE STRING OPERATOR DESTINATION INCR/DECR('N')

  REQUIRED - STRING, DESTINATION
  DEFAULTS - LINERANGE DEFAULTS TO * .
           - OPERATOR DEFAULTS TO 'OVER' WHEN DEST IS ONE COLUMN,
             AND DEFAULTS TO 'ON' WHEN DEST IS A RANGE OF COLUMNS.
  ALIAS    - NONE
  EXAMPLES - PUT /X/ 72         WILL OVERLAY COLUMN 72 WITH AN 'X'.
             PUT /XY/ 30        WILL OVERLAY COLUMNS 30:31 WITH 'XY'.
             PUT /XY/ 30:71     WILL OVERLAY COLUMNS 30:31 WITH 'XY'
                                AND OVERLAY COLUMNS 32:71 WITH BLANKS.
             PUT /XY/ IN 30:71  WILL REPLACE COLUMNS 30:71 WITH 'XY',
                                SHIFTING COLUMN 72 OVER TO 32.
             PUT /XY/ AT 30     WILL SHIFT COLUMNS 30 AND BEYOND
                                TWO COLUMNS RIGHT AND INSERT 'XY'
                                IN COLUMNS 30:31.
)O OPERANDS -
  LINERANGE
           - * FOR THE CURRENT LINE. * 'COUNT1' OR 'LINENUM1,LINENUM2'
             FOR A RANGE OF LINES. 'LINENUM' FOR A PARTICULAR LINE.
  STRING
           - REPRESENTS THE REPLACEMENT STRING TO BE MOVED INTO THE
             LINE(S). IT IS SURROUNDED WITH DELIMITERS, LIKE
             A STRING IN THE 'FIND' SUBCOMMAND.
  OPERATOR
           - VALID OPERATORS ARE: AT, IN, ON, OVER.
             OPERATORS THAT BEGIN WITH THE LETTER 'O' NEVER CAUSE
             EXISTING DATA TO BE SHIFTED TO DIFFERENT COLUMNS, BUT
             SIMPLY OVERLAY EXISTING DATA.  OTHER OPERATORS CAN
             CAUSE EXISTING DATA TO BE SHIFTED TO NEW POSITIONS.
             AT - FOR INSERTING DATA BETWEEN ADJACENT COLUMNS.
                  THE DESTINATION MAY NOT BE A RANGE.
             IN - FOR REPLACING THE CONTENTS OF THE DESTINATION
                  AND, IF THE LENGTHS ARE UNEQUAL, SHIFTING
                  SUBSEQUENT COLUMNS OVER. IF THE STRING IS NULL
                  THE DESTINATION COLUMNS ARE DELETED.
             ON - FOR REPLACING THE CONTENTS OF THE DESTINATION
                  AND, IF THE LENGTHS ARE UNEQUAL, PADDING WITH BLANKS.
             OVER - FOR OVERLAYING AS MANY COLUMNS AS THE LENGTH OF
                  THE STRING REQUIRES, STARTING AT THE DESTINATION
                  COLUMN. DESTINATION MAY NOT BE A RANGE.
  DESTINATION
           - DESCRIBES THE DESTINATION OF THE DATA TO BE MOVED. IT HAS
             TWO FORMS, A COLUMN NUMBER OR A COLUMN RANGE: N, N:N .
))INCR('N') - WHEN THE STRING IS ALL-NUMERIC, THIS
              IS THE NUMBER TO BE ADDED TO THAT STRING.
