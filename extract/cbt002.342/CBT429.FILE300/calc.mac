         TITLE 'TSO CALCULATOR PROGRAM DRIVER'
*-------------------------------------------------------------------*
*        THIS PROGRAM IS USED TO CALL THE TSO CALCULATOR PROGRAM.   *
*        WROTE IT BECAUSE WHEN THE CALC PROGRAM WAS EXECUTED LIKE A *
*        TSO COMMAND PROCESSOR AND A NASTY MESSAGE WAS PRODUCED     *
*        ( IBM003I ). IT DID NOT HURT BUT IT LOOKED AWFUL, DIRTY,   *
*        AND MADE THE USERS BELIEVE SOMETHING WAS WRONG. THIS IS    *
*        THE WAY TO CIRCUMVENT THE MSG.       JIM MARSHALL          *
