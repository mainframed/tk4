)F THE TSO FORT PROMPTER INVOKES THE FORTRAN IV (G1) COMPILER.

   NOTES: 1)  OBJECT (OR LOAD) MAY BE FOLLOWED BY- ('DSNAME').
          2)  PRINT MAY BE FOLLOWED BY- ('DSNAME') OR (*).
          3)  PFILE MAY BE FOLLOWED BY- ('DDNAME')
          4)  NOPRINT ALLOCATES SYSPRINT AS DD DUMMY.
          5)  A MESSAGE CONTAINING THE RETURN CODE IS PRINTED AT THE
              USER'S TERMINAL IF THE RETURN CODE IS GREATER THAN 0.

   REQUIRED- 'DSLIST'

)O 'DSLIST'  NAME(S) OF THE FORTRAN LANGUAGE SOURCE DATA SET(S) TO BE
   COMPILED.  A MAXIMUM OF TEN DATA SETS MAY BE COMPILED IN ONE RUN.
))OBJECT('DSNAME')  SPECIFIES THAT THE COMPILER IS TO  PRODUCE
   AN OBJECT MODULE.  IF 'DSNAME' IS PRESENT, IT SPECIFIES THE
   DATA SET TO CONTAIN THE OBJECT MODULE; OTHERWISE A STANDARD
   DATA SET IS USED.
))NOOBJECT  SPECIFIES THAT THE COMPILER IS NOT TO PRODUCE AN
   OBJECT MODULE.
))PRINT('DSNAME')  SPECIFIES THAT THE FORTRAN LISTING IS TO BE PLACED
   IN THE DATA SET SPECIFIED BY 'DSNAME'.  IF 'DSNAME' IS OMITTED,
   A DATA SET WITH A QUALIFIER OF 'LIST' WILL BE CREATED/REUSED.
   PRINT(*) WILL ALLOCATE SYSPRINT TO THE TERMINAL.
))SYSOUT  SPECIFIES THAT THE FORTRAN LISTING IS TO BE PLACED IN A
   SYSOUT (A) DATA SET.
))NOPRINT  ALL SYSPRINT OUTPUT IS SUPPRESSED.  THIS IS THE DEFAULT.
))SOURCE  SPECIFIES THAT A SOURCE LISTING IS TO BE PRODUCED.
))NOSOURCE  SPECIFIES THAT THE SOURCE LISTING IS NOT TO BE PRODUCED.
))BCD  SPECIFIES THAT SOURCE INPUT IS TO BE TREATED AS HAVING
   BCD CHARACTERS.  THE DEFAULT IS EBCDIC.
))EBCDIC  SPECIFIES THAT SOURCE INPUT IS TO BE TREATED AS HAVING
   EBCDIC OR BCD CHARACTERS.
))LIST  SPECIFIES THAT THE COMPILER IS TO PRODUCE AN ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE
   LISTING OF THE GENERATED CODE.  THE DEFAULT IS NOLIST.
))NOLIST  SPECIFIES THAT THE COMPILER IS NOT TO GENERATE AN ASSEMBLY
   LANGUAGE LISTING OF THE GENERATED CODE.
))MAP  SPECIFIES THAT THE COMPILER IS TO GENERATE A MAP OF VARIABLES
   AND STATEMENT NUMBERS.
))NOMAP  SPECIFIES THAT THE COMPILER IS NOT TO GENERATE A MAP OF
   VARIABLES OR STATEMENT NUMBERS.  THE DEFAULT IS MAP.
))ID  SPECIFIES THAT THE COMPILER IS TO GENERATE CODE CONTAINING THE
   INTERNAL STATEMENT NUMBERS (ISN) FOR CALLING SEQUENCES TO SUB-
   ROUTINES FOR A TRACEBACK MAP.
))NOID  SPECIFIES THAT THE COMPILER IS NOT TO GENERATE CODE CONTAINING
   INTERNAL STATEMENT NUMBERS.  THE DEFAULT IS GOSTMT.
))NAME('STRING')  SPECIFIES THE NAME TO BE GIVEN TO THE MAIN SOURCE
   PROGRAM.  THE NAME MAY BE FROM ONE TO SIX CHARACTERS.  THE DEFAULT
   NAME IS MAIN.
))LINECOUNT('INTEGER')  SPECIFIES THE NUMBER OF LINES PER PRINTED PAGE
   OF OUTPUT.  THE DEFAULT VALUE IS 78.
))TERMINAL  SPECIFIES THAT THE SYSTERM OUTPUT IS TO BE PLACED IN THE
   DATA SET SPECIFIED BY 'DSNAME'.  IF 'DSNAME' IS OMITTED, THE
   ERROR MESSAGES AND ASSOCIATED SOURCE IS SENT TO THE USER'S TERMINAL.
))NOTERMINAL  SPECIFIES THAT NO DIAGNOSTIC MESSAGES ARE TO BE PRINTED
   AT THE TERMINAL.  THE DEFAULT IS TERM.
))MSG  SPECIFIES THAT DATA SET NAMES ARE TO BE DISPLAYED.
   THE NAME OF THE DATA SET TO CONTAIN THE OBJECT MODULE, AND
   THE NAME OF THE DATA SET TO CONTAIN THE FORTRAN LISTING (IF ANY).
))NOMSG  SPECIFIES THAT NO MESSAGES ARE TO BE PRINTED.  THE DEFAULT
   IS MSG.
