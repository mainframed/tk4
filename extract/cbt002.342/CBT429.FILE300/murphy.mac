*        'MURPHY'  THE OLE PHILOSOPHER              18 AUGUST 1988    *
*                                                                     *
*        MURPHY WAS FOUND ON A JES2 TAPE OF ALL PLACES WITH ABOUT     *
*        500 OR SO SAYINGS. GOT ANOTHER 250 FROM AN UNKNOWN SOURCE    *
*        AND HAVE ADDED ABOUT 100 OR SO MYSELF.                       *
*                                                                     *
*        MADE ALOT OF CHANGES IN THE CODE:                            *
*                                                                     *
*        1. REWROTE THE CODE TO MAKE IT MORE STRAIGHT-FORWARD.        *
*                                                                     *
*        2. TOOK OUT THE USE OF HOUSE-KEEPING MACROS; THEY ALWAYS     *
*           SEEM TO BE DOING SOMETHING UNNATURAL. I PREFER TO SEE     *
*           HOW THINGS ARE SETUP.                                     *
*                                                                     *
*        3. MADE CODE RE-ENTRANT, SEEMED LIKE THE RIGHT THING TO DO.  *
*                                                                     *
*        4. TOOK OUT SOME OF THE OFFENSIVE SAYINGS; LIKE REFERENCE    *
*           TO BLIND PEOPLE, ETC. NOT TASTEFUL AT ALL.                *
*                                                                     *
*        5. CHANGED STANDARD LINE LENGTH FROM 75 TO 59, SAVED A WHOLE *
*           BUNCH OF MEMORY.                                          *
*                                                                     *
*        6. CORRECTED, SPELLING, AND GRAMMATICAL ERRORS. ENJOY !!!    *
*                                                                     *
*                                                                     *
*        JIM MARSHALL, CAPT, USAF                                     *
*        (301) 688-6829                                               *
*                                                                     *
*        7. Removed some of the more obscure and unfunny-when-out-    *
*           of-context sayings, replaced them with 'better' ones,     *
*           and added more.                                           *
*                                                                     *
*        8. Created the DD macro to define the sayings and build a    *
*           length field.  Used the length field in the TPUT macro    *
*           to be able to write variable-length text.                 *
*                                                                     *
*        9. Got rid of the unneeded multiple base registers.          *
*                                                                     *
