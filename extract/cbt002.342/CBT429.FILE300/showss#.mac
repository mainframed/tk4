)F FUNCTION -
  THE SHOWSS COMMAND DISPLAYS INFORMATION ABOUT THE SUBSYSTEMS
  IN THE SUBSYSTEM NAME TABLE.

  FOR EACH SUBSYSTEM, THE ADDRESS OF THE SSCT AND THE SSVT
  ARE DISPLAYED.  IF THE SSVT ADDRESS IS ZERO, THE WORD "DORMANT"
  IS DISPLAYED.

  WITHOUT ZEROING ITS SSVT ADDRESS AND CANNOT BE STARTED AGAIN
  BECAUSE IT THINKS IT IS STILL ACTIVE.
