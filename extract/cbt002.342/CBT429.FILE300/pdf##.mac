GENERAL:


  The PDF Command is used to preallocate the ISPF profile dataset,
  then bring the user into ISPF/PDF.  PDF is a frontend which uses
  the ISRPCP entrypoint of ISPF/PDF, enabling the user to select
  optional panel numbers when invoking the product.

  ISPFPROF is an alias of the PDF command.  When using this alias,
  the profile dataset will be allocated, but the program will not
  enter ISPF/PDF.

  Syntax -

  ×  NOTE  ×
  +--------+
        ISPFPROF is an alias of the PDF command processor.  But
        ISPFPROF is ** NOT ** an alias of the HELP member.  There
        are two help members, ISPFPROF and PDF.

INSTALLATION CHECK LIST:

(  )  1.  The following non-IBM macros are used to assemble
          PDF. If you already have older versions in your
          system, replace them with the ones from this PDS.

            EQ$R     - Register equates.
            GTEDAALC - Execute SVC99 and IKJEFF18 (DAIRFAIL).
            GTEDADAT - Create SVC99/IKJEFF18 control blocks.
            GTEDASET - Link SVC99/IKJEFF18 control blocks together.
            LINKBACK - Linkage conventions out.
            LINKSAVE - Linkage conventions in.

(  )  2.  The following macro is documentation for the GTEDAxxx
          macros, above.  It is not used by PDF, but should
          be copied into your system.

            GTEDADOC - Documentation of GTEDAxxx macros.

(  )  3.  Edit source member PDF.  At labels '@NE' and 'NEW'
          are macros containing UNIT=SYSTSO for allocation of
          the profile dataset.  Change this to match your
          installation's generic unit name.  Make the change
          at both labels.

          A specific volume serial number can be designated by
          including VLSER=xxxxxx in both macros, where xxxxxx
          is the selected serial number.

(  )  4.  Remove aliases 'SPF', 'PDF', and 'ISPFPROF' if they
          exist for module ISRPCP.  The module is probably in
          SYS1.LPALIB.  If the module was installed with SMP,
          follow your installation standards for removing the
          aliases.  The following TSO commands would remove the
          aliases without SMP.  If the module is in LPALIB,
          an IPL with CLPA will be required.

              DELETE 'SYS1.LPALIB(SPF)' ALIAS
              DELETE 'SYS1.LPALIB(PDF)' ALIAS
              DELETE 'SYS1.LPALIB(ISPFPROF)' ALIAS

(  )  5.  For a non-SMP install, run the jobstream in member
          PDFJCL of this PDS. Recommended load libraries are:

          A.  SYS1.LPALIB
          B.  SYS1.LINKLIB
          C.  SYS1.CMDLIB
          D.  library named on the LNKLST

          Add a JOB card at the top, and edit the last few lines
          to provide the name of the selected load library, HELP
          library, and the name of this PDS.

          The jobstream does the following:

          A.  Assembles PDF using the source in member PDF of
              this PDS.

          B.  Linkedits PDF into the selected load library,
              assigning aliases of SPF and ISPFPROF.  Attributes
              are RENT, REUS and REFR.

          C.  IEBCOPYs members #PDF and #ISPFPRO to the selected
              HELP library, renaming them PDF and ISPFPROF.
              #ISPFPRO is not an alias of #PDF.

(  )      For an SMP install, follow your installation's
          procedures for installation of a RENT, REUS, REFR
          module into LPALIB, LINKLIB, CMDLIB, or another library
          on the LNKLST, with the HELP member being installed as
          a ++MAC into HELP or another library in the SYSHELP
          concatenation.   The ++MOD entry should have
          TALIAS(ISPFPROF,SPF), and the ++MAC entry should have
          MALIAS(ISPFPROF).

(  )  5.  If you select SYS1.LPALIB as your target library, you
          will need to IPL, including 'CLPA' in the response to
          the system parameters prompt.  This will create a new
          LPA, picking up your PDF, ISPFPROF, and SPF names in
          the process.

(  )      If you have Dynamic BLDL, and already have a version
          of PDF installed, you will have to stop and restart
          the Dynamic BLDL table.

(  )      If you have ACF2, the following addition needs to be
          made to the ACF99@RB macro in order to be able to use
          datasets for which rules exist.  Refer to the ACF2
          System Programmer's Guide for more information about
          program pathing and updating the ACF99@RB macro.

(  )      If you have ACF2 and are using command limiting lists,
          and are not already running a version of PDF, you
          must do either one of the following:

          A.  Turn the ALLCMDS bit on in the LOGONID of selected
              users, and invoke PDF with the '#' prefix.
              That is, use the name #PDF or alias #SPF. This
              limits the use of PDF only to those LOGONIDs
              with the ALLCMDS bit on.  Turn the bit on with the
              following sequence from TSO READY state using a
              LOGONID with appropriate authority to change the
              bit.

                   ACF
                   LIST logonid
                   CHANGE * ALLCMDS
                   END

          B.  Add the following macro to the command limiting
              list, then assemble, link, and IPL with CLPA.  This
              makes PDF available to everyone.

                   $TSOCMD  (PDF,ISPFPROF,SPF)
