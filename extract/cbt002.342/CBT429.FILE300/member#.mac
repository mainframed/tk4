))ESOTERIC - FOR LOAD MODULES, A SECOND LINE OF DIRECTORY
             INFORMATION, WHICH IS RARELY OF INTEREST, IS TO
             BE DISPLAYED.
))LIST     - FOR LOAD MODULES, THE FIRST 48 BYTES OF THE
             TEXT WILL BE DISPLAYED.  USEFUL IF THE PROGRAM
             HAD IDENTIFYING INFORMATION SUCH AS DATE-ASSEMBLED
             IN ITS 'SAVE' MACRO.  NOT VALID WITH 'SYS'.
))MAP      - FOR LOAD MODULES, THE CSECT NAMES FROM THE CESD
             RECORD(S) WILL BE DISPLAYED.  NOT VALID WITH 'SYS'.
))IDR      - FOR LOAD MODULES, THE IDR RECORD CONTAINING THE
             DATE OF LINKEDIT IS DISPLAYED.
             IF IDR(ZAP) IS SPECIFIED, IDR ZAP RECORDS ARE DISPLAYED.
             IF IDR(TRAN) IS SPECIFIED, IDR TRANSLATOR RECORDS, CON-
             TAINING THE DATE OF ASSEMBLY OR COMPILATION, ARE DISPLAYED.
             IDR(PLS) IS THE SAME AS IDR(TRANS), EXCEPT PLS TRANSLATOR
             INFORMATION IS ALSO DISPLAYED.

             BY THE LINKEDIT 'IDENTIFY' STATEMENT, ARE DISPLAYED.
             IF IDR(SPACE) IS SPECIFIED, THE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE
             SLOTS FOR ZAP ENTRIES IS DISPLAYED.
             IF IDR(ALL) IS SPECIFIED, ALL IDR RECORDS ARE DISPLAYED,
             BUT NOT THE ZAP SPACE AVAILABLE.  USE IDR(ALL SPACE).

             'MAP' AND 'IDR' INFORMATION WILL BE RESTRICTED TO
             THE SPECIFIED CSECT.
))SYS      - THE 'SYS' KEYWORD INDICATES THAT THE FIRST
             OPERAND IS A MEMBER NAME AND THE SYSTEM LINK LIBRARIES
             (OR SESSION STEPLIB) ARE TO BE SEARCHED FOR IT.
             THIS OPERAND CANCELS THE 'LIST', 'MAP' AND 'IDR' OPERANDS,
             WHICH REQUIRE A DATA SET NAME IN THE 1ST OPERAND.
))WHERE    - VALID ONLY WITH 'SYS', THIS CAUSES THE CONCATENATION
