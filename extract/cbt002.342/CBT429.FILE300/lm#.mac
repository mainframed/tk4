)F FUNCTION -

  THE  LM  COMMAND IS USED TO PRINT OUT PART OR ALL OF THE DIRECTORY OF
  OF A PDS.  OPTIONALLY, IT WILL PRODUCE A DISK DATA SET SUITABLE FOR
  MANIPULATION WITH EDIT.  LM  GENERATES A RETURN CODE OF ZERO IF
  SUCCESSFUL  SHOULD NO MEMBERS MEET THE REQUIREMENTS FOR LISTING (SEE
  MASK PARAMETER) A RETURN CODE OF 4 IS RETURNED. THE FOLLOWING
  RETURN CODES INDICATE UNSUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF LM.

      08 - OUTPUT INCOMPLETE OR OUTPUT DATA SET NOT CREATED.
      12 - INPUT DATA SET UNREADABLE OR NOT PARTITIONED.
      16 - PARSE ERROR PROCESSING USER'S PARAMETERS.

    WHENEVER A NON-ZERO RETURN CODE IS GENERATED, AN APPROPRIATE
    MESSAGE WILL BE DISPLAYED AT THE USER'S TERMINAL.

)X SYNTAX  -

         LM  'DSNAME'   LINESIZE('SIZE')    MASK('MASK')
              DA('DSN')  ALIAS/NOALIAS

  REQUIRED - DSNAME
  DEFAULTS - LINESIZE=7    MASK=ALL        ALIAS
  ALIAS    - SHOWDIR

)O OPERANDS -
   'DSNAME'         - THE PARTITIONED DATA SET FOR WHICH THE DIRECTORY
                      LISTING IS REQUIRED.

))LINESIZE('SIZE') - THE NUMBER OF MEMBER NAMES TO BE DISPLAYED
                      ON A SINGLE LINE. MAXIMUM IS 9.
                      IF THE 'DA' OPTION IS TAKEN, THE FIRST
                      MEMBER NAME ON EACH LINE WILL BEGIN IN
                      POSITION 1.

))MASK('MASK')   - AN OPTIONAL MASK OR PREFIX  USED AS A SEARCH MASK.
               UP TO EIGHT CHARACTERS ON WHICH TO COMPARE
               FOR EQUAL BEFORE PRINTING. AN ASTERISK (*), IN ANY
               POSITION MAKES IT A NON-COMPARE POSITION.
               EXAMPLES:

                    MASK(BPS)    WILL RETURN ANY MEMBER NAME
                                   THAT BEGINS WITH 'BPS'.

                    PRE(*****XYS)  WILL RETURN ANY MEMBER NAME THAT
                                   ENDS IN 'XYZ' IN COLUMNS 6-8.

                    M(BPS****7)   WILL RETURN ANY MEMBER NAME THAT
                                   BEGINS 'BPS' AND ENDS IN A '7'.

))PREFIX('MASK')    - SAME AS MASK PARAMETER

))DA('DSN')      WILL RETURN THE LIST OF MEMBER NAMES IN
               A SEQUENTIAL DATA SET NAMED, 'USERID.(DSN).DATA'.
               A DSNAME IN QUOTES WILL BE RESPECTED, AS WILL A VALID
               QUALIFIER (ASM,CLIST,CNTL,COBOL,DATA,FORT,PLI OR SPIT).
               THE DATA SET WILL HAVE SEQUENCE NUMBERS IN EDIT FORMAT.
               NOTE - DA(*) WILL BE TREATED AS IF THE DA
               PARAMETER WAS NOT ENTERED AT ALL (OUTPUT WILL GO TO
               THE USER'S TERMINAL).

))DS('DSN')   SAME AS DA PARAMETER

))ALIAS/NOALIAS    - 'NOALIAS' WILL SUPPRESS THE SPECIAL FORMATTING
               GIVEN TO ALIAS NAMES. 'ALIAS' IS THE DEFAULT.
               NOTE -- AN '*ORPHAN*' IS AN ALIAS NAME THAT
               MATCHES NO MAIN MEMBER NAME.
               A SPURIOUS *ORPHAN* WILL BE GENERATED WHEN
               AN ALIAS MEMBER NAME MATCHES THE SEARCH MASK,
               BUT THE MAIN NAME DOES NOT. ALSO, AN ALIAS WILL NOT
               BE SHOWN IF IT DOES NOT MATCH THE SEARCH MASK
               EVEN THOUGH THE MAIN MEMBER NAME MATCHES AND
               IS DISPLAYED.
