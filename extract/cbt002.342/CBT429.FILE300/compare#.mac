)F FUNCTION -
  THE COMPARE COMMAND COMPARES TWO SEQUENTIAL DATA SETS OR MEMBERS.

  THE COMPARE IS DONE BY EITHER THE YALE COMPARE PROGRAM (COMPAREB)
  OR BY THE IBM COMPARE UTILITY PROGRAM (IEBCOMPR).

  THE 'SYSPRINT' MESSAGES ARE WRITTEN TO WHEREVER FILENAME(SYSPRINT)
  IS ALLOCATED - USUALLY TO THE TERMINAL.

)X SYNTAX  -
        COMPARE  'OLD-DSNAME'  'NEW-DSNAME'  ZEBCOMPR/IEBCOMPR  FULL
                  ASM/NOASM   OVOL(VOLUME)  NVOL(VOLUME)  OUNIT(UNIT)
                  NUNIT(UNIT) PRINT/SYSOUT/NOPRINT/OUTFILE(DDNAME)

  REQUIRED - 'OLD DSNAME'   'NEW DSNAME'
  DEFAULTS - THE YALE COMPARE PROGRAM (COMPAREB) IS USED.
             ASM     - TREAT SOURCE CODE AS IF IT WERE ASSEMBLY
                       LANGUAGE CODE, I.E. SEQ NUMBERS IN 73-80
             PRINT   - MSGS GO TO TERMINAL
  ALIAS    - NONE
)O OPERANDS -
  'DSNAME1' -  THE NAME OF THE SYSUT1 OR OLD DATA SET. A
               MEMBER NAME MUST BE SPECIFIED IF IT IS PARTITIONED.
  'DSNAME2' -  THE NAME OF THE SYSUT2 OR NEW DATA SET. A
               MEMBER NAME MUST BE SPECIFIED IF IT IS PARTITIONED.
))IEBCOMPR - THE IBM UTILITY PROGRAM 'IEBCOMPR' IS TO BE USED.
))PRINT    - MSGS GO TO THE TERMINAL
))SYSOUT   - MSGS TO A SYSOUT DATA SET.
))NOPRINT  - MSGS TO A DUMMY FILE.
))OUTFILE(DDNAME) - MSGS TO A SPECIFIED DDNAME.
))FULL     - INCLUDE THE SEQUENCE NUMBERS
))ASM      - COMPARING ASSEMBLER SOURCE CODE.
))NOASM    - COMPARING NON-ASSEMBLER SOURCE CODE.
))OVOLUME(VOLUME) - VOLUME CONTAINING THE OLD DATA SET.
))NVOLUME(VOLUME) - VOLUME CONTAINING THE NEW DATA SET.
))OUNIT(UNIT)     - UNIT TYPE OF THE OLD DATA SET.
))NUNIT(UNIT)     - UNIT TYPE OF THE NEW DATA SET.
