   THIS IS A COLLECTION OF HANDY DANDY, QUICK N DIRTY REXX EXECS
   THAT DO SOME USEFUL THINGS.  TRY EM.  YOU (MAY) LIKE EM.

   THERE ARE TWO ASSEMBLER ROUTINES:  UCBSUBR, RDSNALL
   THERE IS ONE TSO HELP MEMBER    :  LST#
   THERE IS ONE ASSEMBLER MACRO    :  REGS

   PLEASE NOTE THAT SOME DISPLACEMENTS IN CONTROL BLOCKS MAY VARY
   FROM ONE RELEASE OF MVS TO ANOTHER.  IF AN EXEC DOESN'T WORK ON
   YOUR SYSTEM, THAT MAY BE SOMETHING THAT'S WORTH LOOKING INTO.

   THERE MAY ALSO BE SOME DEPENDENCY ON THE RELEASE OF TSO/E REXX.
   ANYWAY, ALL THE STUFF IN THIS FILE IS OF THE NATURE THAT THE
   USER HAS TO TRY AND MAKE IT WORK (IF IT DOESN'T DO SO BY ITSELF).

   GOOD LUCK.
