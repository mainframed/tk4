 /********************* LINEGRP  ISPF EDIT MACRO *********************/

 /* LINES OF A DATASET TOGETHER.   THIS CAN BE USEFUL WHEN EXAMINING */
 /* A LARGE LIST WITH  THE  INTENT  OF  EXTRACTING  SOME OF THE DATA */
 /* LINES.  A COPY OF THE LINE SELECTED IS GROUPED AT THE TOP OF THE */
 /* FORM OF AN EDIT NOTELINE.   THE  ORIGINAL DATA IS NOT DISTURBED, */
 /* AND THE NOTELINES CAN  BE  CONVERTED  TO  DATA USING THE MD LINE */
 /* COMMAND OF EDIT.  THE MACRO  IS  ENTERED ON THE COMMAND LINE AND */
 /* THE CURSOR SHOULD BE ON THE TARGET  LINE.  A PFKEY CAN BE SET TO */
 /* THE VALUE LINEGRP TO HELP WHEN DOING A LARGE GROUP OF LINES.     */
