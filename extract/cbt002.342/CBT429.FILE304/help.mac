./ ADD NAME=LC
)F Function -
   LC command is used to display/assemble a list of data sets within a
   given index level or with a given index string prefix.
   The user may select terminal display or may direct output to a
   data set.
   Output records have the following format:
   VOLSER    pos 2-7
   VOLSEQ    pos 8-10  (like: ,001) - for tape data sets
   DSNAME    pos 12-nn
   UCAT      r-j at end of record (if UCAT operand was used)

)X Syntax -
   LC LEVEL('index.level') × STRING('index.string*') +
      DSN('dataset name') × DDN('ddname') +
      UCAT('user-catalog')
   Defaults:  No DSN/DDN for output file (terminal display mode)
              LEVEL/STRING is assumed to be the TSO PROFILE prefix.
              Current catalog environment is assumed.
)O Operands -
))LEVEL     Full index levels within which to list data sets.
            This may be specified as LEVEL/LVL/L/U
))STRING    Index level string ending with a partial index level.
            This may be specified as STRING/STR/S
            Example:   S('SYS1.BB*') RETURNS ALL DATASETS BEGINNING
            'SYS1.BB', VERY HELPFUL TO SYSTEM PROGRAMMERS
))DSN       Data set name in which to place output from LC command.
            Optional.  May be specified as DS/DSN/OUTDS/ODS/DATASET/DA
))DDN       DDname allocated to which LC may write its output.
            Optional. May be specified as DD/DDN/FI/F/FILE/OUTFILE/OUTFI
))UCAT      Name of user catalog, fully qualified without apostrophes,
            to use in the search instead of the current catalog.
            Optional.
./ ADD NAME=LVXOP
)F Function -
   The LVXOP CLIST assembles a list of dataset names to process under a
   given index level, enables the user to update the list of datasets
   to be operated upon, and then, if permitted, will perform the same
   operation on each dataset.

   LVXOP can produce a file with two columns of dataset names when the
   OUTINDEX operand is used.  This is used in such cases where several
   datasets under a given high level index will be renamed.

   LVXOP is available to TSO users who can access SYS2.SYSTEMS.CMDPROC.

   It is new, being "shaken out" (91-03-25).  Please report problems,
   suggestions to EIA Systems Programming Support.

)X Syntax -

   LVXOP 'level' OP('operation') IGNORE('ignore_string') +
         OUTINDEX('new_high_index')  MASK('mask_string') +
         PREOP('pre_string')  POSTOP('post_string')  NOAPOST

   Required:  'level'

   Defaults:  OP('LISTD ')

   Note:      See details of syntax included in operands descriptions.

   EXAMPLE:  LVXOP 'ABC.XYZ' OP('DELETE ') MASK(DATA)

         Assembles list of datasets whose names start with ABC.XYZ.
         and which names contain the string "DATA".  If the user
         leaves the dataset names in the file after ISPF EDIT, then
         those files will be DELETEd.

   EXAMPLE:  LVXOP 'ABC.XYZ' OP('RENAME ') OUTINDEX(NEWHIGH.)

         Assemble list of dataset names under 'ABC.XYZ.' and
         invoke ISPF EDIT to edit the list.  Those files whose names
         remain in the file after EDIT will be renamed to high index
         "NEWHIGH."

   EXAMPLE:  lvxop 'abc' op('p:receive a:') ignore(abc.) +
             pre(' c:') noapost post(' ascii crlf')

         Construct a command line appropriate for download:
             p:send a:jcl.cntl c:jcl.cntl ascii crlf
         (Some editting may be needed to conform to DOS file names)

)O Operands -

))level      The index level under which to list datasets.  If using
             PROFILE PREFIX(xxxxxx), then the level, if not entered
             in quotes, will be under the current TSO prefix xxxxxx.

))operation  The operation/command to be issued for each dataset.
             This may be a command or CLIST.

         Example:  To rename a group of datasets,
         lvxop 'sys3.vsamasst.v1' out(sys3.vsamasst.v2.) op('rename ')

    -->  Note:  The operation string is included in the constructed
         command line with no spaces, so the operation string should
         be entered within apostrophes with one trailing blank for
         normal operation.  In some cases, a preceding blank may be
         useful.  This command line construction was chosen to
         satisfy unusual situations.

))ignore_string
         This value is the leftmost constant string to ignore in names
         of datasets.  The string which is ignored is that constant
         number of characters on the left side of all dataset names
         that is removed from the left side of all dataset names in
         constructing the resulting command lines.  The IGNORE string
         need not match any dataset name - it is used only to obtain a
         length of string to ignore.

         If IGNORE is not used but OUTINDEX is present, then the
         default IGNORE string will be the input 'level' string.

    -->  Note:  Include a period in the IGNORE string if the IGNORE
         string represents a complete index level.  The IGNORE string
         may represent a partial index level.

))new_high_index
         This value is the new high-level index level to prefix the
         "stub" of the dataset name after the IGNORE string has been
         removed.  If a period is to terminate the index string, then
         include it.  Otherwise, the new_high_index will be prefixed to
         the dataset name stub with no period inserted.
         If the OUTINDEX operand is not used, then the resulting
         command file will contain only one column of dataset names.

))mask_string
         This is a selection mask.  If MASK is not used, then all names
         under 'level' will be selected.  If MASK is used, then only
         those dataset names containing the MASK string will be
         selected.  The mask string consists only of characters
         permitted in catalogued dataset names.  "Wild card" characters
         are not permitted.

    -->  Note:  The mask string may contain a period and so may span
         two or more or partial index levels.

))pre_string
         This string will be inserted into the resulting command just
         before the new_high_index.  If a space is required, use
         apostrophes and include the space inside the string.

    -->  Note:  There is no space inserted into the constructed
         command line, so the pre-string may be used as a string
         containing one space within apostrophes to supply the
         blank that is usually required for proper command syntax.

))post_string
         This string will be inserted into the resulting command just
         after the new dataset name.  If a space is required, use
         apostrophes and include the space inside the string.

    -->  Note:  This operand may be entered within apostrophes and may
         contain additional command line text.

))NOAPOST   If this keyword operand is used, then the resulting command
         line will not contain apostrophes in dataset names.  This is
         useful for mass download command construction, for example,
         where apostrophes in dataset names would not be permitted.
         This use restricts references to mainframe datasets to those
         prefixed by the TSO user's current PROFILE PREFIX string.
