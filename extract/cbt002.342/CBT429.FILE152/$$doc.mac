   AGGETVLI   subroutine used in INLINE
   AGTERM     subroutine used in INLINE
   AMAZING    Produce a maze with one entrance and one exit
              (source)
   AMAZING2   Run the program, print on a printer that does not skip
              over the perfs.
   CALENDAR   Print a combined Julian and Gegorian calendar for any
              year
   F11UP      PPFA source, form defintion for 1 up printing
   F12UP      PPFA source, form definition for rotated 2 up printing
   INLINE     Cobol source for a program to copy pagedefs and formdefs
              inline with the data for testing new page and form defs
              Compiled with the NORES parameter with the old OS/VS COBOL
              compiler
   INLINER    Run time JCL for INLINE
   JOVERBLD   The SAS job to create PSF type overlays
   NCZ93205   An updated version of a PDS member read subroutine found
              on the CBT tape, one bug corrected, extra parameter added
              so the calling program can pass a DDNAME to read from
   O$$DOC     Documentation on the two overlays
   O11UP      Source for the PSF 1 up overlay
   O12UP      Source for the PSF 2 up overlay
   POSTERT    JCL to run Poster for non-laser printers
   POSTERT2   Decompiled source for the POSTER program found on the CBT
              tape, some bugs fixed, card input now allowed
   POSTER2    JCL to print POSTER output on a SIEMENS/STC laser printer
              which are compatible with IBM 3800-3/6 printers but you
              can print perf to perf, but with some degradation
   PSFSCAN    A series of SAS programs used to print and manipulate PSF
              objects.  I have used them to make simple changes to
              character sets, modify bar code fonts, produce rotated
              fonts, produce our own grey bar pattern, and produce our
              own simple overlays.
              These have been designed around the 3800 type printer
              there are differences with 3820/3835 fonts that these
              programs probably will not handle.  Since we do not have
              the other printers I could not modify and test the
              programs.

   PSFSCANH   Load a code page into a SAS file, ie T1xxxxx member
   PSFSCANI   Print the code page from the SAS file
   PSFSCANJ   Delete a character from the SAS code page file
   PSFSCANK   Add a character to the SAS code page file
   PSFSCANL   Build a new code page from the SAS file
   PSFSCANM   Take 3800-3 "down" font and change it into an "up" font
              ie take a C2xxxxx member and change into a C4xxxxx
   PSFSCANN   Print an up raster pattern from the SAS file
   PSFSCANO   Build the "up" character set from the SAS file
   PSFSCANP   Compare a SAS character set and SAS code page
   PSFSCANQ   Build an overlay using SAS and source commands
              A sample overlay testing out all of the commands
   PSFSCAN1   Read a group of X1xxxx font members, sort and print data
   PSFSCAN4   Print info on one T1xxxxx member, a code page print
   PSFSCAN5   Print info on 1 C1xxxxx member, a character group
   PSFSCAN6   Print info on a group of character groups
   PSFSCAN7   Print a 1 line summary on a single character groups
   PSFSCAN8   Print a 1 page summary on a group of character groups
   PSFSCAN9   Print info and the raster pattern of one character group
   P12UP      PPFA source for our 2 up page def
   P18B2      PPFA source for our 1 up page def
   RFIXMOVE   Subroutine used in INLINER

   TIMETAKE   Source for a program analyser program.  The program
              loads and runs a target program.  It sets a timer which
              is used to sample where a program is (PSW instruction)
              and write the info out to a file.  This can be used to
              tell you where your program is spending the most time.
              Works on 24 or 31 bit programs.
              There are much better programs on the market.
              It is best if all of the subroutines are linked as part
              of the load module.
   TIMEHIST   COBOL program used to print a histogram of the data
              gathered by TIMETAKE.  This is an old OS/VS Cobol
              program.
   TIMHISTJ   Sample JCL for running TIMEHIST
   TIMTAKEJ   Sample JCL for running TIMETAKE
   X$$DOC     Doc on our Character sets
