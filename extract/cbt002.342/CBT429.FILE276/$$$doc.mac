This edit macro called CHECKSUM makes ZAPping with checksums extremely
easy.  Just edit the ZAP job, place a CC-CC block as a line command
against the VER and REP statements you want to look at, include a
blank CHECKSUM word on a new line below the CC-CC block, and invoke
the macro CHECKSUM from the command line.  A calculated CHECKSUM value
will be inserted after the blank CHECKSUM word you've included.
