A bit of doc for Level V2R3M1.

  Note first -  This program does not properly fold long lines
                in REXX execs.

  Oops, I didn't know that if you have a VB CLIST that wasn't
blank in columns 1-8, or if it wasn't all numeric there, then
the CLIST processor will execute the data in columns 1-8.
If all blanks, or numerics, then the CLIST processor ignores
1-8.  This is done on a line-by-line basis.  Now I know.

  Version 2 R3M1, was created to properly convert VB CLISTs with
good data in columns 1-8.  It also reports on what it found,
member by member.  Lines containing good data in columns 1-8 are
counted, and short VB records of length less than 8 are counted.
