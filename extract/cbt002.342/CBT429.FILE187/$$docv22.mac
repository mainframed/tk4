//*  CHANGES FOR VERSION 2.2    -  SAM GOLOB  -  11/27/90.          *
//*                                                                 *
//*   Fix bug which dropped all succeeding members of a directory   *
//*   block after processing a member which had the alias flag      *
//*   set.  Fixed by a one-line fix after the two MVC instructions  *
//*   following the label GETMEM.    NI   11(R8),X'1F'              *
//*                                                                 *
//*   Add support for flagging CLIST execution errors caused by     *
//*   not removing sequence numbers from an FB CLIST converted to   *
//*   VB by hand.  If a record in a VB CLIST has all numerics       *
//*   in data columns 81-88, it is flagged.  The member level       *
//*   report states:    6 STRIP    to signify that 6 records may    *
//*   need to have leftover "sequence numbers" blanked out.         *
//*                                                                 *
//*   At this level, no support has yet been added to blank out     *
//*   the spurious sequence numbers automatically.                  *
//*                                                                 *
//*                                                                 *
//*  CHANGES FOR VERSION 2.1    -  SAM GOLOB  -  10/17/90.          *
//*                                                                 *

//*** VERSION 322 - OCTOBER 1990.                                   *
//*                                                                 *
//*        05  THIS PROGRAM MAKES IT POSSIBLE TO EASILY CONVERT     *
//*            THE CLIST FORMATS OF ANY SHOP.  NOW, YOU ARE NOT     *
//*            "FROZEN" IN ANY ONE CLIST FORMAT.                    *
//*                                                                 *
//*            DEFAULT EXECUTION OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO REPLACE      *
//*            EXISTING MEMBERS IN THE OUTPUT LIBRARY.  IF YOU      *
//*            DON'T WANT TO REPLACE EXISTING MEMBERS, EXECUTE      *
//*            THE PROGRAM WITH ANY PARM.  I USE PARM='NOREPLACE'.  *
//*                                                                 *
//*            UPGRADE OF THE CLIST CONVERT PROGRAM FROM FILE 187   *
//*            TO VERSION 2.1 FROM SAM GOLOB.  CODE WAS ADDED TO    *
//*            SUPPORT NONEMPTY LIBRARIES AS THE TARGET OF THE      *
//*            VB-FB OR FB-VB CONVERSION.  THE STOW WAS CHANGED     *
//*            TO BE A "REPLACE" TYPE INSTEAD OF AN "ADD" TYPE.     *
//*            THE SYSPRINT REPORT WAS MODIFIED TO SHOW THE MEMBER  *
//*            NAMES, AND WHETHER EACH ONE WAS ADDED OR REPLACED.   *
//*            FOR VARIABLE-TO-FIXED FORMAT CONVERSIONS, COUNTS     *
//*            OF THE NUMBER OF LINE SPLITS ARE PROVIDED.  THE      *
//*            SUMMARY REPORT SHOWS THE NUMBER OF ADDED ITEMS,      *
//*            THE NUMBER OF REPLACED ITEMS, THE TOTAL NUMBER OF    *
//*            CONVERTED ITEMS, AND THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ALL THE     *
//*            LINE SPLITS THAT WERE DONE DURING THIS RUN.          *
//*                                                                 *
//*            FOR VARIABLE-TO-FIXED FORMAT CONVERSIONS, COUNTS     *
//*            OF THE NUMBER OF LINE SPLITS ARE PROVIDED.  IF       *
//*            ISPF STATISTICS EXIST FOR A MEMBER THAT HAD LINE     *
//*            SPLITS, THE RECORD COUNT IS ADJUSTED UPWARD BY THE   *
//*            NUMBER OF SPLITS.  THE TRUE SIZE WILL BE SHOWN.      *
//*            FOR A MEMBER THAT HAD NO ISPF STATS IN THE DIREC-    *
//*            TORY, NO DIRECTORY CHANGES ARE DONE.                 *
//*                                                                 *
//*            YOU CAN NOW USE THIS PROGRAM TO MERGE SEVERAL CLIST  *
//*            LIBRARIES AT THE SAME TIME YOU ARE CONVERTING THEM.  *
//*                                                                 *
//*            CLIST RENUMBERING IS DONE AUTOMATICALLY AS PART OF   *
//*            THE CONVERSION.                                      *
//*                                                                 *
//*            THE INPUT AND OUTPUT DATASET NAMES ARE SHOWN IN      *
//*            THE REPORT NOW.  PAGE EJECTS AND PAGE COUNTS HAVE    *
//*            BEEN ADDED.                                          *
//*                                                                 *
//*            WHEN SPLITTING LONG LINES IN A VARIABLE-TO-FIXED     *
//*            FORMAT CONVERSION, THE PROGRAM SPLITS THEM AND       *
//*            FOLDS THEM WITH NO DECISIONS MADE.  THUS, THE        *
//*            CONVERTED CLISTS SHOULD EXECUTE EXACTLY THE SAME     *
//*            AS THE ORIGINAL CLISTS.  (THEY MAY LOOK FUNNY, BUT   *
//*            WHO CARES, AS LONG AS THEY "RUN GOOD".)              *
//*                                                                 *
//*            SEE THE OTHER DOC MEMBER FOR LINE-SPLITTING LOGIC.   *
//*                                                                 *
//*            THIS PROGRAM HAS BECOME A POWERFUL TOOL TO           *
//*            ACCOMPLISH MASS CLIST FORMAT CONVERSIONS IN          *
//*            EITHER DIRECTION.                                    *
//*                                                                 *
