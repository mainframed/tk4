         But it's also a comprehensive list of S/390 sites.

  IBM sites    Hardware     Networking

         I won't pretend everything is referenced here but at least,
         you should be able to find a good starting point when
         you're looking for a S/390 resource. Of course, you won't
         miss pages like "IBM", "Software" (ISV), "Consulting" (also
         includes training services),... but "people", "newsgroups"
         and "mailing lists" will help you meet specialists online.
         Recruiters are waiting for you on the job page.

     Jobs      Information    Books

  Training &   Mailing lists  Newsgroups
  Consulting

    People     Repository     Software

         And some other pages that you might be interested in.
