CPPUPDTE and IPOUPDTE Documentation:

CPPUPDTE is a utility program used by the ServerPac installation
process.  Formerly known as IPOUPDTE, and orginally shipped with
CBIPO, this program will search for a string in all members of a
partitioned data set and change that string to another string.  In
ServerPac, CPPUPDTE is supplied in the hlq.order_number.LOADLIB data
set with an alias of IPOUPDTE.  IBM supports this program only
within the documented installation processes for ServerPac and
CBIPO.  They used to supply the instructions for using it in the
DOCLIB data set, but do not do this in ServerPac.  However, many
people have found it useful over the years, and IBM is making the
documentation originally shipped with CBIPO available on a website
for use on an as-is basis at this URL:

On this web page, see CPPUPDTE under the heading, "Other Useful
Resources." (At the time this was written, this heading is near the
bottom of the page.)  When you click on the link, you will have to
accept IBM's terms and conditions to view or download the
instructions.
