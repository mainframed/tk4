           TASID: System information and a whole lot more

                       Current version 5.05K
         (Slightly new than the 5.05K on the ISPF web site)

  -------------------------------------------------------------------

              A description of TASID is available at
       http://www.software.ibm.com/ad/ispf/downloads/tasid.html.
  I've also provided a page of fast loading screen samples (about 100K
                            of download in 1 page).

       The version with separate panel and load libraries. Slightly
       harder to install, but starts up faster.

       To install this, create the load module and panel library
       according to the installation instructions in the README file.
       Then allocate the panel library to ISPPLIB and the load
       library to ISPLLIB, or STEPLIB, or Linklist or LPA.

 tasid.zip  If you don't have access to the allocations, use a
            CLIST like this:

      ISPEXEC LIBDEF ISPPLIB DATASET ID('NADEL.TASID.PANELS') STACK
      ISPEXEC LIBDEF ISPLLIB DATASET ID('NADEL.TASID.LOAD') STACK
      ISPEXEC SELECT PGM(TASID) NEWAPPL(ISR) PASSLIB
      ISPEXEC LIBDEF ISPPLIB
      ISPEXEC LIBDEF ISPLLIB

        The version with the panels built into the load module. Very
        easy to install, takes a little longer to start.

        To start this version, just create the load module and either
        place it in one of the places listed above, or simply use the
        TSO CALL statement, similar to:

 tasid0.zip       Option ===> TSO CALL 'NADEL.TASID.LOAD(TASID)'

            or

                  Option ===> TSO CALL TASID(TASID)

               Introduction from Doug Nadel's Home Page
  -------------------------------------------------------------------

                    A Few OS/390 Tools and Toys.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to my OS/390 Freeware page. Although this is not an official
IBM page, the programs distributed on this page were written on
IBM-owned equipment and as such are (c) Copyright IBM Corp. 1998,
1999, All rights reserved.

Some of the programs here were written in response to questions I've
heard at work, at SHARE conferences or on the bit.listserv.ibm-main or
bit.listserv.ispf-l mailing lists. A few were written to make my job
easier, and some were written just for fun.

  I've written these programs because I enjoy doing that. If you find
  them useful, please let me know. --Thanks

Additional ISPF tools can be found at the ISPF Home Page.

I'll be glad to provide support for any of these programs on a
time-available basis and all comments and requests are welcome!

Here's what you'll find on these pages:

   TASID         Full screen system information display and much
                 more

                 string
   LOGOFF        Allow LOGOFF as a primary option menu choice

   MACROSPY      View editor status during macro execution
   PROFDUMP      Dump all profile variables to a data set.
   DUMPVAR       Display a variable in dump format

 These programs were written on my employer's (IBM's) equipment
 and in some cases, on IBM's time. Therefore, all copyright rights
 are assigned to IBM and I include this disclaimer.

I have been a developer of ISPF for about 15 years and have, for the
last couple of years, also done Level 2 & 3 work (Tech support &
fixes). Some of the work I've done included edit highlight, relaxing
the 255 byte restrictions in edit, edit COMPARE, various edit work,
ISRDDN, many service aids (ISPVCALL, etc.) as well as little things
all over the place. Having said all that, let me emphasize that these
programs are not specifically endorsed by nor supported by IBM.
Support for them is generally on my own time.

                Comments and suggestions are always welcome.
