MVS FREEWARE ON THE WEB   -   Dave Cartwright's list as of 10/19/99
=======================

The greatest site for free MVS software on the web is of course the
home page for the CBT Tape;
 http://www.cbttape.org/

If you are lucky enough to work for a company that subscribes the
one of the XEPHON Update periodicals you will be able to download
recent programs.  They have kindly made the archives accessible to
everyone, there is a lot of older code there which is still useful.
 http://www.xephon.com/down1.html

There are a lot of IBM sites with downloads available. These are
being updated frequently, so I will not list them. Start from one of
the main IBM sites and see what you can find
(Hint: look at RACF and Unix System Services).

Other vendors give away MVS Freeware, try;
 http://www.dignus.com/
 ftp://www.mackinney.com/freebies
and many others.


PERSONAL SITES                  (this character ~ is a tilde)
==============

Bill Lalonde (<billlalonde@rocketmail.com> has a site with links to
many freeware sites.
 http://members.tripod.com/~billlalonde/

Dave Alcock's site includes his own contributions and links to other
freeware sites;
 http://users.ticnet.com/davea/mvs/start.htm


David Pitts has ported the GCC and EGCS compilers to USS. His site
is at;
 http://www.cozx.com/~dpitts/gcc.html
Make sure you read the instructions.

Another general interest site with downloads on it is at
 http://mainframes.com/
It appears to be the personal site of Mike Muuss <mike@arl.mil>

If you like ISRDDN, take a look at the website of the guy who wrote
it, Doug Nadel;
 http://www.mindspring.com/~somebody/
This is the site where you can find TASID.

Ashley Street <a.street@btinternet.com> has a page with some TSO and
REXX stuff at;
 http://www.btinternet.com/~ashleys/fadh_software.htm

Michael Cleary has a freeware page at;
 http://home.pacbell.net/mcleary/freeware.html

You can download Michael A. Newell's brilliant PDS2PDS dialog from;
 http://wb4huc.home.texas.net/pds2pds/
I cannot speak too highly of this contribution.

Gerard Nicol's home page at
 http://www.leichhardt.net.au/gerard/
contains his REXX Function Pack. But read the instructions because
the method of getting hold of the download is not intuitive.

Mike Porter has a site at;
 http://manatee.nss.udel.edu/
where you can download his SAPI code.

There is a lot of REXX and other TSO stuff at;
http://users.arn.net/~mvsopert/
from Rodney Hinds.

David Elder-Vass has put a lot of his book about Systems Programming
onto the web at;
 http://www.mvsbook.fsnet.co.uk/index.htm

There's an agressively anonymous site at
 http://members.home.com/mvs-jes2/
with a lot of downloadable software. It seems to be mostly OCO.
There is a dynamic STEPLIB command, the HELP text for which looks
very much like Gilbert Saint-flour's old one.

I had a lot of trouble with the frames on Nigel Pentland's site at
 http://www.cairnleck.co.uk/nigel/
but the RACF link did take me to a page of RACF downloads, although
I haven't tried them.

Sam Knutson
 http://www.his.com/~dragon/index2.htm
has a lot of links to freeware sites which he updates faster than I
can update this list!


Rob Scott has some downloads at
 http://www.secltd.co.uk/downloads.htm
which includes his MXI system information tool.

There does not appear to be any shareware at
 http://www.rexxla.org/index.html
but it's a good site to bookmark if you are looking for hints and
tips on the REXX language.

Thierry Falissard's Home Page at
 http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/tfalissard/homepage.htm
is one of those sites that gets indexed from lots of other places.
Because it's good.  He has not got much of his own freeware there,
but he has a lot of links to other freeware sites.  He does have
documentation for IPOUPDTE, which is becoming hard to find, so
thanks, Thierry.

Where would the CBT tape be without Gilbert Saint-flour? You can
download his latest work from;
 http://members.home.net/gsf/

CBT contributor Lionel B. Dyck puts his contribuions on the SHARE
 site;
 http://www.share.org/mvs.html

Another long time CBT contributor is Leonard Woren. His home page
is at;
 http://www.best.com/~ldw/mvs/index.html
