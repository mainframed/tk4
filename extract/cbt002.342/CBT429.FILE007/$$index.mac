$$INDEX             This member,
$$THANKS            A Thank You to contributors.
ACFEXIT             ROSCOE sign on exit that checks RACF password, and
                      builds an ACEE, etc. for ROSCOE users
CLEANACL            CLEANACL's purpose is to check every access list in
                      the RACF dataset to see whether each one contains
                      any non-existent userids or group names. If so, it
                      creates the RACF commands to remove them.
DSAEXIT             ROSCOE dataset authorization checking exit. Performs
                      a RACHECK for datasets accessed by ROSCOE users.
ICHPWX01            RACF password exit that disallows users from
                      changing their passwords multiple times to re-use
                      old passwords.
ICHRCX01            RACHECK pre-processing exit which allows an
                      installation to bypass operator prompts during
                      FAILSOFT processing.
ICHRCX02            RACHECK post-processing exit which (among other
                      things) provides a 'warning' feature for TAPEDSN
                      (Must be used with ICHRDX01 exit in this file).
ICHRDSNU            Sample dataset names table that can be used when
                      you want the operator prompted for the names of
                      your RACF datasets.
ICHRDX01            RACDEF pre-processing exit to provide a 'warning'
                      feature when using TAPEDSN to protect tapes.
ICHRIX02            RACINIT post-processing exit to prevent JES
                      propagation of selected userids.
IGC0023I            An SVC that will turn the JSCB authorization bit
                      on or off if the calling routine is in PLPA, or
                      if it is issued by a RACF defined user that is
                      authorized to the RACF application SVC239.
JESEXIT2            JES exit #2 that validates JOB card parameters by
                      doing a third-party-RACHECK to see if a non-standa
                      JOB card may be used by the job.
JES020              JES exit #20 that inserts programmer name, room#,
                      message class in JOB cards for Started Tasks,
                      TSO userids. and jobs submitted without JOB cards.
JES020S             SMP/E statements for installing JES020 exit.
JOBACESS            TRIANGLE SYSTEMS' product, IOF, contains a RACF
JOBACOPY              interface that controls JES held output.
                      Only useful if you already have 'IOF'. This
                      is simply an example of how it can be done.
LISTRP              Program to show which dataset profiles protect
                      cataloged datasets. Original from SAMPLIB - was
                      converted to PL/I from CLIST.
LISTU               TSO command which will accept a user-id as input
                      and return the user's name and default group.
                      Nice way for anyone to find out the name
                      that goes along with a user-id.
NJEPROP1            JES/NJE propagation support usermod for JES 1.3.4
                      Application of this usermod (thru SMP/E) will
                      utilize JES propagation across NJE nodes,
                      thus allowing RACF password encryption to
                      be turned on.
NJEPROP2            JES/NJE propagation support usermod for JES 2.1.5
                      same as above, except for JES 2.1.5/MVS 2.1.7
NJEPROP3            JES/NJE propagation support usermod for JES 2.2.0
OMRACF              OMEGAMON/MVS RACF interface.
                      This source is provided by Candle Corp.,
                      however, there are some minor changes that
                      may be of interest to others.
RACFALT             Generates a CLIST of ALTDSD commands to change
                      volsers of all profiles referencing a specific
                      volume to point to a different volume.
RACFDOC             Instructions and sample JCL to run the RACFRPT
                      report writer program.
RACFDSET            Produces a flat file of RACF dataset profile informa
                      that can be used as input to report writing progra
RACFGRES            Produces a flat file of RACF general resource profil
                      information that can be used as input to report
                      writing programs.
RACFGRP1            Produces a flat file of RACF group profile informati
                      that can be used as input to report writing progra
RACFGRP2            Produces a flat file of RACF group profile informati
                      that can be used as input to report writing progra
                      Note that the information is different from that
                      created in RACFGRP1.
RACFLIST            CLIST to execute the LISTRP program.
RACFPROF            Program to read the RACF dataset and write the
                      contents out to a vb dataset for later use.
RACFPROT            This TSO command accepts one or more catalog
                      nodes and uses IKJEHCIR to do a catalog locate.
                      A RACHECK 'PRIVATE' is then done for each data set
                      name to find out what generic profile protects
                      the data set. The data set name and profile name
                      are then written to the terminal via PUTLINE.
RACFRPT             A program to produce slick RACF reports using SMF
                      data.
RACFSAMP            Sample job to produce cross-reference reports using
                      programs RACFUSR, RACFGRES, SAS, and DYL280.
RACFSUMM            Program similar to RACFPROF, except the output
                      dataset contains 80 byte records containing the
                      profile type, and the name of the profile. Useful
                      as input to SAS programs.
RACFTSO5            Program to read UADS and copy over the initial TSO
                      command field (which RACONVRT doesn't do).
RACFUSER            Program to read the RACF dataset and print a report
                      listing password expiration data.
RACFUSR             Produces a flat file of user profile information for
                      input to report writing programs.
RACRIX01            RACINIT pre-processing exit to construct userids
                      for production jobs and to prevent any job from
                      starting if no userid is present.
RACRIX02            RACINIT post-processing exit to check ABENDs and
                      return codes from RACINIT and decide whether to
                      kill a job or not.
RGROUP              Program to change the group to which a user of job
                      is currently connected.
SACXTRT             Program to extract connect profile information.
SACXTRT             Program to extract group profile information.
SANOADSP            Program to turning off 'ADSP' on user profiles.
SAPXTRT             Program to extract User-id and Password info.
SARUSRUX            SAR exit to verify userid and password when SAR is
                      executed under ROSCOE.
SASRGEN             SAS program which produces a set of generic
                    profiles from a set of discrete profiles.  This
                    can be of use to installations wanting a tool
                    to automate conversion from discrete to generic
                    profiles.
SASRLIST            SAS program to produce a concise access list
                    report from output of the LISTDSD command.
SAUNMASK            Program for unmasking a user's password in RACF.
SAUXTRT             Program to extract user profile information.
SETPW               TSO command to 'set' a userid's password without
                      the password expiring.  Useful when you need to
                      set a userid's password, but do not want the
                      passdate changed to zeros.
SETPW2              A different version of the 'SETPW' command that
                      authorizes users without special to perform the
                      equivilent of 'ALTUSER userid RESUME PASSWORD(x)
                      For special users, it works just like 'SETPW'.
SETUSER             TSO command processor used to insert information
                      into the RACF user profile for use by the JES020
                      exit that is on this file.
SETUSERH            TSO HELP file for the SETUSER TSO command.
SETUSERS            SMP/E statements for installing the SETUSER command.
STARTASK            Macro to easily code the RACF Started task table
                      ICHRIN03.
SUBEXIT             ROSCOE submit exit which checks installation job
                      card rules, and puts the RACF userid, password,
                      and default group on the JOB card.
TEC107              Flip all the 'RACF BITS' for NON-VSAM ds on a VTOC
                      volume.  This is from the SHARE CBT mods tape,
                      however, this has been modified to work in an
                      'XA' environment, which the SHARE version did
                      not.
TECZ00              ISPF message member for VLOGON.
TMPFRONT            Front end to the TMP to allow turning off of TSO
                      for all but Tech Support users during system
                      test times.
TMS#RACF            Portion of an 'IEFUJI' exit to place the RACF
                      userid of a JOB that uses UCC1/TMS services
                      into the UCC1/TMS accounting information
                      fields for 'owner' data.
TSOSUB01            TSO submit exit to put userid and password on the
                      job card.
UADSDUMP            Program to dump 'SYS1.UADS' and generate the
                      control cards for 'ACCOUNT' to re-build
                      'SYS1.UADS'.
UADSREF             Program to generate the 'ACCOUNT' control
                       cards for adding/deleting of userids
UCC7DSNX            UCC7 external dataset exit.
UCC7LOGF            UCC7 logoff exit to delete the ACEE.
UCC7LOGO            UCC7 logon exit to create the ACEE, etc.
UNPROTCT            Produces AMASPZAP control cards to turn off all
                      RACF VTOC bits on a volume.
VLOGON              ISPF dialog to allow updates to certain TSO logon
                      fields.  This may be useful if you use RACF 1.8
                      TSO support but don't use the std. LOGON screen.
                      References VLOGONP, TECZ00.
VLOGONP             Panel for VLOGON to use.  References tutorial panel
                      VLOGONT (not provided).
WHOIS               TSO command to look at a RACF userid's "NAME"
                       field and display it at a terminal.
WPC                 The 'What Profile Covers' command.  Authorized TSO
                       command processor will tell you what profile
                       (discrete or generic) protects a dataset. (This
                       is similar to RACFPROT, but does a specified
                       dataset name instead of a catalog node.)
ZAPDFP              This used to be a ZAP to DFP to bypass the 'kick dow
                       of tapes when using TAPEDSN. IBM has now come up
                       with an acceptable way to get around this. See th
                       member for the APAR, PTFs, etc.



There are two files on the SHARE MVS GROUP mods tape that are also
RACF related and may be useful. They are:

   File 024 - Some sample exits, and sample programs to test RACF
              macros. This stuff is old, but may be useful.

   File 026 - Miller Brewing RACF mods. Includes UCC1 mods for tape
              protection, exits, SMF processing programs. This stuff
              is also old, but still in use at some sites.

Version 001   04/01/87
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first one...

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 002   05/19/87
------------------------------------------------------------------------

New version of RACFRPT that cleaned up some bugs and allowed the use of
  the 'STATS' option to give a roll-up of violations.
New version of $NOPROP exit to disallow userid propagation.
Addition of the WHOIS command processor that displays the RACF name
  field for the userid passed to it.
Addition of a SAR user exit to provide userid and password when executin
  SAR under ROSCOE.
New version of macro ACHKLIST which is used in some exits on this tape.
Addition of a RACHECK post-processing exit that provides a warning featu
  for TAPEDSN.
Addition of a ZAP to DFP R2.2 to ignore the 'write enabled' so MVS does
  kick down tapes with TAPEDSN turned on.
Addition of SASRGEN and SASRLIST SAS programs from Dan Squillace. SASRGE
  will build RACF commands to create generic profiles out of discrete
  profiles - great for going generic! SASRLIST will create a report of
  what is on dataset profile access lists.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 003   06/15/87
------------------------------------------------------------------------

New version of ICHRIX02 (RACINIT post-processing) exit to prevent JES
  propagation of selected user ids (renamed $NOPROP).
New version of ICHRCX02 (RACHECK post-processing) exit to provide a
  warning feature when using TAPEDSN.
ICHRDX01 (RACDEF pre-processing) exit to provide the rest of what is
  needed for a 'warning' feature for when you use TAPEDSN.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 004   12/15/87
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Put all loose macros into one member called 'MACROS'.
Added members NJEPROP3, SACXTRT, SAGXTRT, SANOADSP, SAPXTRT, SAUNMASK,
  SAUXTRT. Updates for members ICHRCX02, ICHRDX01, UCC7LOGO.
Changed version numbers on ISPF stats to conform to version number of
  the tape it was last changed on.
Added 5 programs from Scott Wilson at the City of Long Beach Ca. that wi
  dump information from the RACF database for various profile types.
  The JCL to run the programs is included. Members are: RACFDSET, RACFGR
  RACFGRP1, RACFGRP2, RACFUSR. As sample application which uses two of t
  programs is included in member RACFSAMP.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 005   01/19/88
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Removed usermod code in member 'ZAPDFP' because IBM has supplied the
  function via an APAR and PTFs (See member for details).
Replaced the following with updated versions: ICHRCX02, ICHRDX01, NJEPRO
  NJEPROP2, NJEPROP3, SACXTRT, SAGXTRT, SANOADSP, SAPXTRT,SASSXXL1, SAUN
  SAUXTRT, WHOIS.
Removed macros ADEFLIST, ACHKLIST from MACROS member, as they are now in
  in the code of ICHRCX02, ICHRDX01.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 006   11/30/88
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Added RACHECK Pre-processing exit ICHRCX01 which allows all accesses dur
  failsoft processing (and bypasses operator prompts) and performs loggi
  for each access.
Added a new version of the RACFRPT report writing program. Also updated
  documentation member for RACFRPT - RACFDOC.
Changed my address and phone number to reflect the move to our new site.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 007   12/28/88
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Added LISTU TSO command which will accept a user-id as input and return
  user's name and default group. Nice way for anyone to find out the nam
  that goes along with a user-id.
Added RACFPROT TSO command. This command accepts one or more catalog
  nodes and uses IKJEHCIR to do a catalog locate. A RACHECK 'PRIVATE' is
  then done for each data set name to find out what generic profile
  protects the data set. The data set name and profile name are then wri
  to the terminal via PUTLINE.
Added JESEXIT2 exit. This is a JES2 exit #2 that uses the third-party
  RACHECK feature of RACF 1.8 to validate JOB card information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 008   01/19/89
------------------------------------------------------------------------

. Taken over from Stuart Sabel by Jim Blalock (Stuart did alot of work!)
. New version of CLEANACL that handles generic dataset profiles better
. Added RACFTSO5, TECZ00, VLOGON, and VLOGONP.
. Added WPC command.
