      NOTES  -

               "RACFRPT" WAS WRITTEN TO PROVIDE A MORE READABLE
               ALTERNATIVE FOR RACF ADMINISTRATORS THAN IBM'S
               TSO RACF REPORT WRITER.  THE GOAL WAS TO BE EASY TO
               USE AND EASY TO READ.

               HOWEVER "RACFRPT" DOES NOT PROVIDED ALL THE DETAIL
               SUMMARY INFORMATION THAT IBM'S RACF REPORT CAN PROVIDE.
               THIS INCLUDES:

                1) THE PROFILE NAME OF THE PROTECTED RESOURCE.
                2) THE LEVEL OF PROTECTION FOR THE PROTECTED RESOURCE.
                3) THE LEVEL OF ACCESS REQUESTED FOR A PROTECTED
                   RESOURCE AND THE HIGHEST LEVEL ALLOWED.
                4) THE AUTHORIZATION GRANTED WITH THE PERMIT COMMAND.
                5) SUCCESSFUL STARTS FOR TSO SESSIONS AND BATCH JOBS.
                   ( UNSUCCESSFUL STARTS ARE RECORDED IN SMF TYPE 80
                     AND THEREFORE SHOW UP IN THIS REPORT )

               WHEN A MORE COMPLETE PICTURE OF AN AUTHORIZED OR UN-
               AUTHORIZED EVENT SHOULD BE NEEDED THE IBM REPORTS CAN
               BE USED TO PROVIDED THE DETAILS.

               THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED AS IS WITHOUT WARRANTY OF
               ANY KIND.  CORRECTIONS, MODIFICATIONS AND COMMENTS
               ARE ENCOURAGED.
