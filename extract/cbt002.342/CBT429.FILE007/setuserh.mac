)F FUNCTION -
     The SETUSER command changes the RACF user profile for fields
     applicable for the automatic assignment of the sysout programmer
     name field and room-number for TSO and started-task printout.
     If no operands, or only the userid operand is specified, then
     the associated userid attributes will be listed.
     As with the ALTUSER command, the SETUSER command will allow you
     to change your 20-character programmer name field.  You can also
     specify a 4-character ROOM number.  In order to change userid's
     other than your own, you must have SPECIAL authority, or have
     UPDATE access to the SETUSER resource in the $APPL class.
     If you have the AUDITOR attribute, then you can list any userid's
     profile information.

     NOTE:  When invoked under ISPF, the SETUSER command must be
            issued via the TSOEXEC command.
)X SYNTAX -
     SETUSER         USERID('userid'/* ... )
                     NAME('user-name')
                     ROOM('room-numb')
                     MSGCLASS('sysout-class')
  REQUIRED - NONE
  DEFAULTS - USERID(*)
  ALIAS    - SETU
)O OPERANDS -
))USERID('userid'...) - Specifies the users for which the specified
     attributes are to be modified.  If this parameter is omitted,
     then the current userid is assumed.
))NAME('user-name') - Specifies a new value for the user's name
     field in the RACF data set.  The name may be from 1 to 20
     alphameric, special, or national characters, the first of
     which must be alphameric.  If special characters and/or
     blanks are included, then the text must be enclosed within
     quotes.
))ROOM('room-numb') - Specifies a 1 to 4 character alphameric room
     number to where your sysout will be delivered.  For TSO users,
     this will be printed on the banner page of dynamically allocated
     sysout datasets.  For started-task jobs, this will be printed
     on the banner page for all sysout.   When ROOM(*) is specified,
     the ROOM value is removed from the user profile.
))MSGCLASS('sysout-class') - Specifies the sysout class for the job
     log, jobjcl, and jobmsg output for started-task jobs.  If the
     MSGCLASS is set for a TSO userid, then sysout for the TSO logon
     will be generated, which is usually not too appropriate.
     When MSGCLASS(*) is specified, the MSGCLASS value is removed.
