FIXING YOUR OLD LINKAGE EDITOR  (IN DFSMS/MVS TOO)


    Even under DFSMS/MVS, with HEWL and IEWL being the new 'binder',
you can still run the old linkage editor if you say EXEC PGM=HEWLKED.
IBM has kept a version of the old linkage editor around.  However,
with the binder, IBM has removed the old (now stupid) restriction
that object decks can't be blocked greater than 3200 bytes, or 40
records per block.  There were memory restrictions once, that are
now long gone.

    I've looked at my copies of the old linkage editor HEWLKED in
DFSMS, and behold, the old restriction hasn't been lifted or cured.
It is so easy to do!  We had a usermod once, which I am bringing
to you now.  I have two versions of this mod, one for DFSMS 1.0,
and another for DFSMS 1.3.  Both are the same as each other, really.
Also, you shouldn't have any trouble fitting this mod to any version
of the old linkage editor, young or old.  I have also included zaps
for all versions of the linkage editor which I had lying around at
our installation, as well as I could determine.
