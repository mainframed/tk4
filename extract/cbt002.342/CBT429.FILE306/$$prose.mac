                          REL  5.0   15  MAY  1991


           THIS SET OF PGMS ALLOWS YOU TO BRING UP A TSO LIKE FUNCTION
           WHEN DISASTER HAS STRUCK,  I/O ERROR IN  BROADCAST DATASET.
           EVER TRY TO KEYPUNCH AND GET IT CORRECT(WHERE ARE THE
           KEYPUNCHES ANYMORE) TSSO' ALLOWS YOU TO START A SUBSYSTEM
           TO DO TSO COMMANDS FROM YOUR OPERATORS CONSOLE.
           SEE THE MEMBER TSSODOC FOR MORE INFORMATION.

           WOULD LIKE TO THANK BILL GODFREY OF PLANNING RESEARCH CORP.
           (PRC) FOR THE CODE. THIS WAS DEVELOPED AT THE AIR FORCE
           DATA SERVICES CENTER, PENTAGON, WASHINGTON DC WHEN I WORKED
           THERE. IT WAS ONLY DEVELOPED BECAUSE BILL IS SUCH AS GENIUS
           AND DID MORE THAN I COULD EVER DREAM COULD BE DONE.

           CHANGE LOG:  18 MAY 81
           STACK - TSO CMD UPDATED. COMMANDS NO LONGER IN PARENTHESIS.
                   LIST KEYWORD CAN NOT BE SUPPORTED WITH NEW SYNTAX,
                   USE OF STACKL ALIAS PROVIDES EQUAL RESULTS.
                   DELIMITER PAIRS NO LONGER TREATED AS DELIMITERS
                   BUT AS SINGLE CHARACTER THAT MATCHES THE DELIMITER.
                   MAX LENGTH INCREASED FROM 256 TO 1024.

            10 DEC 81

            TSSO,TSSOSSM,TSSOWTO - CAN NOW TYPE IN 2ND COMMAND BEFORE
                 THE 1ST ONE HAS COMPLETED. TSSO WILL QUEUE IT UNTIL
                 THE FIRST COMMAND ENDS.

            10 JAN 82

            WE ARE UP ON MVS/SP1.1.0 AND TSSO WORKS FINE

            11 JUN 82

            NEW WAY TO START TSSO USING NEW PROGRAM TSSOUPSS, SO THAT
            SYSOUT BANNER PAGES WILL SAY TSSO INSTEAD OF SYSOUT.
            TSSO CHANGED TO SUPPORT ENVIRONMENT CREATED BY TSSOUPSS.
            TSSOWTO CHANGED TO SUPPORT SKIPPING ON '.L' COMMAND.
            TSSODOC REWRITTEN. SAMPLE PROCS IN TSSOPROC AND SSSOPROC.
            NEW MEMBER TSSOGIDE IS DOCUMENTATION WITH LOWER CASE
            LETTERS AND ASA CARRIAGE CONTROL. NEW EF COMMAND SYNTAX.
            TSO COMMANDS MAY BE CONTINUED USING HYPHEN AT END OF LINE.
            TSSO '.L' COMMAND MAY BE ENTERED AS JUST 'L', NO PERIOD.

            3 OCT 83

            MVS/XA SUPPORT FOR TSSO. NO REALLY THAT BIG CHANGE. RIC
            WALFORD SENT ME THE ONE CHANGE YOU NEED TO MAKE IN THE
            TSSO MODULE. THE ESTAE FOR MVS/XA HAS CHANGED AND HE FIXED
            THE CODE SO IT WOULD ASSEMBLE CORRECTLY FOR MVS/XA OR NON
            MVS/XA. THANKS TO RIC WHO IS FROM SIMPSON-SEARS LIMITED,
            TORONTO, CANADA.
