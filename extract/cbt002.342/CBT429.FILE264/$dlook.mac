LOOK

This program has its roots in the old DCMS (Dirt Cheap Monitor System)
program package (as was DIDOCS and CSAMON). It has been made a stand-
alone program with its own screen handling.  The basic purpose that it
serves is to provide the ability to display core interactively and
in real time.  To that end it also supports the ability to display any
memory in any address space if it is run authorized.  As an aid to
the programmers that may use it, it will format MVS control blocks
in a semi-reasonable format (in pairs of name suffix, data). The
original version of LOOK requried a generated entry for each item
displayed on the screen.  This seemed an unnecessarily time wasting
and error prone event. A set of macros was written to automate the
generation of the display information necessary from the DSECT expansion
of the real macro. Thus adding a new control block is as easy as
adding 3 statements to the control block module.

I would like to thank the original authors of the DCMS system for
the original idea of LOOK. Any perceived distortions of their intent
was due to my needs.
