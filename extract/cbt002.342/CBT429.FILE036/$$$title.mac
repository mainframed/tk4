           BOB WEINSTEIN'S FIXPDS PROGRAM USING ISPF


    THIS FIXPDS PROGRAM RESTORES DELETED MEMBERS OF A PDS WITH A
BACKWARD SEARCH, STARTING FROM THE END OF THE DATASET AND BROWSING
EACH MEMBER (DELETED OR NOT) WITH ISPF BROWSE.  AFTER ENDING EACH
BROWSE, YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO STOW A NAME IN THE DIRECTORY FOR
THAT MEMBER.  THE PROGRAM PROCEEDS BACKWARDS, MEMBER BY MEMBER, UNTIL
YOU EXIT, OR UNTIL YOU REACH THE BEGINNING OF THE LIBRARY.

    TWO FEATURES DISTINGUISH THIS PROGRAM FROM OTHERS OF THIS TYPE.
ONE, THE MEMBER SEARCH GOES BACKWARDS, STARTING FROM THE END OF THE
DATASET AND GOING BACK, ONE MEMBER AT A TIME.  THIS ALLOWS YOU TO
LOOK AT THE MOST RECENT ACTIVITY FIRST.  TWO, EACH MEMBER IS ISPF
BROWSED.  IT CAN BE EXAMINED IN ITS ENTIRETY, AND IN DETAIL, BEFORE
YOU DECIDE WHETHER TO STOW A DIRECTORY ENTRY FOR IT OR NOT.

    IF YOU DO STOW A DIRECTORY ENTRY, IT DOESN'T MATTER IF ONE ALREADY
EXISTS FOR THAT MEMBER.  THE NEW ONE IS CREATED ALSO.  IF AN OLD ENTRY
WAS THERE TOO, UNDER A DIFFERENT NAME, AN "APPARENT ALIAS" IS CREATED.
USING THE "PDS" PROGRAM (IN CBT TAPE FILE 182), ALL THE APPARENT
ALIASES CREATED CAN BE FLAGGED IN A JIFFY, USING THE "VERIFY" SUBCOMMAND
OF PDS.

    THE PROGRAM WAS WRITTEN BY BOB WEINSTEIN, WHO IN MY BOOK IS A
CERTIFIED GENIUS.  HE WORKS AT AN INSTALLATION IN NEW YORK WHOSE NAME
HE DIDN'T WANT TO MENTION ON THIS FILE.  I'VE BEEN USING THIS PROGRAM
FOR SEVERAL YEARS, AND I RECEIVED HIS PERMISSION TO SUBMIT IT FOR
PUBLIC USE.  YOU CAN DIRECT QUESTIONS TO:
