%   1 +FIXPDS      - Recover deleted PDS members
+
+
+         The fixpds utility allows you to browse the physical
+           members of a PDS from the last one and back,
+           one at a time, regardless of whether a directory
+           entry exists or not.  After exiting the browse,
+           you have the option to enter a new name for the
+           member, and a directory entry will be created for
+           that name.  If you do not enter a name, you will
+           then browse the next member backwards.  If you do
+           enter a name, then after the new directory entry
+           is created, the next member back will be browsed.
+           You have the opportunity to repeat the process.
+           Ending twice causes you to quit execution of the
+           program. %PRESS ENTER TO START.
