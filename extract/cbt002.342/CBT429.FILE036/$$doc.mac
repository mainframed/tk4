            * * *     FIXPDS UTILITY FOR ISPF      * * *


  THIS UTILITY BY BOB WEINSTEIN RESURRECTS DELETED MEMBERS OF A
PDS, BUT IT DOES SO WITHOUT USING THE DIRECTORY (UNLIKE OTHER SUCH
UTILITIES, FOR EXAMPLE PDSGAS FROM CBT TAPE FILE 316, OR THE
RESTORE OPERAND OF THE PDS PROGRAM (FILE 182)).

  I HAVE USED IT TO RESCUE DATASETS WHOSE DIRECTORY HAS BEEN CREAMED.
INSTRUCTIONS FOR DOING THAT ARE IN MEMBER $CREAMED.

  THIS PROGRAM STOWS NEW DIRECTORY ENTRIES FOR PHYSICAL FILES IN A
DATASET WHICH WOULD LOOK LIKE A PDS MEMBER.  IT LOCATES THESE FILES
WITHOUT BENEFIT OF A PREVIOUS GOOD DIRECTORY.  ALL IT NEEDS IS A
BLANK DIRECTORY.  SEE MEMBER $CREAMED FOR INSTRUCTIONS TO OBTAIN
A BLANK DIRECTORY.

  THE PROGRAM RUNS UNDER AN ISPF MENU, AND WHEN IT IS INVOKED, IT
FEELS THE EXTENTS OF THE PDS FOR THE LAST PHYSICAL EOF MARKER.  IT
THEN STEPS BACKWARD AND DOES AN ISPF BROWSE OF THE LAST PHYSICAL
MEMBER.  IF YOU WANT TO STOW A DIRECTORY ENTRY POINTING TO THIS
MEMBER, JUST EXIT FROM THE BROWSE AND A PANEL PROMPTS YOU TO ENTER
THE NAME YOU WANT TO STOW (ADVICE - DON'T ENTER MORE THAN 6
CHARACTERS).  IF YOU ENTER A NAME, A DIRECTORY ENTRY IS CREATED WHICH
POINTS TO THE MEMBER LAST BROWSED.  IF YOU LEAVE THE FIELD BLANK, THE
PROGRAM BACKS UP TO THE NEXT-TO-LAST MEMBER AND REPEATS THE PROCESS
WITHOUT STOWING A NAME.  IN ANY CASE (EVEN AFTER STOWING A NEW NAME)
THE PROGRAM BACKS UP AND BROWSES THE NEXT-TO-LAST PHYSICAL MEMBER.
TO EXIT THE PROGRAM, JUST "END" TWICE.

  I USED THIS UTILITY WHEN A PDS DIRECTORY WAS CLOBBERED.  I HAD WORKED
WITH THAT PDS FOR A WEEK, MAKING 150 UPDATES OR SO.  THE LATEST BACKUP
WAS EIGHT DAYS OLD.  WE RESTORED THE OLD DIRECTORY ONTO THE EXTENTS OF
THE CLOBBERED DIRECTORY, AND I SAVED ALL THE PHYSICAL MEMBERS DOWN TO
THE LEVEL OF THE PREVIOUS BACKUP.  THEN I COPIED THE SAVED MEMBERS TO A
DUPLICATE PDS, MADE FROM THE OLD BACKUP TAPE.  A FEW RENAMINGS LATER,
AND I GOT WHAT I WANTED AND WAS READY TO GO.

  ANOTHER TIME, I WAS DEBUGGING A PROGRAM (IT WAS A VERSION OF CVTCLIST
FROM FILE 187 OF THE CBT TAPE) WHICH RAN OFF INTO AN ENDLESS LOOP WHILE
IN PROCESS OF WRITING MEMBERS TO A PDS.  AFTER THE LOOP WAS ENTERED, NO
NEW DIRECTORY ENTRIES WERE STOWED, SO YOU COULDN'T USE ISPF BROWSE TO
SEE WHAT WAS BEING WRITTEN WHILE THE PROGRAM WAS RUNNING AWAY.  NO
PROBLEM WITH BOB WEINSTEIN'S FIXPDS.  I JUST FIXPDS'ED THE LAST MEMBER
AND BROWSED IT.  I COULD HAVE EVEN BROWSED IT WITHOUT RESTORING IT !!
(OF COURSE I COULD HAVE USED FULL-SCREEN ZAP FROM FILE 300, BUT ISPF
BROWSE GIVES A MUCH BETTER, AND FORMATTED, PICTURE.)
