 To install the ARCHIVER program, in all its glory (?), edit and
 execute the job in member $INSTALL, in the source dataset.  Then
 print the $ARCHDOC member of the source dataset to learn how to use
 it.  Some functions are demonstrated by samples in the SAMPLIB
 dataset as well.

 And remember: this is a freebie to anyone who wants it.  I would be
 interested in hearing (or reading) your comments and experiences and
 will be somewhat receptive to suggestions for improvement.  One user
 who has used the 'BETA' code extensively wants a COMPARE function.
 Interesting.  (in the works)

 My UNLISTED 'phone number is (630) 719-1545 and I do have an
 answering machine.  (Sounds like Groucho Marx, thanks to Radio
 Shack).  I'm home MOST evenings except Thursday, after 6:00 pm
 Central time.

 Fair warning: I hang up on recruiters (head hunters).
