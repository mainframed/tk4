)F FUNCTION -
     The $SPACE command may be used to report the space utilisation
     of data sets residing on direct access devices at a specified
     level of index in an OS, VSAM or ICF catalog. VSAM data sets in
     VSAM catalogs and DFHSM migrated data sets are not currently
     supported.

))LEVEL(index-name)
     specifies the level of index at which data sets are to be reported.
     The default is the user prefix, as specified in the user's profile,
     or, if this is null, userid.
))OUTDATASET(data-set-name)
     specifies a physical sequential (PS) data set to which the report
     is to be directed, instead of to the terminal. The data set will
     be created if it does not already exist.
))PRINT
     specifies that utilisation figures are to be displayed for
     individual data sets, as well as utilisation totals
))NOPRINT
     specifies that only total utilisation figures are to be displayed
))CREDT(nnnn)
     specifies that only data sets created more than nnnn days ago
     (range 0-9999) are to be reported
))REFDT(nnnn)
     specifies that only data sets last referenced more than nnnn days
     ago (range 0-9999) are to be reported
