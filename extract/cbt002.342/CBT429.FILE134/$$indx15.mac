  THIS IS THE FIFTEENTH SHIPMENT OF FILE 134 - DATED JULY 1994.
           (MY INTERNET ID IS:   GPRICE@OZEMAIL.COM.AU  )


FIRSTLY -  REVIEW   - RELEASE 21.
           CHECK THE CHANGE LOG IN THE LEADING SOURCE
           COMMENTS OF MEMBER 'REVIEW' FOR CHANGES.
           THE MAIN THING IS THE ADDITION OF THE 'ALL' OPERAND TO
           ALL OF THE 'FIND' AND 'FINDNOT' FAMILY OF SUBCOMMANDS.
           NOTE THE EFFECT THIS HAS ON 'CUTOFF'/'APPEND' (IE.
           EXCLUDED RECORDS ARE NOT CUT).
           ALSO NOTE WHICH SUBCOMMANDS PRESERVE THE "ALL" STATUS
           AND WHICH RESET IT (INCLUDING THE NEW 'RESET'/'RES'
           SUBCOMMAND).
           ALSO ALSO NOTE THAT "ISPF 3278T" IS NOW THE DEFAULT
           TERMINAL DISPLAY MODE WHENEVER GRAPHICS ESCAPE IS
           SUPPORTED.

           TSO HELP MEMBERS HEL# AND REVIEW# ALSO UPDATED.


SECONDLY - EDBOX, EDPRT, EDUNBOX, EDUNPRT.
           THESE FOUR ISPF EDIT MACROS FROM DAVID PRICE OF THE EITC
           (FORMERLY PART OF THE SECV (AND I DON'T MEAN THE ACF2 CICS
           ABEND CODE OF THE SAME NAME)) PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR CONVERTING
           VARIOUS THINGS LIKE CONTINIOUS-LINE BOXES TO AND FROM
           "STANDARD" DISPLAYS AND "TEXT" DISPLAYS.  "TEXT" DISPLAYS
           ARE SUPPORTED BY ISPF AS TERMINAL TYPE "3278T".  IBM USES
           "TEXT" CHARACTERS (LIKE IN THE TN AND T11 PRINT TRAINS)
           IN SYNTAX DIAGRAMS IN ESA MACRO COMMENTS AND TSO/E HELP
           MEMBERS.  ANY TERMINAL WITH GRAPHIC ESCAPE SUPPORT (WHICH
           INCLUDES MOST 3270 SCREENS MADE IN THE LAST TEN YEARS)
           CAN USE DISPLAY TYPE 3278T UNDER ISPF.


THIRDLY  - NOTHING.  THERE IS NO THIRD THING.

           (WELL, I DIDN'T EXPECT THE SPANISH INQUISITION....)
