  THIS IS THE THIRD SHIPMENT OF FILE 134 - DATED JULY 1990.
  ALTERATIONS THIS TIME ARE:


$CRYPT   - OBJECT DECK CREATED BY DELINK0 NOW SUPPLIED IN THIS FILE.
           LEX EREMIN'S UNCRACKABLE (PRETTY WELL) ENCRYPT/DECRYPT TSO
           COMMAND.  USER CAN SUPPLY A PASSWORD (UP TO 4 BYTES LONG)
           THAT IS USED AS A KEY.  ONLY USE ON FIXED LENGTH RECORDS.
           NEEDS ABOUT 5 CHARS THE SAME (TOGETHER) IN THE FIRST RECORD
           TO STORE THE KEY (ENCRYPTED, OF COURSE!).  USES QSAM.
           NO SPECIAL LINK EDIT PARMS ('NCAL,MAP,LIST' IS OKAY).
           USE:      ALIAS $DECRYPT
                     ALIAS $ENCRYPT
                     NAME $CRYPT(R)
           MUST RUN AS A TSO COMMAND - EASILY DRIVEN FROM TSD UTILITIES
           (OPTION "U") ALTHOUGH OF COURSE IT WORKS FROM "READY" MODE.
           (ONLY THE LOAD MODULE WAS SHIPPED PREVIOUSLY.)
CLRSCRN  - OBJECT DECK OF SUBROUTINE USED IN "PROGRAM".
DCPU     - A BUG FOR MP CPU UTILIZATION WAS FIXED.
DIVER    - OBJECT DECK CREATED BY DELINK0 NOW SUPPLIED IN THIS FILE.
           NO SPECIAL LINK EDIT PARMS ('NCAL,MAP,LIST' IS OKAY).
           THE ZAP MENTIONED IN $$INDEX STILL APPLIES, SO RELAX.
LISTVOL  - SEVERAL PARSING CHANGES MEANING THAT 'LISTV ALL' NOW
           WORKS UNDER ISPF (HOORAY!!) AND VOLUME SERIAL NUMBERS (OR
           PREFIXES THEREOF) CAN BE SPECIFIED IN A LIST.  FOR EXAMPLE,
           TO LIST ALL DB2 AND TSO VOLUMES ENTER: 'LISTV (TSO DB2)'
LISTVOL$ - (NEW.)  JCL TO ASSEMBLE AND LINK LISTVOL.
PROGRAM  - THE WIZARD HAS RELENTED AND DECRYPTED THE SOURCE.
R062A10  - OBJECT DECK OF SUBROUTINE USED IN "PROGRAM".
REVIEW   - CHECK THE CHANGE LOG FOR THE APRIL AND LATER ENTRIES.
           BEST BIT IS IMBEDDED INDEX RECORDS IN DATA COMPONENTS
           NOW SEEM TO BE IGNORED CORRECTLY.  3390 "FASTPATH" SUPPORT
           ALSO ADDED.
REVIEW@  - UPDATED WITH MORE DOCO INCLUDING SMF FORMATTING DETAILS.
REVSMF   - TYPE 09,10,11 - AVOID S0C4 IF ZERO DEVICES.
           (GET A TYPE 11 WITH ZERO DEVICES EVERY NOW AND THEN AFTER
            A CONFIG OFF OPERATOR COMMAND UNDER PR/SM.)
           TIGHTEN RMF RECORD VALIDATION (ONLY XA AND ESA SUPPORTED).
           TYPE 30 - FORMAT EXCP SECTIONS WHEN SCROLLING RIGHT.
           TYPE 73 - SHOW CHANNEL UTLIZATION
                   - 1 CHANNEL PER SCROLL RIGHT PAGE.
           TYPE 74 - SHOW DEVICE ACTIVATION RATE AND RESPONSE TIME
                   - 1 DEVICE PER SCROLL RIGHT PAGE.
           MANY LITERALS ARE NOW IN LOWER CASE TO HIGHLIGHT THE FACT
           THAT THEY ARE GENERATED BY REVSMF AND SINCE THEY ARE NOT
           PART OF THE SMF RECORD THEY ARE NOT USEFUL FIND COMMAND
           ARGUMENTS.
SHOWDS   - 3390 SUPPORT ADDED.  SHOW A COUPLE MORE SMS FIELDS.
SUPERLST - (ALL THOSE MEMBERS BEGINNING WITH 'X'.)
           3380-K AND 3390 SUPPORT ADDED, BUT I HAVE NO 3390 UNITS
           TO TEST IT WITH.  3380-K HAD EXTENTS OVER 32K TRACKS IN
           SIZE AND THIS NOW WORKS CORRECTLY.  (RVR MAY GIVE ME A
           SUPERIORLY UPDATED VERSION LATER.)
TERMTEST - MORE DETAILS DECODED FROM QUERY RESPONSE AND DISPLAYED
           IN MAIN PANEL.  RUN-TIME LOGIC HAS BEEN ENHANCED TO NO
           LONGER RELY UPON 14-BIT ADDRESSABILITY AVAILABILITY AND
           TO GREATLY IMPROVE SCREEN SIZE INDEPENDENCE.  JUST NOTE
           THAT THE OLD 24 BY 80 IS STILL THE SMALLEST SCREEN SIZE
           SUPPORTED.  FORMAT 1 PS LOAD (9 BY 16 MATRIX) CAN LOAD
           THE TOP 16 ROWS OF 3472 9 BY 23 CHARACTER MATRICES QUITE
           SUCCESSFULLY, BUT BAD LUCK IF YOU WANT CONTINUOUS COLOUR
           ACROSS ADJACENT SCREEN LINES (ON THE 3472, THAT IS).


           WITH "PROGRAM" DECODED, AND "R062A10", "DIVER", "CLRSCRN"
           AND "$CRYPT" OBJECT DECKS, ALL LOAD MODULES IN FILE 135 CAN
           NOW BE RECREATED FROM FILE 134.
