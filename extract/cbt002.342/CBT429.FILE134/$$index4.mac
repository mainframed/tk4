  THIS IS THE FOURTH SHIPMENT OF FILE 134 - DATED DECEMBER 1990.
  ALTERATIONS THIS TIME ARE:


DUPTIME  - (NEW.)  AN OLD FAVOURITE NOW CALLIBRATED CORRECTLY AND ALSO
           SHOWS SYSTEM ID.  MAY BE GOOD IN A LOGON CLIST FOR SYSTEM
           VERIFICATION.  USES TPUT OR WTO AS APPROPRIATE.
           ALSO, A JOB NAME CAN BE SPECIFIED AS PARAMETER OR OPERAND
           TO GET THE SRM TRANSACTION RESIDIENT TIME FOR THAT JOB STEP.
           FOR NON-SWAPPABLE JOBS, THIS WILL BE THE UP-TIME OF THEM,
           SO YOU CAN TELL HOW LONG THINGS LIKE DB2 AND IMS HAVE BEEN
           UP.  DBA-ERS MAY WANT TO KNOW IF THE NEXT TRANSACTIONS
           WILL BE THE FIRST AND CAUSE THREE HUNDRED TABLES TO BE
           ALLOCATED AND OPENED.  USE AN ASTERISK FOR ALL ASIDS.
MONO     - (NEW.)  MONOPOLY (LOAD MODULE ONLY).  BEFORE CALLING ISSUE:
           ALLOC FILE(SYSOUT) DA(*)
SMFJBTIM - PHASES THAT TAKE NEGATIVE TIME ARE NOW DEEMED TO TAKE ZERO
           TIME SO AS NOT TO THROW AVERAGES OFF TOO MUCH.  NEGATIVE
           DURATIONS OCCUR IN A JES2 MAS COMPLEX WITH LOOSELY COUPLED
           SYSTEMS THAT DO NOT HAVE THEIR T-O-D CLOCKS SYNCHRONIZED
           AND A JOB HAS DIFFERENT PHASES OF PROCESSING DONE BY
           DIFFERENT SYSTEMS.
