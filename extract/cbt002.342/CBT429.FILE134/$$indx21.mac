  THIS IS THE TWENTY-FIRST SHIPMENT OF FILE 134 - DATED SEPTEMBER 1997.
           (MY INTERNET ID IS:   GPRICE@OZEMAIL.COM.AU  )


GRPSTR   - UIDSTR FOR RACF.  TSO COMMAND FOR CLISTS WHICH
           PLACES THE USER'S RACF GROUP INTO AN 8-BYTE
           CLIST VARIABLE CALLED (STRANGELY ENOUGH) GRPSTR.


MSGASIDX - MPF EXIT TO ADD 12 BYTES TO MESSAGE TEXT:
           ' - ASID ####' WHERE #### IS THE HEX ASID.
           WE USE IT FOR IEF403I SO THAT WHEN AN INITIATOR
           GETS FRAGMENTED STORAGE WE CAN TELL WHICH JOBS
           USED THAT ADDRESS SPACE, BUT IT COULD BE USED
           FOR PRACTICALLY ANY MESSAGE.


REVIEW   - RELEASE 29.1.

           LEAVE AUTHORIZATION BLANK FOR PROGRAMS WITH NO
           APF SECTION.  THIS IS TO ELIMINATE THE MISLEADING
           ?? IN THE AC CODE COLUMN FOR PROGRAM OBJECTS.
           (IT IS NOT AN ERROR CONDITION.)

           RELEASE 29.0.
           CHECK THE CHANGE LOG IN THE LEADING SOURCE
           COMMENTS OF MEMBER 'REVIEW' FOR CHANGES.

           MADE 'FIND'/'F'/'FINDNOT'/'FN' CASE INSENSITIVE SO IT
           USES 4 TIMES THE CPU OF 'FINDCHR'/'FC'/'FCN' WHICH
           REMAINS CASE SENSITIVE.

           ADDED 'FINDPIC'/'FP'/'FPN' WHICH ALLOW THE USUAL ISPF
           PICTURE MASKING CHARACTERS.

           EG. FIND RECORDS LONGER THAN 60 COLUMNS WITH:
           FP = 61 ALL

           EG. COPY ALL RECORDS SHORTER THAN 40 COLUMNS WITH:
           FPN = 40 ALL
           CUT SHORTS
               ASSUMING SHORTS WAS PREALLOCATED TO A SEQUENTIAL FILE.

           EG. FIND ALL RECORDS WITHOUT SEQUENCE NUMBERS FROM
               THE CURRENT SCREEN TO END-OF-FILE WITH:
           FPN ######## 73 REST

           FULL ACCESS TO FIND FACILITES IS AVAILABLE FROM THE
           MEMBER LIST TO SCAN ALL OR PART OF A PDS OR PDSE.
           MATCHING MEMBERS ARE TAGGED IN THE MEMBER LIST.

           USE '=HELP' IN THE LOCATE INPUT FIELD OF THE MEMBER
           LIST DISPLAY TO SEE MEMBER LIST SUBCOMMANDS.

           POINT-AND-SHOOT USES THE ISPF INTERNAL BUFFER UNDER
           MVS/ESA AND LATER TO SUPPORT ISPF 4.3 UNDER OS/390.
           (READ BUFFER TECHNIQUE WORKED FOR ISPF 4.2 UNDER SP5.2.2.)

           PREVENT ACF2 USERS FROM HOGGING A FILE WHEN THEY ARE
           NOT AUTHORIZED TO REVIEW IT (FOR NON-VSAM, ANYWAY).
