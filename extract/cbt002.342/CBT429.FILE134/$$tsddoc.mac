 NOTES

   The ISPF interface is substantially the way it was when Lex Eremin
   left i.e. incomplete. It has a number of installation dependencies
   in terms of data set and program names.

   You will have some difficulty, I think, when using it for the first
   time, in that it expects to find a member of the ISPF profile data
   set corresponding to the NEWAPPL defined in ISR@PRIM. (At least it
   does on our system - this may be an ISPF Version 2 Release 2 bug).
   Copying ISRPROF, ISREDIT and ISREDRT members to (say) TSDPROF,
   TSDEDIT and TSDEDRT seems to overcome this.

   The generic locate in module SKJ$LC02 now uses an extended work area
   (with fullword length and offset fields). Storage for the catalog
   work area is acquired above the 16MB line. The initial catalog work
   area size is set to 32K, which is enough for about 725 entries at 45
   bytes a pop. A return code of 44 from the generic locate is treated
   as an error. An additional flag is defined to prevent a loop if the
   return code from the generic locate is 40 (work area too small).

   There are a number of changes in this release (some of which may
   preclude the program from working in environments prior to MVS/ESA).
   . The program now executes AMODE(31). However, for various reasons -
     DCB/DCBE, DCB exit, IKJEFF02 parameter list - it remains RMODE(24).
   . Buffers for the QSAM locate mode I/O to the output data set reside
     above 16MB (a DCBE is supplied, specifying RMODE31=BUFF).
   . System-determined block size support - the default block size for
     the output data set is now set at 0.
   . The current date is determined using a LINKAGE=SYSTEM form of the
     TIME macro.
   . Creation date and last reference date logic is now Y2K-compliant
     (until 2155, anyway).
   . The catalog work area is acquired/released above 16MB, using the
     STORAGE macro rather than GETMAIN/FREEMAIN. See also the comments
     above about other changes to the catalog management interface.
