  THIS IS THE FOURTEENTH SHIPMENT OF FILE 134 - DATED MAY 1994.


REVIEW   - RELEASE 20.  CHECK THE CHANGE LOG IN THE LEADING SOURCE
           COMMENTS OF MEMBER 'REVIEW' FOR CHANGES.
           THE MAIN THING IS THE ADDITION OF THE 'APPEND' AND 'CUTOFF'
           SUBCOMMANDS WHICH ALLOW THE DATA BEING REVIEWED TO BE
           COPIED TO A SEQUENTIAL (QSAM) FILE.
           SO WHAT?
           SO IF YOU GET AN I/O ERROR YOU CAN 'NEWTOP' AFTER THE ERROR
           TO REVIEW DATA WHICH IS UNAVAILABLE BY CONVENTIONAL MEANS.
           WITH THESE NEW SUBCOMMANDS YOU CAN NOW COPY THIS DATA
           FOR LATER DATA RECLAMATION.
           ANOTHER CHANGE OF MINOR IMPORTANCE IS THE ABILITY OF
           '=SEQLOAD' TO SEQUENTIALIZE THE DATA OF MEMBERS INTO A
           FILE WITH A RECORD LENGTH LESS THAN 80.

           TSO HELP MEMBERS HEL# AND REVIEW# ALSO UPDATED.


$$IEFU83 - ALTERED THE IEFU83 EXIT TO HIGHLIGHT POOR BLOCKING FOR
           VARIABLE LENGTH RECORDS WHEN WRITTEN BY QSAM PUT LOCATE MODE.
           IF YOU LET U83*15I MESSAGES (TO SEE WHAT THE * CHARACTER IS
           LOOK AT THE SOURCE) GO TO THE SYSLOG (FOR A DAY EVEN) THEN
           YOU CAN DO A "FIND BLKNG" COMMAND WHEN BROWSING THE SYSLOG
           TO SEE WHICH BATCH JOBS WRITE UNBLOCKED FILES DUE TO THE
           MECHANICS OF PUT LOCATE.  NEW READY-TO-USE LOAD MODULE FOR
           XA AND LATER (AT LEAST TO 4.3) IS SHIPPED IN CBT FILE 135.


LISTICAT - A VERSION OF JIM LANE'S PACKAGE FROM CBT FILE 047.
           BEEN HERE A WHILE BUT I HAVEN'T MENTIONED IT YET.
           THIS VERSION HAS THE EDICAT ISPF EDIT MACRO TO ALLOW
           RECATALOGING OF FILES IF THE CATALOG IS LOST.
           EDICAT CONVERTS LISTICAT OUTPUT TO IDCAMS DEFINE STATEMENTS.
           EDICAT SUPPORTS VSAM AND NON-VSAM CATALOG ENTRIES.
           EDICAT USES FEATURES OF THIS VERSION OF LISTICAT
           (CONTINUATION LINE PROCESSING, MULTIPLE VOLUMES, ETC.)
           WHICH ARE NOT IN THE FILE 047 VERSION.
           WE USE LISTICAT TO BACKUP ALL CATALOG ENTRIES OF TAPE DATA
           SETS EVERY NIGHT.  IN A DRP SCENARIO A WEEK-END SNAPSHOT OF
           THE SYSTEM IS RESTORED AND ALL TAPE DATA SET CATALOG ENTRIES
           ARE BROUGHT UP TO DATE USING EDICAT AND IDCAMS.  WE DON'T
           WANT THE CATALOGS RESTORED AS A WHOLE BECAUSE THEY MUST
           REMAIN IN SYNC WITH DATA ON THE DASD VOLUMES.  THAT IS,
           WE ONLY WANT TAPE DATA SET CATALOG ENTRIES BROUGHT UP-TO-
           DATE, NOT THE ENTRIES OF DISK DATA SETS.  WITH LISTICAT
           WE DO NOT HAVE TO USE SEPARATE USER CATALOGS OR HIGH-LEVEL
           QUALIFIERS.
