This is REVIEW Release 30.0.

REVIEW is a 3270 fullscreen TSO command processor for MVS.
REVIEW also functions correctly under TSS on MSP systems.

This ZIP file contains:

1 - REVHELP.XMI which is TSO HELP data.
2 - REVLOAD.XMI which is the load module.

To install unZIP and (binary) transfer both files to your MVS system.
The MVS data sets should both have fixed-length 80-byte records.
Then use TSO/E RECEIVE with the INDATASET operand to convert them to
"normal" partitioned data sets.

Copy the HELP members to your TSO HELP library.
Copy the load modules to your load library, preferably in the link list.

I'm sure I don't need to say anything about copying aliases and the
finer points of using ISPF option 3.3, do I?
(This means that in ISPF option 3.3 copy all real members to be
copied, then copy all aliases to be copied before hitting END.
Otherwise, "orphan" aliases and wasted disk space can result.)

The source for REVIEW is available on the CBT MVS tape,
and is in the public domain, as is the data contained herein.

If you wish to be added or removed from the "REVIEW" update auto-ship
list then please email the address below.  You may also request a copy
of the latest source to be sent via email.  Bug reports welcome.

Enjoy.  GP@GE

R26.0 notes:

This release has built-in support for the FSHELP and FSH aliases of HEL,
and includes the new 'FORMAT"/'FMT' and 'FMTVAR'/'FV' subcommands.
Note also that '=X' and '=CAN' are now valid member list subcommands.


R27.0 notes:

This release allows PDS searching with '=SEARCH' from the directory list
Use '=HELP' to see what is available from the directory list.
REMEMBER - if any members are tagged then only these members will be
searched (or offloaded).  Use '=RESET' to untag all members.


R28.0 notes:

This release introduces the "point-and-shoot" capability
which is triggered by invoking REVIEW with no operands.
REVIEW does a read buffer to get the DSNAME under the
cursor.  This works from the TSO READY prompt (except
for Session Manager which updates the screen before
REVIEW gets control) and in fullscreen mode.

For best results under ISPF, set up a PF key with
         TSO REV) MODE(FSCR
exactly as shown above.

You also may wish to set up a REVIEW PF key with
         TSO REV
to allow point-and-shoot recursive REVIEWs.

Note that a recursive REVIEW with no operands is
terminated unless a point-and-shoot DSNAME is found.
This is to avoid TSO prompting with no ability to
interrupt out of it.

Also note that for point-and-shoot purposes, a
member name is NOT considered to be part of a DSNAME.

R28.1 allows the S member selection code even for
same-named members in a concatenation.

R28.2 restores the terminal to line mode when
"point 'n' shoot" can't process a data set.
Also, PF5/17 can now find the first member in
a member list if it is tagged.

R29.0 makes the FIND, F and FINDNOT subcommands case insensitive.
FINDCHR, FC and FCN remain case sensitive.
FINDPIC, FP and FPN have been added.  eg. FP ###  looks for 3 digits.
These commands can all be selected from the member list to search
the whole file (one or more PDSs).
A RACROUTE is now issued for non-pre-allocated non-VSAM data sets on
ACF2 systems to avoid leaving a data set allocated after a S913 abend.
(OPEN ABEND EXIT processing handles this for RACF systems since R26.0.)
The screen buffer has been enlarged so that REVIEW may now actually
work on a 62 by 160 screen (logic added 4 and a half years ago).

R29.1 no longer displays ?? under AC for unauthorized program objects.

R29.2 fixes case insensitive searches with ASCII ON.  Picture searches
are not allowed with ASCII ON.  Case insensitivity is ignored if there
are no alphabetics in the search argument, thus speeding up searches.
=SEARCH status indicators are improved.

R29.3 fixes ZAP IDR formatting when ESDID values are invalid.

R29.4 fixes recursion detection, fixes searching for data specified
with no trailing quote, and allows the use of double-quotes for
quoting strings.  Eg. FIND "=C'FRED',"

R29.5 enhances DEBUG output for diagnosis purposes.

R29.6 fixes 2 possible S0C4 problems with unexpectedly long input,
and allows finding a quote character.  Eg. FIND '    and FIND "

Note that REVSMF has minor updates for formatting CICS and STOTEK
silo (SLSS) SMF records.

R29.7 fixes SUB.  (SUBMIT still worked.)

R29.8 fixes RDW handling for non-VSAM DSECT formatting.

Note that REVSMF can extract some WLM service class statistics
from type 72 subtype 3 RMF SMF records.

R29.9 fixes an error handling QUERY TGET data lengths longer than 256
bytes.  The extra data length overlaid the display translate table
which caused corrupted data display and sometimes caused terminal
errors requiring TSO session cancellation.  (The reported observation
was with CM/2 terminal emulation under OS/2.)  And now a word about
IDRs in load modules:
     Data from IDRs is formatted when REVIEWing associated CESD
     blocks (when scrolled right past the block itself) and when
     REVIEWING the IDRs themselves.  Translation and User IDRs
     are each a single logical record which can be spanned over
     many physical records.  For these 2 types only the last entry
     is formatted so that for simple load modules with few CSECTS
     you do not have to scroll right much, if at all.  For load
     modules with many CSECTs it is best to view the CESDs to get
     translation and IDENTIFY details pertaining to each ESD.  This
     data comes from the IDRs located after the CESDs.  Therefore
     the data can only be displayed if scrolling down to these IDRs
     has occurred.  For simple load modules the first screenful is
     usually sufficient, while for the nucleus, for example, one has
     to scroll down hundreds of lines before scrolling up again to
     get the formatted data.  (Caching of records does not occur in
     pre-XA systems so only data from blocks on the screen can be
     formatted.)  Only one ESD per CESD record is formatted per
     page, so left/right scrolling across a 15-page area is required
     to see all formatted ESDs in a many-CSECTed program (because
     a CESD can have data about up to 15 ESDs).  (Individual ZAP
     IDR entries are formatted 2 to a page, and also use left/right
     scrolling to access different entries.)  R29.9 fixes a logic
     error formatting IDR data for ESD entries.  After the screen
     records were processed the last screen record was processed
     again from cache, upsetting the assembly of the logical record.
     A design capacity limitation is still evident when looking at
     a couple of programs from SYS1.LINKLIB (such as ARCCTL) causing
     display errors when many (hundreds) CSECTs were compiled in the
     same compilation run.  This is not a problem for the nucleus.
     The link edit IDR is a fixed-length fixed-format record formatted
     by REVIEW.  OW29593 adds 4 bytes (the time in packed decimal) to
     it.  R29.9 should now format this IDR layout also.  Since the
     binder "name" is in plain text, the name will be replaced by the
     HH:MM:SS of the bind when the data of this extended IDR is broken
     out.
R29.9 should also fix a couple of bugs in formatting IMS details.
Personally, I blame bitrot to code not tested in 10 years.

R30.0 adds "jump from leader dots" where a member can be selected
by placing the cursor on a member list dot without actually typing
the S member selection code.  A VTOC can now be REVIEWed by specifying
the quoted data set name 'FORMAT4.DSCB' and supplying a volume serial
number with the VOLUME operand.  While REVIEWing a VTOC the format-1
DSCBs can be formatted with the FORMAT ON subcommand.  Support for the
logical PARMLIB service of OS/390 1.2 (and later) is accessed by a
request to REVIEW the PARMLIB file when no PARMLIB file is allocated.
(ie. REV PARMLIB F)

R30.1 fixes a bug where issuing a command RECALL on a wide screen
caused all data except the recalled command to be cleared from the
screen.  This was caused by calculating the buffer start address
for the wide screen, but leaving the end address for an 80-column
screen.  This made the end address less than the start address, so
an attempt to clear the primary input area cleared to the end of the
screen and wrapped around to clear the top of the screen.

R30.2 fixes a S0C4 abend caused by an incorrect attempt to restore
the primary command in the TSO ECT after a HELP session had ended.
This was most obvious on recursive HELPs with missing HELP data.
