           The whole REVIEW package is now updated to Release 32.0.
Feb, 2000: The whole REVIEW package is now updated to Release 32.1.
Feb, 2000: IMS ACBLIB: fixed code bitrot, added Y2K windowing for sort.

REVIEW   - Updated with subroutine CSECTs split off to new source
  &        member REVSUBS (in order to improve response time in
REVSUBS    the ol' ISPF edit sessions, and reduce disk space
           consumption for each save).

           Main new features are

       1 - Format ZIP file directories.
           (Any C coder heroes out there who would be prepared to
           donate a bit of programming time to get UNZIP working?
           If so, email me.)

       2 - Render images from ZSoft Paintbrush files (usual low-level
           qualifier is PCX) with 1-bit (black-and-white), 4-bit (up
           to 16 colours) or 8-bit (up to 256 colours) single-plane
           colour pictures on 3270 graphics terminals.  Base GDDM
           functions may be dynamically invoked to use vector graphics
           via the System Programmer Interface (ie. no GDDM modules
           are link-edited with REVIEW).

           Paintbrush PCX files were chosen because they are top-down
           (BMPs are usually bottom-up) and the limited-RLE compression
           is so simple that even I can understand it.  Also, the header
           has a fixed-length format which contains all necessary data
           to perform file validation after the first read.  I'd welcome
           any logic or code donations to enable the decoding of other
           picture file formats.

           If you find Paintbrush itself does not seem to save the files
           in a format understood by REVIEW, I'd recommend getting
           PMView (www.pmview.com) for Windows or OS/2 to transform the
           file from BMP to PCX - remembering to keep the colour depth
           to a minimum to keep the file size to a minimum.

           Sample PCX files to test REVIEW picture rendering:

REVPCX01 - 80 by 80 pel black-and-white earth globe.
REVPCX02 - 80 by 80 pel colour earth globe.
REVPCX03 - 512 by 256 pel black-and-white map of the world.
REVPCX04 - 512 by 256 pel colour map of the world.
REVPCX05 - A black-and-white cartoon.
REVPCX06 - A colour cartoon.
REVPCX07 - Part of a NaSPA award (colour) (rotated to fit on screen).


TERMTEST - Now at Release 11.1 to fix a bug which caused a S0C4
           abend under Tom Brennan's Vista TN3270 product during
           initialization (processing the Query response).
           (Come on, Tom, how about some 3270 graphics?  :)
