  THIS IS THE SECOND SHIPMENT OF FILE 134 - DATED FEBRUARY 1990.
  ALTERATIONS SINCE THIS FILE WAS FIRST SHIPPED ARE:

  TSO FULLSCREEN PROGRAMS ISSUING QUERIES NOW CHECK FOR A PC
  ATTACHMENT FACILITY SUBFIELD AND MAY TAKE SOME ACTION.

#PDSTBL  - (NEW.)  PDS 8.3 SOURCE MEMBER COPIED FROM FILE 182.
           FLAG BYTES FOR 'PRINTOFF' AND 'REVIEW' WERE ALTERED SO
           THAT UNDER 'PDS' OF A PDS (CALLED, SAY, 'PDS.NAME')
           "PRINTOFF :"         ISSUES       PRINTOFF 'PDS.NAME'
                                  AND
           "REVIEW :"           ISSUES       REVIEW 'PDS.NAME'
           INSTEAD OF PROCESSING EVERY MEMBER INDIVIDUALLY.
           ALSO, 'REVIEW' PDS SUBCOMMANDS INVALIDATE BLDL RESULTS
           SINCE ISPF EDIT CAN BE SELECTED FROM REVIEW.
@PRINTO  - (NEW.)  PDS 8.3 SOURCE MEMBER COPIED FROM FILE 182.
           CHANGED TO HANDLE THE ABOVE CHANGES TO 'PRINTOFF' AND
           'REVIEW' PDS SUBCOMMANDS.  (LOOK FOR 'GP DEC89' FOR MODS.)
ABEND    - ANOTHER FIFTY OR SO LINES TYPED IN JUST FOR THE HEL OF IT.
HEL      - (NEW.)  PINCHED DIRECTLY FROM FILE 296 AND FIXED SOME THINGS
           THAT BUGGED ME.  USE "FIND '1' 80" TO LOCATE CHANGES.
HEL$     - (NEW.)  INSTALL JCL FOR 'HEL'.
HEL#     - (NEW.)  TSO HELP MEMBER FOR THIS 'HEL'.
REVIEW   - CHECK THE CHANGE LOG.  CHANGES FROM OCTOBER 1989 AND LATER
           ARE NEW WITH THIS RESHIP.
REVIEW$  - CHANGED THE LINK EDIT TO SUPPLY THE 'REVVSAM' ALIAS WHICH IS
           INTENDED TO BE APF AUTHORIZED UNDER MVS/ESA.
REVIEW#  - RESYNCHRONIZED WITH THIS SHIPMENT OF 'REVIEW'.
REVIEW@  - (NEW.)
           DOCUMENTATION TO HELP USERS EXPLOIT 'REVIEW' INTERNAL LOGIC.
REVSMF   - TYPE 70 - SHOW CPU UTILIZATION UNDER PR/SM.
           TYPE 07 - CORRECT OFFSET OF "FROM" DATE.
SNAKE    - PC/PS2 QUERY RESULTS FORCE IBM DATA STREAMS EVEN UNDER A
           NON-IBM OPERATING SYSTEM.
SNAKE$   - (NEW.)  JCL TO INSTALL SNAKE.
WORM     - PC/PS2 QUERY RESULTS FORCE IBM DATA STREAMS EVEN UNDER A
           NON-IBM OPERATING SYSTEM AS WELL AS USE OF THE OR SIGN ('×')
           FOR VERTICAL LINES INSTEAD OF THE APL CODE POINT X'85'.
           (THE PS2'S I HAVE WORKED ON DO NOT HAVE THE FULL APL
           CHARACTER SET EVEN THOUGH THE QUERY REPONSE SAYS GE CAN BE
           USED.  BUT THEN THEY DON'T RETURN A PCAF SUBFIELD EITHER.)
WORM$    - (NEW.)  JCL TO INSTALL WORM.
SVMDSSU  - (NEW.)  FRONT END TO DF/DSS TO BACKUP VM VOLUMES UNDER MVS.
           (OPS PREFERRED THE DSS JOB PRINTOUT FOR HISTORICAL DOCO
           RATHER THAN THE VM UTILITY'S.  (I THINK IT WAS "DDR".))
           WE PUT PHONY OS VTOC ON LAST TRACK.  IT HAD ONE DATA SET
           COVERING ALL DISK SPACE.  MAKE DSORG=DA FOR BEST RESULTS.
           SHOULD HAVE USED SECOND TRACK ON VOLUME (CYL 0 TRK 1) SO
           IT WOULD THEN HAVE BEEN DEVICE INDEPENDENT (VM ONLY USES
           TRK 0 OF CYL 0 - REST OF CYL 0 IS REALLY WASTED).  WE HAD
           LAST CYL IN VM DIR AS $OS-VTOC$ SO PHONY OS VTOC WOULD
           NOT GET OVER-WRITTEN.  THE 3380 REFERRED TO IN COMMENTS
           IS SINGLE-DENSITY ONLY SO WATCH IT.  (OKAY FOR E'S AND K'S
           IF YOU USE CYL 884 AND NOT LAST CYL.)  FOR MINI-DISK
           RESTORE, JUST WORK OUT THE CYLINDERS INVOLVED AND RESTORE
           THEM.  THE TRICKY BIT WAS TO GET THE OS VTOC IN THE FIRST
           PLACE.  WE DID A DSF QUICK/MINIMAL INIT AND THEN COPIED
           ACROSS ALL THE VM DISK EXCEPT THE VTOC TRACK TO THE DSF'D
           DISK.
VMUCBZAP - (NEW.)  MUCH THE SAME AS ABOVE EXCEPT THAT IT WAS NOT
           SPECIFICALLY A FRONT END TO ANYTHING.  LETS YOU BROWSE/
           REVIEW/ZAP OR WHATEVER VM MINIDISKS FROM MVS.  ASSUMES PHONY
           OS VTOC ON LAST TRACK AGAIN, AND ONLY SUPPORTS 3350S, BUT
           THEN YOU CAN CHANGE IT, CAN'T YOU?
TERMTEST - PC/PS2 QUERY RESULTS FORCE IBM DATA STREAMS EVEN UNDER A
           NON-IBM OPERATING SYSTEM.
           THE 'PUNCHX' SUBCOMMAND HAS BEEN ADDED.

             TERMTEST TALK
             ======== ====
             THE TERMTEST SYMBOL EDITOR IS DESIGNED FOR DINKY-DI
           MAINFRAME TERMINALS AND NOT RINKY-TINKY PC IMITATIONS.
           AS A RESULT IT ONLY SUPPORTS LOAD PS DATA FORMAT TYPE 1
           WHICH IMPLIES A 9 BY 16 DOT MATRIX FOR A CHARACTER.
           IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE TO ALTER IT TO 8 BY 10 OR 10 BY 8 OR
           WHATEVER YOUR PC OR PS2 USES, SO WHY ISN'T IT?  (LAUGH HERE.)
             THE 'PUNCH' SUBCOMMAND PRODUCES ASSEMBLER SOURCE CARD
           IMAGES (TO DDNAME=SYSPUNCH) OF THE SYMBOLS USING BINARY
           DECLARATIONS TAKING FIVE CARD IMAGES PER SYMBOL.  THIS MAKES
           IT EASIER FOR HUMANS TO RELATE THE SOURCE TO THE SYMBOL FOR
           ALTERATION PURPOSES.
             THE 'PUNCHX' SUBCOMMAND IS NOW SUPPLIED.  IT PRODUCES
           ASSEMBLER SOURCE USING HEXADECIMAL DECLARATIONS SO THAT
           ONLY ONE CARD IMAGE IS REQUIRED FOR EACH SYMBOL.
           (YOU MUST PRE-ALLOCATE SYSPUNCH TO A SUITABLE DATA SET IN
           ORDER TO GET THE ASSEMBLER SOURCE OF YOUR SYMBOLS.)
             IF YOU ARE WONDERING HOW TO USE YOUR NEW ARTISTIC SYMBOLS
           IN YOUR FULLSCREEN TSO PROGRAM/COMMAND, AS A LAST RESORT
           YOU COULD SEE HOW 'TERMTEST' DOES IT AND COPY THE METHOD.
             SINCE 'TERMTEST' STORES SYMBOL BIT PATTERNS IN A PDS MEMBER
           ON DISK (MEMBER 'PROGSYMA' USING DDNAME=ISPPROF) YOU CAN
           TEST NEW SYMBOLS ON DIFFERENT TERMINALS (AND SYSTEMS)
           BEFORE INCORPORATING THEM INTO YOUR PROGRAM.  SOURCE FOR
           UPDATED SYMBOLS CAN BE READILY OBTAINED.  YOU CAN STORE
           AWAY OLD 'PROGSYMA' MEMBERS IF YOU WANT MORE THAN 190
           DIFFERENT SYMBOLS IN YOUR 'TERMTEST' REPETOIRE.  ONCE
           YOUR PROGRAM HAS VERIFIED A TERMINAL'S "LOAD PROGRAMMABLE
           SYMBOL SET" CAPABILITY WITH A QUERY, IT CAN LOAD (ONCE) AND
           USE (MANY TIMES) MEANINGFUL AND DESCRIPTIVE SYMBOLS WITH
           NEGLIGIBLE OVERHEAD.  FURTHER, ALL THIS CAN BE DONE WITH
           COMPLETE INDEPENDENCE FROM SOFTWARE GRAPHICS PACKAGES AND
           PROPRIETRY SUBROUTINE CALLS.  (YOU DON'T NEED GDDM OR SAS!!)
             ONCE A 3440-BYTE 'PROGSYMA' MEMBER HAS BEEN CREATED,
           'TERMTEST' WILL USE UPDATE-IN-PLACE TO MAKE ALTERATIONS
           IN ORDER TO AVOID THE NEED FOR PDS COMPRESSES.
           (3440 BYTES IS 43 80-BYTE RECORDS.)
