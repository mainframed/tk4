  THIS IS THE NINTH SHIPMENT OF FILE 134 - DATED SEPTEMBER 1992.

  COLOUR FULLSCREEN PROGRAMS NOW HAVE A MINOR CORRECTION SO THAT IF
  A LINE MODE MESSAGE IS SENT TO THE TERMINAL AT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL
  MOMENT, THEN QUERY RESPONSE HANDLING IS STILL PERFORMED CORRECTLY.
  AFFECTED PROGRAMS ARE REVIEW, SNAKE, TERMTEST AND WORM.


$$$BRIEF - UPDATED FOR THIS SHIPMENT.

$FREEALL - (NEW.)  THIS IS AN OLD SECV TSO COMMAND I HACKED IN
           1984 BASED ON THE FREEALL COMMAND IN CBT FILE 300
           FROM JIM MARSHALL.  I HAVE NOW UPDATED IT AND INCLUDED
           IT HERE.  SEE THE CHANGE LOG IN THE LEADING SOURCE
           COMMENTS FOR MY RECENT ALTERATIONS.  IT IS NOT A PATCH
           ON THE ALL-SINGING ALL-DANCING VERSION FROM GTE LABS
           SUPPLIED IN CBT FILE 160 BY CHUCK HOFFMAN (AND ALSO
           IN CBT FILE 300 BY JIM MARSHALL), BUT IT IS A LOT
           SIMPLER AND AS FAR AS I CAN TELL HAS ONE FEATURE
           THE OTHER ONES DON'T HAVE.  THIS VERSION TREATS
           TERMINAL AND NON-TERMINAL FILES DIFFERENTLY.  SO,
           ASSUMING YOU DON'T CHANGE THE SUPPLIED DDNAME TABLES,
           IT WILL FREE FILE 'SYSPRINT' IF IT IS ALLOCATED TO
           A DATA SET, BUT NOT IF IT IS ALLOCATED TO THE TERMINAL.
           DEPENDING UPON THE MODUS OPERANDI AT YOUR SHOP, THIS
           COULD BE ULTRA HANDY, OR A BIG FAT IRRELEVANCY.  STILL,
           IT TAKES ALL SORTS.  (AND I DON'T MEAN CA-SORT, DFSORT,
           SYNCSORT ETC.)

$FREEAL# - (NEW.)  TSO HELP FOR $FREEALL.

$HBLIST  - MINOR CHANGES TO IMPROVE COSMETICS AND ACCURACY.
           NOTE THAT IF OUTDATASET/ODS IS USED TO CREATE A DATA SET
           THEN BLKSIZE=0 IS NOW USED SO SYSTEM DETERMINED BLOCKSIZE
           SUPPORT IS ASSUMED.  SEE THE COMMENTS AT THE START OF THE
           PROGRAM SOURCE.

$HMLIST  - MINOR CHANGES TO IMPROVE COSMETICS, ACCURACY AND INFORMATION.
           NOTE THAT IF OUTDATASET/ODS IS USED TO CREATE A DATA SET
           THEN BLKSIZE=0 IS NOW USED SO SYSTEM DETERMINED BLOCKSIZE
           SUPPORT IS ASSUMED.  ALSO, THE DETAIL LAYOUT HAS CHANGED
           A SMALL BIT.  SEE THE COMMENTS AT THE START OF THE SOURCE.

$HMLIST# - (NEW.)  TSO HELP FOR $HMLIST.

DDASD    - NOW UPDATED TO RUN UNDER MVS/SP4.  CAN BE RUN IN BATCH
           WITH PGM=DDASD.  OPTIONAL PARM TO LIMIT DISPLAY BY
           VOLUME SERIAL PREFIX SEEMS TO REQUIRE TRAILING BLANKS
           TO SIX BYTES IN TOTAL, OR ELSE ALL VOLUMES ARE LISTED.
           UNDER TSO, CAN SAY 'DDASD TSO' TO LIST VOLUMES WITH
           VSNS STARTING WITH 'TSO'.  CAN ALSO SAY 'DDASD (TSO WORK)'
           TO LIST VSNS STARTING WITH 'TSO' AND 'WORK' IN ONE HIT.
           'DDASD' DEFAULTS TO 'DDASD ALL'.  LOAD MODULE IS RE-ENTRANT.

IKJEFF10 - (NEW.)  TSO SUBMIT EXIT STOLEN FROM CBT FILE 369.
           MODIFIED FOR ISPF/PDF 3.2 OFFSETS AND FIXED SO
           'PROFILE NOWTPMSG' DOES NOT CAUSE WACKY BEHAVIOUR.
           ITS FUNCTION IS TO PLACE THE SOURCE DATA SET NAME OF
           THE JCL BEING SUBMITTED IN A JCL COMMENT AFTER THE
           JOB CARD IF 'PROFILE WTPMSG' IS ACTIVE.  X'20' WILL
           HAVE TO BE SUBTRACTED FROM THE ISPF/PDF EDIT OFFSETS
           FOR CORRECT PROCESSING WITH ISPF/PDF VERSION 2.

IKJEFF53 - (NEW.)  TSO STATUS/OUTPUT/CANCEL EXIT.  THIS IS THE
           IPO VERSION WITH A SMALL BUT PHILOSOPHICALLY SOUND
           MODIFICATION.  THE IDEA IS THAT A TSO CANCEL IS
           ALLOWED EVEN IF THE JOBNAME EQUALS THE USERID AND
           HAS NO EXTRA CHARACTERS.  SINCE JES2 PROHIBITS THE
           CANCELLING OF RUNNING STARTED TASKS AND TSO USERS
           (AS PER THE '$C' OPERATOR COMMAND), NO HARM IS DONE.
           HOWEVER, THE TSO USER CAN NOW CANCEL SPOOLED OUTPUT
           FROM PREVIOUS TSO SESSIONS (AS LONG AS THE OUTPUT
           ELEMENT HAS NOT BEEN ASSIGNED TO A PRINT/PUNCH DEVICE).
           ALSO NOTE THAT 'STATUS TSO' PRODUCES A LIST OF
           LOGGED ON TSO USERS.

           IF YOU WANT TO TEST EITHER OF THE TSO FIB EXITS ABOVE
           THEN JUST WHIP THE LOAD MODULE(S) FROM CBT FILE 135
           INTO AN APF AUTHORIZED STEPLIB OF YOUR TSO SESSION
           AND SEE IF THEY WORK AND IF YOU LIKE THEM BEFORE
           YOU INSTALL THEM PROPERLY WITH AN SMP USERMOD OR
           WHATEVER.

LDEFISMF - SAMPLE CLIST TO REDUCE ISMF FILE ALLOCATION AT LOGON TIME.

LDEFIPCS - SAMPLE CLIST TO REDUCE IPCS FILE ALLOCATION AT LOGON TIME.

LDEFSMPE - SAMPLE CLIST TO REDUCE SMPE FILE ALLOCATION AT LOGON TIME.
           SEE OPTION "W" DISCUSSION BELOW.

LDEFSORT - SAMPLE CLIST TO REDUCE SORT FILE ALLOCATION AT LOGON TIME.

REVIEW   - RELEASE 15.  CHECK THE CHANGE LOG IN THE LEADING SOURCE
           COMMENTS.  AS WELL AS MINOR FIXES, THE '=SEQLOAD' COMMAND
           HAS BEEN ADDED, AS HAS NATIVE VSAM SUPPORT FOR VSAM KSDS,
           ESDS AND RRDS CLUSTERS.  (ISSUE A REVIEW SPECIFYING
           A VSAM CLUSTER NAME THAT IS ALSO NOT A COMPONENT NAME.
           APF AUTHORIZATION IS NOT NEEDED FOR THIS.  IF A VTOC
           ENTRY IS FOUND THEN THE NAME IS A COMPONENT NAME AND
           VSAM IS NOT USED FOR FILE I/O.)  THE VSAM CODE ADDED
           IS FULLY RE-ENTRANT AND SYSTEM INDEPENDENT SINCE ALL
           CONTROL BLOCKS ARE GENERATED AT RUN TIME, AND SHOULD
           RUN CORRECTLY ON ANY RELEASE OF MVS OR MSP.
           THE COLOR OF SMF RECORD FORMATS CAN NOW BE SET BY THE USER.
           ALSO, 'FIND' NOW HAS TOP/BOTTOM WRAP-AROUND FOR
           REPEAT OPERATIONS.  (AND THERE WAS MUCH REJOICING!)
              STOP PRESS: LOAD MODULE CESD AND IDR RECORDS HAVE DATA
           BROKEN OUT AND FORMATTED (NOT JUST THE LINK EDIT IDR)
           - SIMPLY SCROLL RIGHT PAST THE END OF THESE RECORDS!
             (TRY IT WITH IGDZILLA OR ARCCTL OR GIMSMP OR IEANUC01....)

           HMMM.  NOT COUNTING THE TSO HELP, THE GENERAL TEXT
           DOCUMENTATION, AND THE SMF RECORD FORMATTING SUBROUTINE,
           "REVIEW" SEEMS TO BE GROWING AT AROUND ONE THOUSAND
           (1,000) LINES OF CODE PER YEAR.

REVIEW#  - (REVIEW TSO HELP.)  UPDATED FOR R15.0 AND IS NOW DUAL CASE.

REVIEW@  - GENERAL DOCO UPDATED FOR RELEASE 15.  ISSUE
           F × 1
           UNDER BROWSE (OR REVIEW) TO LOCATE UPDATES.

REVSMF   - ADDED FORMATTING FOR FUJITSU'S PDLF (SMF TYPE 127).
           HANDLE SP4 VERSION OF TYPES 9 AND 11 (CHANGED FOR ESCON).
           ENHANCE HSM FSR RECORD PROCESSING.
           ENHANCE HSM VSR RECORD PROCESSING FOR NON-PRIMARY VOLUMES.
           ADD HSM DSR RECORD PROCESSING.
           CHANGE TYPE 23 PROCESSING TO USE DATA SECTION TRIPLETS,
           THUS CORRECTING PROCESSING UNDER ESA.
           ADD DB2 SMF RECORD (TYPE 100, 101 AND 102) PROCESSING.
           ADD DIV AND VLF SMF RECORD (TYPE 41) PROCESSING.
           (DB2 AND VLF FORMATS ARE LEFT/RIGHT SCROLL SENSITIVE.)

SNAKE    - INITIALIZATION FIX MENTIONED ABOVE.

TERMTEST - RELEASE 9.4.  MINOR ENHANCEMENTS.

WORM     - INITIALIZATION FIX MENTIONED ABOVE.

ZAP      - FIXED SO 'FULLVOL' WORKS ON ECKD (IE. 3390) DEVICES.

WHICH SMPE?  WHICH GLOBAL ZONE DO YOU WANT TO ACCESS?
             PERHAPS YOU COULD BENEFIT FROM OPTION "W"!!
WHAT IS OPTION "W"?
             IT IS ONE (1) PANEL CALLED SPGSMPEP
             (FORMERLY SHIPPED AS SPGSMPE1)
                       =AND=
             ONE CLIST CALLED SPGSMPE
             (SPGSMPE4 IS SMP/E R4 VERSION AND
              SPGSMPE5 IS SMP/E R5.1 VERSION - IF YOU HAVE OLD SMP/E
      RELEASE THEN USE THESE AS A TEMPLATE FOR YOUR SPGSMPE CLIST).

THE IDEA IS TO SAVE UP TO TEN (10) GLOBAL ZONE DATA SET NAMES.
THESE ARE PRESENTED IN A LIST.  PUT 'S' BESIDE THE APPROPRIATE GLOBAL
ZONE NAME AND YOU DROP INTO SMP/E DIALOGS WITH THE CORRECT GLOBAL ZONE
DATA SET NAME ALREADY LOADED WITHOUT HAVING TO TYPE IN THE WHOLE NAME.

I USUALLY HAVE OPTION "M" AS THE CONVENTIONAL SMP/E OPTION AND
OPTION "W" AS ITSELF.  THEN FOR SMP/E R4 IN ISR@PRIM WE HAD:

                M,'PGM(GIMISCV) PARM(&ZCMD) NEWAPPL(GIM) NOCHECK'
                W,'CMD(%SPGSMPE) NEWAPPL(GIM)'

LATER, FOR SMP/E R5.1 IN ISR@PRIM WE HAD:

                M,'PGM(GIMSTART) PARM(&ZCMD) NEWAPPL(GIM) NOCHECK'
                W,'CMD(%SPGSMPE) NEWAPPL(GIM)'

THEN IBM CHANGED THE APPL NAME, SO FOR SMP/E R6 WE COULD HAVE:

                M,'PGM(GIMSTART) PARM(&ZCMD) NEWAPPL(SMPE) NOCHECK'
                W,'CMD(%SPGSMPE) NEWAPPL(SMPE)'

BUT WE REALLY HAVE:

                M,'CMD(%LDEFSMPE &ZCMD) NOCHECK'
                W,'CMD(%SPGSMPE) NEWAPPL(SMPE)'

AND NOW A COUPLE OF POINTS.

FIRSTLY, NOTE THE USE OF NOCHECK.  IT MEANS THAT (PRE-R6) "M.3.1" OR
(R6 AND LATER) "M.1.3.1" CAN BE USED TO GET STRAIGHT INTO "CSI QUERY".

SECONDLY, NOTE THE LDEFSMPE CLIST (INCLUDED IN THIS FILE).  THIS MEANS
THAT THE SMP/E ISPF FILES ARE NOT ALLOCATED (AND SEARCHED BY ISPF)
UNLESS THE USER IS ACTUALLY IN THE SMP/E DIALOGS.  FURTHER, SINCE THEY
WERE LIBDEF'D THEY WILL BE SEARCHED FIRST ONCE INSIDE THE DIALOG, THUS
SPEEDING RESPONSE.  THE FILES CAN BE COMPRESSED OR MOVED WITHOUT ALL
SYSPROGS HAVING TO LOGOFF, JUST GET OUT OF SMP/E DIALOGS.  THIS METHOD
CAN BE APPLIED TO OTHER ISPF APPLICATIONS SUBJECT TO:
    - PLACE ALL LOAD MODULE LIBRARIES SUCH AS 'SYS1.SGIMLMD0'
      IN THE LINK LIST TO MINIMIZE OVERHEAD AND TSO ALLOCATION.
    - APPLICATIONS THAT RUN NATIVELY FROM TSO READY PROBABLY NEED
      THEIR CLIST LIBRARY IN THE SYSPROC CONCATENATION IN THE LOGON
      PROC JCL.  AN EXAMPLE IS IPCS.

FURTHER EXAMPLES OF THE LIBDEF CLISTS ARE:

                F,'CMD(%LDEFISMF &ZCMD) NOCHECK'
                I,'CMD(%LDEFIPCS)'
                O,'CMD(%LDEFSORT &ZCMD) NOCHECK'

THE LDEF____ CLISTS ARE SUPPLIED IN THIS FILE.

JUST TO REITERATE: THE OBJECTIVE IS TO ALLOCATE ISPF FILES BELONGING TO
A SPECIFIC ISPF APPLICATION ONLY WHILE IN THAT APPLICATION.  AT OTHER
TIMES THAY ARE NOT NEEDED SO THEY CAN BE REMOVED FROM TSO LOGON JCL.
LOGON TIMES AND ISPF SEARCH TIMES ARE THUS REDUCED.  FURTHER, ONCE
INSIDE THE APPLICATION, ISPF SEARCH TIMES ARE STILL REDUCED BECAUSE
THE LIBRARIES THAT ARE ADDED VIA 'LIBDEF' ARE SEARCHED FIRST.
