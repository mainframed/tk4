  THIS IS THE FIFTH SHIPMENT OF FILE 134 - DATED APRIL 1991.
  ALL THOSE PROGRAMS WHICH HAD THE OLD "QUERY-RESPONSE-OVER-TWO-TGETS"
  PROBLEM HAVE BEEN FIXED BY SAYING 'NOEDIT=YES' ON THE 'STFSMODE ON'
  MACRO.  PRETTY %^&*$×@#% OBSCURE IF YOU ASK ME.  I HAD TO SEND A
  QUESTION TO IBM IN THE END, BUT AT LEAST I GOT AN ENLIGHTENING
  RESPONSE AFTER ONLY A COUPLE OF DAYS.  AFFECTED PROGRAMS ARE
  REVIEW, TERMTEST, SNAKE AND WORM.
  ALTERATIONS THIS TIME ARE:


REVIEW   - RELEASE 11.0.  AGAIN, CHECK THE CHANGE LOG, THIS TIME FOR
           THE 1991 ENTRIES.  A FEW ADDITIONS/CORRECTIONS FOR TAPE AND
           VSAM FILES.
REVSMF   - MINOR IMPROVEMENTS, THE MOST IMPORTANT OF WHICH ARE LISTED
           IN THE LEADING COMMENTS.
TERMTEST - RELEASE 9.0.  MINOR IMPROVEMENTS.  THE CGCSGID IS NOW
           SHOWN FOR READ-ONLY CHARACTER SETS, IF AVAILABLE, WITH THE
           'SYMSET' COMMAND.  IT IS MADE UP OF A 2-BYTE CHARACTER SET
           IDENTIFIER FOLLOWED BY A 2-BYTE CODE PAGE IDENTIFIER.
           PROGRAMS USING NON-STANDARD SYMBOLS FROM THE PRIMARY OR
           ALTERNATE (APL) CHARACTER SETS SHOULD VERIFY THIS ID.  FOR
           EXAMPLE, A 3192-C MAY HAVE SQUARE BRACKETS FOR X'41' AND
           X'42', BUT A 3192-G MAY NOT.  MY MEMOREX TERMINAL HAS A
           PRIMARY SYMBOL SET ID OF X'0065-0025' AND AN APL SYMBOL
           SET ID OF X'017E-0136'.  A DATA STREAM OF X'08750876' WILL
           GIVE A LITTLE PICTURE OF A CRT SCREEN, WITH X'08E008EB'
           MAKING A LITTLE KEYBOARD, BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN THESE SYMBOLS
           ON ANY IBM SCREEN (WHICH DOESN'T MEAN MUCH).
           NOTE THAT THE TGET RETURN CODE IS NOW X'18'.
SKJ$LC03 - FIXES SUPPLIED BY ROB VAN RIEL:
           $LISTC - SUPPRESS MASTERCATALOG AS FINAL ITEM OF EVERY
                    LISTING.
           $SPACE - TRUNCATE SUPERFLUOUS HEADING WITH 'NOPRINT' OPERAND.
ZAP      - CHANGED BY BRUCE BORDONARO OF PERSHING AND COMPANY
           TO USE DYNALLOC INSTEAD OF IKJDAIR.  AS A RESULT, THE
           'ALLOCDSN' OPERAND HAS BEEN REMOVED.  ALSO, ZAP IS NO
           LONGER RE-ENTRANT, WHICH PROBABLY DOESN'T MATTER MUCH
           UNLESS YOU SAY IT IS IN YOUR LINK EDIT.
           PREVIOUSLY, A 'BLKSIZE' OPERAND HAD BEEN ADDED TO OVERIDE
           THE DSCB BLOCKSIZE.  ALSO, 'N' IS NOW SUFFICIENT TO DELETE
           THE ZAP LOG WHERE 'NO' HAD BEEN REQUIRED.
ZAP$     - THE JCL TO ASSEMBLE AND LINK ZAP HAS BEEN UPDATED TO
           REFLECT THE ABOVE CHANGES.
ZAP#     - THE TSO HELP MEMBER HAS BEEN UPDATED TO REFLECT THE
           ABOVE CHANGES.
OAC..... - (NEW.)
           MACROS NEEDED TO ASSEMBLE ZAP.  PREVIOUSLY THEY WERE IN
ZAP@     - WHICH HAS NOW BEEN DELETED.
ZAPUPDTE - DELETED BECAUSE OAC MACROS NOW SHIPPED AS DISCRETE MEMBERS.
