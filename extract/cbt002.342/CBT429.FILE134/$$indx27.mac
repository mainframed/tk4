REVIEW   - Don't overlay the Rmode24 program size total with the
  &        literal 'PDSE' for program object libraries.
REVSUBS    Also avoid S0C1 with ZIP files which REVIEW can't handle
           (invalid/incomplete/internal limit exceeded etc.).
           Ensure the NOT sign is x'5F' in the source code.
           (PC file transfers seemed to change x'5F' to something else.)
           REVIEW now at Release 32.2.

LISTICAT - Replaced the included back-level object deck from 1994
           with a 1998 one in-sync with the included source code.
