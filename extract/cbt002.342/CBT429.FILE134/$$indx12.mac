*                                                                      *
* NOTE FROM SAM GOLOB:  GREG SENT ME AN UPDATE TO JIM LANE'S PROGRAM   *
*                       CALLED LISTICAT FROM FILE 047 ON THIS TAPE.    *
*                       HOWEVER, JIM LANE ALSO SENT ME AN UPDATE TO    *
*                       LISTICAT AND THE REST OF HIS FILE.  THEREFORE  *
*                       I HAVE TO INCLUDE GREG PRICE'S LISTICAT HERE   *
*                       IN FILE 134, BECAUSE FILE 047 IS ALL NEW NOW.  *
*                                                                      *
* REVIEW   - RELEASE 18.  CHECK THE CHANGE LOG IN THE LEADING SOURCE   *
*            COMMENTS OF MEMBERS 'REVIEW' AND 'REVSMF' FOR CHANGES.    *
*            'REVIEW' NOW HAS AN ALIAS CALLED 'HEL'.                   *
*          - "FASTPATH" MADE DEVICE INDEPENDENT - USE TRKCALC TO GET   *
*            BLOCKS PER TRACK - NO NEED TO PRE-CODE DEVICE GEOMETRY.   *
*            SO NOW REVIEW FULLY SUPPORTS THE 9345.                    *
*          - A REVVSAM OF A DB2 TABLESPACE DATA COMPONENT CAN NOW      *
*            BREAKOUT ROWS AS LOGICAL RECORDS.  WORKS FOR 4K AND 32K   *
*            PAGE TABLES.                                              *
*            NOTE: ROWS PRESENTED IN PHYSICAL ORDER SO WATCH OUT IF    *
*            THERE IS MORE THAN ONE TABLE PER TABLESPACE.  (THE ROWS   *
*            COULD BE INTERMINGLED.)                                   *
*          - SUPPORT VSAM ACCESS TO ALL VSAM OBJECTS - DEFAULT IF      *
*            NOT APF AUTHORIZED - INCLUDING ROWS FROM 4K DB2 TABLES.   *
*          - FIX TO MEMBER LIST SORT BY TTR.                           *
*          - FIX FOR BAD LRECL WHEN RECFM=F.                           *
*          - ADD 'FINDNOT' AND 'RFIND' STUFF.                          *
*          - FIX HEL SUBCOMMAND PROCESSING.                            *
*            SEARCHING FOR HELP ON SUBCOMMAND 'ABC' COULD HAVE         *
*            RESULTED IN THE DISPLAY OF HELP FOR SUBCOMMAND 'ABCD'.    *
*                                                                      *
*            EXPERIENCED 'REVIEW' USERS SHOULD PROBABLY READ THE       *
*            LATEST 'FUNCTION' SECTION AT THE START OF THE HELP        *
*            MEMBER TO GET FULLY "UP TO SPEED".                        *
*                                                                      *
*            CURRENT 'REVIEW' USERS WHO HAVE A PROFILE MEMBER ARE      *
*            ADVISED TO CHANGE THE VALUE OF THEIR "REPEAT FIND"        *
*            PFK(S) FROM 'FIND' TO 'RFIND' SO THAT 'FINDNOT'S CAN      *
*            ALSO BE EASILY REPEATED.                                  *
*                                                                      *
* REVINST  - A MEMBER CALLED 'REVINST' IS NOW SUPPLIED TO DOCUMENT     *
*            THE DETAILS OF FULLY INSTALLING THE "REVIEW/HEL" PACKAGE. *
*                                                                      *
