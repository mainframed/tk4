$$TSDDOC - DOCUMENTATION FOR THE $SPACE AND $LISTC TSO COMMANDS FROM
           THE SECV.  THIS IS ALSO THE PROGRAM BEHIND THE TSD UTILITY
           SPF OPTION (OPTION "U").  SOURCE MEMBERS ARE SKJ....., SPF
           LIBRARY MEMBERS ARE TSD...... WITH $LISTC AND $SPACE BEING
           THE TSO HELP FOR THOSE COMMANDS.  OPTION "U" WAS DEVELOPED
           BY LEX EREMIN, WITH ROB VAN RIEL INTEGRATING IT INTO THE
           LATEST VERSION OF HIS $SPACE/$LISTC COMMAND WHICH NOW
           SUPPORTS ICF VSAM.
           OPTION "U" (OR EXEC CLIST TSDCUT10 FROM INSIDE SPF) IS A
           SUPERIOR 3.4 DEVELOPED YEARS BEFORE THERE WAS A 3.4.  (I
           TYPED THIS BEFORE I SAW ISPF/PDF 2.3'S 3.4 OPTION.)  IT
           CAN INVOKE LOTS OF UTILITIES, MANY OF WHICH ARE FROM SHARE
           AND/OR CBT TAPES.  SUCH STUFF NOT SUPPLIED HERE INCLUDES
           THE STATS PROGRAM, THE RLSE COMMAND (MAKE SURE YOU GET THE
           ONE THAT HAS VOL OPERAND SUPPORT) AND THE TREMENDOUS PDS
           COMMAND.  OTHER SIMILAR STUFF (REVIEW, SHOWDS, ZAP) IS ALSO
           SUPPLIED HERE WITH VARYING DEGREES OF MODIFICATION.
           SELECTION 'Q' WAS TO INVOKE A THIRD PARTY QUICK COMPRESS
           PROGRAM NOT SUPPLIED HERE.  USAGE OF THIS PACKAGE AS IS
           SHOULD BE RESTRICTED TO SYSTEM TYPES.
$HBLIST  - LIST HSM BACKUP DETAILS FOR DATA SETS BY LEADING CHARACTER
           STRING.  IT EVEN WORKS WHEN HSM IS DOWN, UNLIKE HLIST.
           REQUIRES RACF READ ACCESS TO THE HSM BCDS.  TSO COMMAND
           FROM THE SECV WRITTEN BY LEX EREMIN.
$HBLIST# - TSO HELP FOR $HBLIST.
$HMLIST  - SIMILAR TO $HBLIST EXCEPT FOR HSM MIGRATED DATA SETS.  ALSO
           WORKS WHEN HSM IS DOWN.  REQUIRES RACF READ ACCESS TO THE
           HSM MCDS.  TSO COMMAND FROM THE SECV WRITTEN BY LEX EREMIN.
*** NOTE - THE SECV TSO COMMANDS $HBLIST, $HMLIST, $LISTC AND $SPACE
           HAVE THE OUTDATASET OPERAND WHICH CAN BE HANDY FOR
           MASSAGING COMMAND OUTPUT INTO CLISTS OR OTHER POSTPROCESSING.
$INSTALL - JCL FOR ASSEMBLING $LISTC/$SPACE - SEE $$TSDDOC.
$LISTM   - CLIST FOR INVOKING $LISTX IN AN SPF ENVIRONMENT.
$LISTX   - LEX EREMIN'S FULLSCREEN VERSION OF LISTMEM.  VALID MEMBER
           SELECTION CODES ARE 'D' TO DELETE, 'R' TO RENAME (ANY
           CHARACTER ON THE KEYBOARD OTHER THAN SPACE MAY BE USED
           IN THE NEW MEMBER NAME), 'E' TO EDIT, 'B' TO BROWSE.
           'L' FOR LOCATE, 'N' FOR DIRECTORY REFRESH, AND MEMBER
           COMMANDS ARE VALID FROM PRIMARY INPUT AREA.  PF7/19/8/20
           FOR SCROLLING.  PF3/15 TO EXIT AND TO CANCEL A RENAME BEFORE
           THE NEW NAME IS ENTERED.  'MAX' UP AND DOWN ARE ALSO ALLOWED.
ABEND    - FAMOUS TSO HELP.  LIFTED FROM CBT MODS FILE OF SHARE TAPE
           BUT I'VE ADDED A FEW HUNDRED LINES TO IT.
ANIM1-7  - SAMPLE ANIMATION BY C???? H???????.
           INCLUDED HERE IN THE HOPE THAT IT WILL INSPIRE SOMEONE TO
           PRODUCE A FULL-LENGTH ANIMATION FEATURE FOR 3270 WITH
           VECTOR GRAPHICS.
CUBE     - STATIC VECTOR GRAPHICS SAMPLE BY THE SAME CONTRIBUTOR.
DATABASE - INPUT DECK TO PROGRAM.
DCPU     - PROGRAM TO DISPLAY CPU UTILIZATION AT OS CONSOLE OR TSO
           TERMINAL.  PROGRAM PARAMETER CAN BE USED TO CONTROL DURATION
           OF SAMPLE.  CAN BE HANDY TO INSTALL AS A STARTED TASK ON A
           SYSTEM WITHOUT MUCH THIRD PARTY STUFF SO OPERATOR/SYSPROG
           CAN SEE WHO IS HOGGING THE CPU WHEN TSO RESPONSE DIES.  MAKE
           MAKE SURE YOU GIVE THE STARTED TASK HIGH PRIORITY IN YOUR
           ICS.  I/O CODE PINCHED FROM DJOBS/DTSO/DDASD/DTAPES OR SOME
           SUCH.  THE REST OF IT WAS WRITTEN BY GREG PRICE.
           SUPPORTS MVS/XA AND MVS/ESA.
DCS      - THE DEFINE CONSTANTS FOR SCREEN MACRO USED BY REVIEW AND
           ENHANCED A BIT TO SUPPORT EXTENDED COLOURS AND HIGHLIGHTING.
DDASD    - XA ONLY VERSION OF THE DDASD COMMAND LIFTED FROM SOME SHARE
           TAPE IN 1981.  UPDATED TO WORK ON BOTH RELEASE 1 AND 2 OF
           MVS/XA (2.1.X AND 2.2.0).  WORKS OKAY ON MVS/ESA.
DECDATE  - ASSEMBLER SUBROUTINES OF PROGRAM.
DECIDER  - LEX EREMIN'S CLIST FOR VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE.
DIVER    - TSO TPUT PROGRAM WRITTEN BY STEVE BEER.
           I DIDN'T GET THE SOURCE.  USES EXTENDED COLOUR AND GRAPHICS
           ESCAPE.  I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF ZAPPING X'0A23' AT OFFSET
           X'38' TO X'0A32'.  (I BELIEVE IT WAS STEVE'S FIRST
           ASSEMBLER PROGRAM.)
EDVIO    - CLIST BY TONY "I LIVE IN WELLINGTON (NZ) BUT LEFT MY JACKET
           IN MELBOURNE" WATSON TO SPF EDIT THE TEMPORARY ISPCTL FILE.
           MANY DIALOGS LIKE SMPE GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EDIT/BROWSE/
           SUBMIT THE GENERATED JCL.  SUBMIT (BEING *REAL* TSO) HAS NO
           PROBLEM BUT EDIT/BROWSE DOES NOT SUPPORT VIO.  BROWSE IS
           EASILY REPLACED BY REVIEWING THE DDNAME.  THIS CLIST (TO BE
           INVOKED FROM THE PRIMARY COMMAND AREA OF THE APPROPRIATE
           SPLIT SCREEN) ALLOWS FINAL EDITING BEFORE JOB SUBMISSION.
FLAG     - STATIC VECTOR GRAPHICS SAMPLE BY WHATHISNAME.
IMAGE1-2 - STATIC VECTOR GRAPHICS SAMPLE BY WHATHISNAME PRODUCING
           NON-STANDARD COLOURS.

REVCAT   - SYSCTLG BROWSER ADAPTED FROM REVIEW JUST BECAUSE CVOLS ARE
           ORGANIZED LIKE PDS DIRECTORY BLOCKS.  INCLUDED HERE ON THE
           OFF-CHANCE THAT SOMEONE IN THE WORLD OTHER THAN SECV STILL
           HAS OS CATALOGS.
REVCMPBF - 3270 BUFFER COMPRESSION ROUTINE USED BY REVIEW AND REVCAT.
REVIEW   - LIFTED FROM CBT MODS TAPE VERSION 230 CIRCA 1984 AND HAS
           BEEN A "TERMINAL" CASE OF CREEPING FEATURISM EVER SINCE.
           READ LEADING COMMENTS FOR CHANGES.  A PIECE OF RESISTANCE.
           SHOULD WORK WITHOUT ERROR ON ALL KNOWN MVS LEVELS UP TO ESA.
REVIEW$  - JCL TO ASSEMBLE REVIEW.
REVIEW#  - TSO HELP FOR REVIEW.
REVSMF   - SMF RECORD FORMATTING ROUTINE OF REVIEW.  HANDLES LOTS OF
           SMF RECORDS WITH SOME CODE PINCHED FROM $SMFBRWS.  UPDATED
           TO MVS/SP2.2 LEVEL, BUT NO OBVIOUS GLICHES SO FAR UNDER ESA.
REVTAPE  - SAMPLE CLIST SHOWING USE OF REVIEW TO FIND OUT WHAT IS ON
           A TAPE.  CAN BE HANDY IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IS ON A TAPE
           AND YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO JCL.
SCANX    - LEX EREMIN'S PDS SCANNER.  SEARCH ARGUMENTS CAN BE FROM THE
           SIMPLE TO THE BOOLEAN RIDICULOUS.  CAN ALSO SELECT/EXCLUDE
           CERTAIN MEMBER GROUPS (BASED ON MEMBER NAME PREFIX) TO
           REDUCE THE SEARCH TIME.  MOST CONVENIENTLY INVOKED FROM TSD
           UTILITY PANELS.
SHOWDS   - FAMOUS TSO COMMAND LIFTED FROM CBT MODS FILE OF SHARE TAPE
           IN 1983 AND MODIFIED FOR ICF ETC.  A MUST.  WON'T RECALL
           MIGRATED DATA SETS BY ACCIDENT.  READ LEADING COMMENTS IN
           SOURCE FOR EXACT DETAILS.  SIMILAR VERSIONS PROBABLY
           AVAILABLE FROM ELSEWHERE ON THE CBT TAPE.
           SHOULD WORK WITHOUT ERROR ON ALL KNOWN MVS LEVELS UP TO ESA.

SPGSMPE1 - PANEL FOR SPGSMPE CLIST.
TERMTEST - NON-GDDM TSO TERMINAL CAPABLITY TESTER AND SYMBOL EDITOR.
           CRANK IT UP FOR A TEST RUN.  THE SNAZZIER THE TERMINAL THE
           BETTER (PRETTY WELL).  NEEDS THE DCS MACRO TO ASSEMBLE.
           PROGRAM ORGANIZED LIKE A DOG'S DINNER BUT IT DOES THE JOB;
           A TRIUMPH OF THE MONOLITHIC APPROACH.  A MANTELPIECE.
TERMTYPE - MACRO TO PERFORM TSS TERMTYPE FUNCTION.  ONLY SUPPLIED
           HERE SO THAT VIEW MAY BE ASSEMBLED WITHOUT SOURCE CHANGES.
TSD..... - SEE $$TSDDOC.
TSOPNAME - DINKY LITTLE PROG TO COPY RACF PROGRAMMER NAME INTO JES2
           JCT PROGRAMMER NAME FIELD.  INTENDED FOR TSO LOGON CLIST
           SO TSU GENERATED OUTPUT HAS THE PROGRAMMER NAME IN THE
           SEPARATORS.  JES2 2.2.0/3.1.1 VERSION SUPPLIED HERE.  CAN
           BE CHANGED EASILY TO SUPPORT TOP SECRET RATHER THAN RACF.

           A SENSE ID TO A NOMINATED I/O DEVICE, OR A READ BUFFER TO

           EXTENDED ARCHITECTURE.
WORM     - GREG PRICE'S INTERPRETATION FOR TSO OF A PROGRAM SEEN ON
           A UNIX SYSTEM.  A BREAKTHROUGH IN ER... SOMETHING.

           NETWORK DELAY.  READ COMMENTS IN SOURCE FOR FULL DOCO.
X....... - COMPONENTS OF THE FAMOUS SUPERLST VTOC LISTER.  FULLY
           SUPPORTS THE LATEST VTOC SNAZZIES.  READ COMMENTS IN
           XVTCLIST FOR DETAILS.  FRAGMENTATION INDEX CODE ADDED BY
           ROB VAN RIEL.
XVTOCASM - JCL TO ASSEMBLE SUPERLST.
ZAP      - UCLA TSO ZAP COMMAND FROM THE CBT MODS FILE OF VERSION 22
           OF THE SHARE TAPE CIRCA 1983 WITH SOME EXTRA MODIFICATIONS.
           PERHAPS THE MAIN CHANGE IS FULL VOLUME ZAPPING SUPPORT WHICH,
           OF COURSE, REQUIRES THE APPROPRIATE APF AND RACF AUTHORITIES.
