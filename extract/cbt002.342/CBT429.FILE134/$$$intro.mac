     THIS IS PART OF A TWO-FILE CONTRIBUTION BASED UPON SOFTWARE
  COLLECTED OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS (1981-1989).  THE MAIN REASON
  FOR IT IS TO DISTRIBUTE SEVEN-COLOUR SUPER-DOOPER REVIEW, BUT I
  HAVE INCLUDED OTHER STUFF JUST FOR FUN WITH LITTLE EXTRA EFFORT.

     THIS IS THE FIRST PDS (RECFM=FB,LRECL=80) CONTAINING SOURCE,
  MACROS AND DOCUMENTATION (SUCH AS IT IS).  THE SECOND PDS HAS
  EXECUTABLE LOAD MODULE MEMBERS WITH A MAXIMUM BLOCKSIZE ON DISK
  OF 18K.

     MUCH OF THIS DATA HAS COME FROM "SHARE"/"CBT" TAPES AND HAS
  BEEN MODIFIED TO FIX SHORTCOMINGS AND ADD SUPPORT FOR LATER OS
  FACILITIES.  OTHER PARTS ARE ORIGINAL WORK.  MOST OF THE WORK
  WAS CARRIED OUT AT THE STATE ELECTRICITY COMMISSION OF VICTORIA
  IN MELBOURNE BY ROB VAN RIEL, LEX EREMIN AND GREG PRICE.  ALAS,
  WE HAVE NOW ALL LEFT (IN SURNAME COLLATING SEQUENCE ORDER).

     HOWEVER, CORRESPONDENCE OR TELEPHONIC COMMUNICATION REGARDING
  ANY OR ALL OF THE CONTENTS OF THESE FILES SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO -

  I HOPE THAT YOU WILL FIND SOMETHING IN HERE OF INTEREST AND/OR USE.
