$$$BRIEF - UPDATED FOR THIS SHIPMENT.

$$IEFU83 - IEFU83 PACKAGE FROM THE NASPA VIP TAPE.
           CAN DISPLAY I/O DETAILS (COUNT, AM, ETC.) ON JOB OUTPUT.

ABEND    - A FEW MORE CODES ADDED.

IEFUJV   - THESE SMF EXITS ARE USED FOR JOB ACCOUNTING.
+ IEFUJI   IEFUJV VERIFIES THE FORMAT ON THE JOB CARD, AND SUPPLIES
           A ZERO CODE WHENEVER THE ACCOUNT FIELD IS EMPTY (ASSUMING
           THERE IS ROOM IN THE CARD IMAGE).  HENCE, ZERO CODES ARE
           SUPPLIED ON STARTED TASK JOB CARDS.
           IEFUJI USES ACF2 TO VERIFY THAT THE USER IS ALLOWED TO USE
           THE ACCOUNT CODE UNLESS A ZERO CODE IS SPECIFIED.  IF A ZERO
           CODE IS FOUND IT IS OVERLAID WITH THE USER'S DEFAULT ACCOUNT
           CODE.  (THE PRINCIPLE HOLDS FOR RACF AS WELL.)
     ===>  THIS MEANS THAT STARTED TASKS CAN HAVE JOB ACCOUNTING, AND
           DO NOT HAVE TO BE TREATED ANY DIFFERENTLY FROM BATCH JOBS
           AND TSO USERS IN ACCOUNTING POST PROCESSING.
           STEP ACCOUNTING CAN NOW BE A THING OF THE PAST.  (HOORAY!)

LASTCC   - UPDATED TO INCLUDE UP TO TSO/E VERSION 2 RELEASE 3.

MSG2USER - THE VERSION IN $SP4MODS HAS BEEN FIXED TO AVOID ABEND
           S09A-A118.  IT ALSO HANDLES THE NEW (AS WELL AS THE OLD)
           FORMAT OF IEF863I.  FOR PREFERENCE, USE THIS VERSION,
           EVEN FOR SP3 OR EARLIER SYSTEMS.

    NOTE - THE 5 MSG????? MPF EXIT AND THE 1 IEFU83 SMF EXIT LOAD
           MODULES IN CBT FILE 135 SHOULD BE READY-TO-GO ON ANY MVS.
           IEFU83 USES SMF RECORD DSECTS FOR TYPES 14, 21 AND 64,
           BUT THESE USUALLY DON'T CHANGE MUCH.  ALL WERE ASSEMBLED
           ON A SP4.2.0 SYSTEM AT PUT9106 OR LATER.

ISR@PRIM - UPDATED.  THE COPY SHIPPED IN THIS FILE WAS GETTING A BIT
           OLD SO IT WAS REFRESHED.  IT STILL SHOWS HOW TO CRANK UP
           OPTIONS "U" AND "W".  THE  )INIT  LOGIC SHOWS THE NESTING
           LEVEL OF "XO" NESTING.  THIS BRINGS US TO:

XSPLIT   - TSO CLIST TO NEST ISPF SESSIONS.  THE LEVEL IS SHOWN IN THE
           ISR@PRIM SHIPPED IN THIS FILE.  SO, JUST SAY
             XO 3.4                  (ASSUMING YOU WANT TO DO A 3.4)
           FROM INSIDE EDIT AND YOUR EDIT SESSION IS SUSPENDED UNTIL
             =X
           IS ISSUED.  ("EDIT" AND "3.4" ARE JUST EXAMPLES.  APPLIES
           TO ANY ISPF LOCATION.)

           FIRST YOU NEED AN ENTRY IN ISPCMDS SUCH THAT:

           VERB      T  ACTION
                           DESCRIPTION
           XO        0  SELECT CMD(%XSPLIT PARM(&ZPARM))
                           INVOKE ISPF OPTION DIRECTLY OVER CURRENT OPTI
