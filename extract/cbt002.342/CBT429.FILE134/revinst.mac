  To install 'REVIEW' and 'HEL'/'FSHELP' from CBT file 134:

1)   Install load module:

     Method 1:  Copy REVIEW, REV, REVVSAM, FSHELP, FSH and HEL
                from CBT file 135 into your load library.
                (Omit the copy of alias names that you do
                not want on your system, if any.)
                Also copy support modules REVSMF, REVLMOD,
                PDSLOAD, DELINKI, DWNSPDSR.
     Method 2:  Run the JCL in member REVIEW$, editing job card,
                data set names and alias names as appropriate.
                Run the JCL in member REVSMF$, editing job card,
                and data set names as appropriate.
                Run the JCL in member REVLMOD$, editing job card,
                and data set names as appropriate.
                Install PDSLOAD from CBT file 93 (may 1999 or later).
                Install the DELINK package from CBT file 90.

===> Notes on changing the fullscreen help command name:

     The symbolic variables &HELNAME and &HELNAME2 have been
     provided in the source to simplify this optional task.
     However, program logic may make certain assumptions,
     such as subcommand table sort order, which you may have
     to alter if you use different name(s).

===> End of notes on changing the fullscreen help command name.


     The result either way should be a reusable, reentrant, refreshable
     load module called 'REVIEW' with AC=1, RMODE=24 and AMODE=24.
     It should have aliases: 'REV', 'REVVSAM' and the fullscreen
     help command name(s).

     All members should have the same TTR and entry point
     at offset 0 which should be csect 'REVIEW'.

     If not, then your copy or link did not run correctly.

     Ideal installation location is in the link list.

     As well as the 'REVIEW' program and its aliases, there are
     extra support programs, all of which are fully reentrant:
       REVSMF   - used after 'SMF ON' is issued to format SMF records.
                  Should have a residency mode of 'ANY'.
       REVLMOD  - used when '=PDSLOAD' is issued to reconstruct
                  load modules previously offloaded by '=OFFLOAD'.
       PDSLOAD  - used when '=PDSLOAD' is issued and the PDS being
                  REVIEWed has variable-length or fixed-length records.
                  Source is in member 'PDSLOADW' of CBT file 93.
       DELINKI  - used when '=DELINK' is issued to create object "deck"
                  files from load modules.  Written in PL/I with some
                  Assembler subroutines.  Source is in CBT file 90.
                  Should have a residency mode of 'ANY'.
       DWNSPDSR - BPAM support module for DELINKI.
                  Assembler source is in CBT file 90.

2)   Install TSO help:

     Copy member 'REVIEW#' to member 'REVIEW' in your help file,
     and give it two (2) aliases: 'REV' and 'REVVSAM'.
     The 'PDS' command may be useful for assigning alias names.

     If you do not want to use 'FSHELP' then -
     copy member 'HEL#' to member 'HEL' in your help file.

     If you want to use 'FSHELP' then -
     copy member 'FSHELP#' to member 'FSHELP' in your help file,
     and give it aliases of 'FSH' and 'HEL'.


3)   Register TSO commands for general use.

     Update PCF II or similar package if applicable to give general
     users access to these commands.  This step may not be required
     at many sites.


4)   Register 'REVVSAM' as an APF authorized TSO command in member
     'IKJTSO00' of 'SYS1.PARMLIB'.

     This will let you 'REVIEW' physical VSAM components with BSAM.
     This can be useful when catalog/VVDS/CI-control-flags have been
     corrupted, and for looking at physical blocks of non-linear VSAM.
     'REVVSAM' will also break out DB2 rows from 32k page tablespaces.
     ('REVIEW' and 'REV' will handle 4k page tablespaces okay.)

     Do not APF authorize the "standard" command name(s) (eg. 'REV')
     because then ISPF facilities and TSOEXEC task insulation cannot
     be used.

     If you don't want to use REVIEW to breakout rows from 32k page
     tablespaces, look at subsystem (eg. LIBRARIAN with SUBSYS=LAM)
     data sets or VSAM data with broken VSAM control data, then you
     won't need to APF authorize 'REVVSAM'.

     APF authorization IS required to REVIEW 'SYS1.VVDS.Vvolser' files.

     Note that even when APF authorized 'REVIEW'/'REVVSAM' issues no
     'MODESET' macros, does not run in a privileged key, nor in
     supervisor state, and in no way bypasses RACF/ACF2 security.


5)   Ensure GDDM modules (usually 'GDDM.SADMMOD' for OS/390) are in the
     link list if you are going to REVIEW Paintbrush images on a 3270
     terminal with vector graphics (including PCLK/OS2LINK).

     (REVIEW loads and references Programmed Symbols itself, but
     calls GDDM to exploit vector graphics.  On a 3270 terminal (real
     or emulated) with both character (ie. symbol or raster) and vector
     graphics, REVIEW will generally load symbols to render small
     images, and call GDDM to render larger images.  Only GDDM Base
     functions are used.)

________________________________________________________________________

*)   Customization note:

     You may wish to customize the SMF record subtype table at label
     'FSTYPTBL' in the source code.  This could be useful if you
     REVIEW SMF record files and are interested in using 'FINDSMF' to
     not only find a specific SMF record type, but also a subtype of
     that type.  The table is setup for most known IBM-generated SMF
     records, but you can change any entry to suit the records that
     are generated with subtypes at your site.

     It is expected that this will not be needed at most sites.
