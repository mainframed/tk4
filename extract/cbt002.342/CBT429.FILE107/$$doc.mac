THIS MEMBER WAS ADDED BY CBT AND CONTAINS INFORMATION OF WHAT I
RECEIVED FROM JIM BLALOCK OF CLEMSON UNIVERSITY

THESE TWO FILES CONTAIN THE CLEMSON UNIVERSITY STRUCTURED MACRO LIBRARY
AND A SAMPLIB CONTAINING STRUCTURED MACRO EXAMPLES. THE MACRO LIBRARY
CONTAINS TWO DOC MEMBERS $USERGDE AND $INTRNLS. IF THE USER HAS IBM'S
DCB AND GML PRODUCTS, THESE WILL PRODUCE FULL-BLOWN MANUALS; OTHERWISE,
SOME CREATIVE EDITING IS IN ORDER TO MAKE USABLE DOCUMENTATION.

THE SAMPLIB CONTAINS SAMPLE JCL PROCS, THE SOURCE FOR A 'PREPROCESSOR'
THAT VALIDITY-CHECKS YOUR SOURCE (TO INSURE THAT YOUR IF'S LINE UP WITH
ENDIF'S ETS) BEFORE RUNNING THE ASSEMBLER, AS WELL AS SEVERAL SAMPLE
PROGRAMS THAT DEMONSTRATE THINGS THAT THE MACROS HELP YOU WITH (LIKE
REENTRANCY AND AMODE SWITCHING). THERE'S ALSO A 'COMMENTS' CLIST THAT
WILL CREATE COMMENT 'BOXES' FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF CODE BLOCKS.
