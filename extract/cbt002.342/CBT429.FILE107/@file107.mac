//*           doesn't have access to GML, the samplib contains      *
//*           an FBM IEBGENER-able version:  It isn't pretty        *
//*           but you can read it.                                  *

//*           We're all seasoned professionals here, and busy       *
//*           people besides.  I'll answer questions if I have      *
//*           time, but please take a shot at figuring a            *
//*           problem out on your own first.  The SAMPLIB           *
//*           should contain enough examples to get you past        *
//*           the how-do-I questions.  I'll try to add some         *
//*           more stuff like MPF exits later.                      *
