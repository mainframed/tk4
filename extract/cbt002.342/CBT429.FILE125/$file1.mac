THE INSTALLATION TAPE IS A STANDARD LABELED CARTRIDGE THAT
CONTAINS TWO FILES.

FILE1 IS THE INSTALLTION INSTRUCTIONS AND JCL. (YOU ARE NOW READING
FILE1.) THIS FILE ALSO APPEARS AS MEMBER $FILE1 IN THE PDS DESCRIBED
BELOW.

FILE2 IS A PARTITIONED DATASET THAT CONTAINS VARIOUS SAS PROGRAMS
AND OTHER RELATED JOBS.


TO UNLOAD THIS FILE1 FROM TAPE (OPTIONAL) USE THE FOLLOWING
IEBGENER PROGRAM:

***********************************************************************
**  THE FOLLOWING DIRECTIONS COME FROM THE TAIL-END OF $SASDOC       **
***********************************************************************

ONCE THE SOURCE PDS HAS BEEN UNLOADED FROM FILE 2 THEN RUN THE
FOLLOWING JOBS FROM THE PDS:
 1) ALLOCATE SAS DATASET. USE MEMBER ALLOCSAS. SPACE REQUIREMENTS
    DEPEND ON HOW MUCH DATA YOU INTEND TO STORE IN THIS DATASET.
 2) PULL OFF RMF RECS FOR A CERTAIN TIME PERIOD (MONTH, WEEK, DAY, ETC.)
    AND STORE ON DISK TEMPORARILY.
    COULD USE PROGRAM XY9910.
 3) SORT RMF RECORDS. SEE SORTRMF MEMBER. (NOTE: THIS IS THE
    SAME SORT THAT MUST BE USED IF RMF RECORDS SRE TO USED
    BY THE RMF POST PROCESSOR.)
 4) MODIFY THE OUTPUT AND SYSTEM ID'S IN RMF70, RMF71, AND, RMF72.
 5) RUN RMF70J, RMF71J, AND RMF72J TO RETREIVE, AND SUMMARIZE
    RMF DATA BY RMF INTERVAL AND THEN STORE IT IN A SAS DATASET.
    YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHECK TO SYSPRINT OUTPUT OF THESE JOBS
    AGAINST YOUR RMF REPORTS TO MAKE SURE IT IS CORRECT.
 6) MODIFY THE MEMBER SASCLIST FOR YOUR INSTALLATION. THESE DIRECTIONS
    ASSUME YOU ARE USING THE DISPLAY MANAGER OPTION OF SAS. BUT
    THEY ARE BASICALLY HOLD TRUE FOR THE OTHER OPTION AS WELL (I.E.
    THE VERSION THAT USES A LINE EDITOR.)
---------
 7) TO PRODUCE SAS GRAPHS USING THE RETREIVED INFORMATION:
      ENTER: EX 'A.XY.SASCPU(SASCLIST)'  FROM OPTION 6 IN TSO.

      WHEN SAS PRESENTS ITSELF ON YOUR SCREEN ENTER:
      INCLUDE DD1(SASMEMBER) ON THE COMMAND LINE, WHERE SASMEMBER
      IS THE NAME OF MEMBER IN A.XY.SASCPU THAT PRODUCES A GRAPH.

      FOR EXAMPLE,   INCLUDE DD1(D2CPU)
      WILL PULL IN THE CODE TO PRODUCE A GRAPH OF CPU UTILIZATION.

      NOTE THAT MOST OF THE "PROC PRINT ... " STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN
      COMMENTED OUT. JUST REMOVE THE ASTERISK FROM COLUMN 1 ON THESE
      STATEMENTS WHEN YOU WISH TO VIEW THE PRINT. ONCE THE DATA IS
      VERIFIED AND/OR YOU NO LONGER WISH TO SEE THE PRINT JUST
      REPLACE THE ASTERISK BACK IN COLUMN 1.
