× **THIS PROGRAM IS THE SAME AS RMF71 EXCEPT IT STORES DATA   **    ×
× **BY WEEK RATHER THAN BY MONTH. IT DOES THIS BY SAVEING     **    ×
× **THE DATA WITH A DIFFERENT NAME (CONTAINS THE CHARACTERS   **    ×
× **"WK" IN THE SAS NAME). COMPARE THE DATA STATEMENTS TO SEE **    ×
× **THE DIFFERENCE.                                           **    ×

×   THIS JOB RECREATES THE RMF 71 RECORD WITH INFORMATION           ×
×   ABOUT PAGES PER SECOND. IT THROWS OUT INTERVALS OF 1 MIN OR     ×
