        SMF/RMF RECORDS
              ×
              ×     Retreive RMF records from SMF tape and store onto
              ×     a disk dataset. (Could use program xy9910 for this.)

         RMF RECORDS
              ×
              ×     Read RMF records with SAS programs and store the
              ×     results on a SAS dataset. (Use SAS programs
              ×     RMF70, RMF71, and RMF72 for this.) One member is
              ×     created for each RMF record type. Contained in this
              ×     member are observations. There is one observation
              ×     for each RMF interval. Additionally, the
              ×     data is kept seperate by system. Therefore, a week's
              ×     worth of data for 1 system that had RMF intervals
              ×     of 1/2 hour would then have 3 SAS members
              ×     (1 for RMF record 70 + 1 for RMF record 71 + 1 for
              ×     RMF record 72 = 3). Each member would contain 336
              ×     observations (48 per day * 7 days in a week = 336).
              ×     Unless, of course, RMF was not up all the time, or
              ×     the system was down.
              ×
              ×     A couple of new programs have been added in an
              ×     attempt to keep track of CPU utilization by
              ×     physical machine (also known as "physical processor
              ×     complex" - for example, one 3090-400S). This will
              ×     allow us to keep track of total CPU utilization
              ×     for a machine irregardless of wether it is
              ×     physically or logically partitioned and how many
              ×     logical CPU's it is using.
              ×
              ×     Basically, there is a program CPUT which summerizes
              ×     RMF data and stores it on a SAS dataset under the
              ×     name  'ssCPyymm'. Where ss = some sort of system
              ×     identifier,  yy = last 2 digits of the year, and
              ×     mm = month. Some examples are:
              ×      P0CP8903 for the month of March 1989 for system P0.
              ×      P1CP8903 for the month of March 1989 for system P1.
              ×      S1CP8904 for the month of April 1989 for system S1.
              ×
              ×     Then there is program CPTOT which attempts to
              ×     combine this data to show utilization for the whole
              ×     machine. This program creates SAS member UTM1yymm.
              ×     (E.g. UTM18903 = March 1989 util. for machine #1.)
              ×     Input for CPTOT is only those system CPU
              ×     utilizations that ran on that phycical machine.

 ONCE THE SOURCE PDS HAS BEEN UNLOADED FROM FILE 2 THEN RUN THE
 FOLLOWING JOBS FROM THE PDS:
 1) ALLOCATE SAS DATASET. USE MEMBER ALLOCSAS. SPACE REQUIREMENTS
    DEPEND ON HOW MUCH DATA YOU INTEND TO STORE IN THIS DATASET.
 2) PULL OFF RMF RECS FOR A CERTAIN TIME PERIOD (MONTH, WEEK, DAY, ETC.)
    AND STORE ON DISK TEMPORARILY.
    COULD USE PROGRAM XY9910.
 3) SORT RMF RECORDS. SEE SORTRMF MEMBER. (NOTE: THIS IS THE
    SAME SORT THAT MUST BE USED IF RMF RECORDS SRE TO USED
    BY THE RMF POST PROCESSOR.)
 4) MODIFY THE OUTPUT AND SYSTEM ID'S IN RMF70, RMF71, AND, RMF72.
 5) RUN RMF70J, RMF71J, AND RMF72J TO RETREIVE, AND SUMMARIZE
    RMF DATA BY RMF INTERVAL AND THEN STORE IT IN A SAS DATASET.
    YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHECK TO SYSPRINT OUTPUT OF THESE JOBS
    AGAINST YOUR RMF REPORTS TO MAKE SURE IT IS CORRECT.
 6) MODIFY THE MEMBER SASCLIST FOR YOUR INSTALLATION. THESE DIRECTIONS
    ASSUME YOU ARE USING THE DISPLAY MANAGER OPTION OF SAS. BUT
    THEY ARE BASICALLY HOLD TRUE FOR THE OTHER OPTION AS WELL (I.E.
    THE VERSION THAT USES A LINE EDITOR.)
 --------
 7) TO PRODUCE SAS GRAPHS USING THE RETREIVED INFORMATION:
      ENTER: EX 'A.XY.SASCPU(SASCLIST)'  FROM OPTION 6 IN TSO.

      WHEN SAS PRESENTS ITSELF ON YOUR SCREEN ENTER:
      INCLUDE DD1(SASMEMBER) ON THE COMMAND LINE, WHERE SASMEMBER
      IS THE NAME OF MEMBER IN A.XY.SASCPU THAT PRODUCES A GRAPH.

      FOR EXAMPLE,   INCLUDE DD1(D2CPU)
      WILL PULL IN THE CODE TO PRODUCE A GRAPH OF CPU UTILIZATION.

      NOTE THAT MOST OF THE "PROC PRINT ... " STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN
      COMMENTED OUT. JUST REMOVE THE ASTERISK FROM COLUMN 1 ON THESE
      STATEMENTS WHEN YOU WISH TO VIEW THE PRINT. ONCE THE DATA IS
      VERIFIED AND/OR YOU NO LONGER WISH TO SEE THE PRINT JUST
      REPLACE THE ASTERISK BACK IN COLUMN 1.
