*    THIS SAS JOB TAKES THE FILE CREATED BY RMF71 AND
*       GRAPHS PAGING RATES.
*       THIS IS A 3D GRAPH BY HOUR BY DAY. THE NUMBER OF DAYS
*       DEPENDS ON THE INPUT.

*       THIS WAS A SCATTER DIAGRAM BUT WAS CHANGED BY MISTAKE
*  --------------------------------------------------------------
*    THIS SAS JOB TAKES THE FILE CREATED FROM RMF RECORD 71'S
*       PRODUCES A GRAPH
*
*     TO READ IN MORE THAN ONE MONTH'S WORTH OF DATA
*     CONCATENATE THE DATA AS FOLLOWS:
*          SET SASDB.P0718810
*              SASDB.P0718811
*              SASDB.P0718812
*
*     AND THEN USE MULTIPLE %INCLUDES TO EXCLUDE CERTAIN
*     DATES. FOR EXAMPLE,
*           %INCLUDE DD1(EX8810)
*           %INCLUDE DD1(EX8811)
*           %INCLUDE DD1(EX8812)
*
*     YOU COULD, OF COURSE, COPY THE EXCLUDE INSTRUCTIONS
*     INTO THE SAS PROGRAM BY ISSUING THE
*     INCLUDE COMMAND ON THE COMMAND LINE AND THEN MOVING
*     THOSE LINES OF CODE TO THE APPROPRIATE LOCATION.
