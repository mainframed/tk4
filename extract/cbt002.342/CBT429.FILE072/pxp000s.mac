÷TUTORIAL ------------ PANEXEC LIBRARY UTILITY - BROWSE ELEMENT---------
÷OPTION  ===>_ZCMD
+
+  The÷browse element+function is used to browse an element of a PANEXEC
   library. (Use the÷element list+option if you wish to browse several
   elements.)  Executable elements (type=EXEC) are browsed in hexadecima
   format (see description of the %PRINT,D command in the PANEXEC system
   reference manual) and CNTL elements (PANEXEC procedures) are browsed
   in character format. Ensure that the DISPLAY CC command is in effect.

   To browse a single element, fill in the following fields of the libra
   utility panel:
       - Enter÷B+in the option field.
       - Enter the÷library+information in the appropriate fields.
       - Enter the element name in the÷element+field

   When you press the ENTER key, the element will be displayed via the
   ISPF browse function.  All browse commands may be used.  Please refer
   to the appropiate IBM ISPF manuals for more information on browse.

   Note that PANEXEC/ISPF places the element that is to be browsed into
   a sequential data set (whose DSN will appear at the top of the panel)
   from which the element may be browsed. This data set is deleted after
   the browse session is completed.
