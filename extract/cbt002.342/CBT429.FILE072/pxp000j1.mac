%TUTORIAL -------------- PANEXEC LIBRARY MAINTENANCE ------------------
%OPTION  ===>_ZCMD
+
   The library maintenance option (L) performs essential library
   maintenance on PANEXEC libraries. This option is available only to
   authorized users (Tech Services and Console Operations).
   The L option generates JCL for the all the maintenace functions
   based on information you enter on the library maintenance
   panel, and then submits the job for batch execution (except for the
   M option, which is executed on-line). A JCL JOB statement at the
   bottom of the panel must be coded.

   The PANEXEC library (and elements) on which maintenance is being
   performed must be specified in the main PANEXEC library utility panel

 The following topics are presented only if selected by number:

        1 - Backup a PANEXEC library (with directory reports)
        2 - Create a PANEXEC library
        3 - Delete inactive elements of a PANEXEC library
        4 - Modify attributes of a PANEXEC library
        5 - Restore a PANEXEC library
        6 - Convert a PDS into a PANEXEC library
