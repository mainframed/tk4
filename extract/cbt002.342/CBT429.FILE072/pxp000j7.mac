%OPTION  ===>_ZCMD
+
     This procedure will convert an entire PDS library into a
new or pre-existing PANEXEC library. PANEXEC uses the member names
of the members on the PDS as the element names for the newly created
elements on the PANEXEC library. The group name, type, status and mode
qualifiers for the newly created elements must be specified on the
primary PANEXEC library utility panel.

The PDS name field must specify the DSN of the PDS to be converted.
If the PDS is not cataloged, the VOLSER of the volume it resides on
must also be supplied.

 The following topics are presented only if selected by number:
