%TUTORIAL ------PANEXEC LIBRARY UTILITY - CHANGE ELEMENT DIRECTORY-----
%OPTION  ===>_ZCMD
+
+  The%change element+function is used to change the directory entry of
   an element.  (Use the%element list+option if you wish to change
   several elements).

   To change a single element, fill in the following fields of the libra
   utility panel:
       - Enter%CH+in the option field.
       - Enter the%library+information in the appropriate fields.
       - Enter the element name in the%element+field

   NOTE - A user may change multiple directory fields for an
          element with one execution of the CH option. If any one of
          these changes fails, then the message ELEMENT NOT CHANGED
          will be produced. However, all fields that were correctly
          changed will be modified.
          CHANGE character fields may contain any characters except
          commas. Blanks will be compressed out of the CHANGE field
          unless the field is enclosed in quotes.
