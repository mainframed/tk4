%TUTORIAL ----------PANEXEC LIBRARY UTILITY - EDIT ELEMENT ---- -------
%OPTION  ===>_ZCMD
+
  %The PANEXEC edit function allows you to create or change PANEXEC
   procedures (elements whose type=CNTL).  (Use the%element list+option
   if you wish to edit several elements.)

   To edit a single element, fill in the following fields of the library
   utility panel:
       - Enter%E+in the option field.
       - Enter the%library+information in the appropriate fields.
       - Enter the element name in the%element+field.

   When you press the ENTER key, the element will be displayed via the I
   edit function. If the element is being created then one blank line wi
   displayed when ENTER is pressed.  All edit commands may be used.  Ple
   refer to the appropiate IBM ISPF manuals for more information on edit
   NOTE that PANEXEC/ISPF does NOT provide an edit recovery environment.

   Note that PANEXEC/ISPF places the CNTL element that is to be edited
   into a sequential data set (whose DSN will appear at the top of the
   panel) from which the element may be edited. This data set is deleted
   after the element is saved back into the PANEXEC library or the edit
   session is cancelled.
