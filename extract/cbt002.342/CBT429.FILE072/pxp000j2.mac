%TUTORIAL -------------- PANEXEC LIBRARY MAINTENANCE - BACKUP ---------
%OPTION  ===>_ZCMD
+
     This procedure will backup the entire PANEXEC library to a
generation data set on tape.  The GDG index is 'HRA.PANXBKUP.libname'.
The retention period field must specify the number of days the PANEXEC
backup tape is to be retained (default = 7).
     This same job will also produce six (6) reports:

    - PE101 PANEXEC file characteristics
      1 page summary of the PANEXEC library
    - PE117 PANEXEC group summary
      1 page summary of the group names and numbers of types and
      statuses of the elements within groups
    - PE106 PANEXEC element summary
      A comprehensive list of every element on the PANEXEC library
      giving access, change, link and backup date information
    - PE108 PANEXEC executable/source cross reference
      A comprehensive list of every executable element on the PANEXEC
      library, similar to the directory listing of PDS load libraries
      (gives load module sizes and link-edit attributes).
