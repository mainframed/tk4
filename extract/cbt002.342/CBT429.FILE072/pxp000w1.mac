%TUTORIAL ---------------- PANEXEC LIBRARY SECURITY --------------------
%COMMAND ===>_ZCMD
+
     TOP SECRET security is in place for the PANEXEC facility and
PANEXEC libraries on several levels through a PANEXEC security exit
interface program. This security is provided above and beyond the native
PANEXEC security which is based on a multi-level password system. The
use of native PANEXEC security will not be allowed to unauthorized users
of batch PANEXEC and PANEXEC/ISPF provides no means of entering PANEXEC
passwords.

     On the first level, TOP SECRET places restrictions on executing
PANEXEC functions. The following require TOP SECRET authorization
before they can be executed:

    L  -   library maintenance
    PM -   promoting PANEXEC elements to production status

     To acquire authorization to execute these options, update access is
required to the PANEXEC system residence library, 'HRA.PANESRL'.  Only
authorized personnel (tech services and console operations) may invoke
the restricted L option PANEXEC/ISPF panel.
