%TUTORIAL ----- PANEXEC LIBRARY UTILITY-CHANGE ELEMENT DIRECTORY -------
%COMMAND ===>_ZCMD
+
+  PANEXEC automatically generates statistics for each element of a
   PANEXEC library. Other statistics are maintained by PANEXEC but must
   be manually entered by the user. These statistics are basically for
   documentation purposes.  You might want to change these statistics
   for reasons such as the following:

       - A person has left the project, and you wish to reassign some of
         the work.  You might then want to change the%owner+of some
         elements to that of the person assuming responsibility.

       - You have elements that were created or modified from
         non-PANVALET source programs.  You would like to track source
         module information.  The change utility may be used to create
         source module statistics for executable elements.
