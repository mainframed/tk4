        The PANEXEC/ISPF dialog uses panels to allow you to select
   options and to specify parameters and commands to simplify requests
   for PANEXEC functions, and provide ISPF services for information disp
   browsing, editing, etc. (including complete TUTORIAL and HELP
   facilities).  It is assumed that the user is already familiar with th
   operation of the batch PANEXEC system as described in the PANEXEC SYS
   REFERENCE MANUAL.  A knowledge of the following is also essential to
   completely understand this dialog:
     ISPF/PDF
     JCL
     LINKAGE EDITOR
     COMPILERS/ASSEMBLER
     TSO/E COMMAND PROCEDURES (CLISTS)
     PANVALET BATCH AND SUBSYSTEM (optional)
     TOP SECRET SECURITY (optional)

        The PANEXEC/ISPF dialog was wholly developed by MORRIS KARLIN
   of HRA/MIS, BUREAU OF TECHNICAL SERVICES and is not a product of
   COMPUTER ASSOCIATES.
