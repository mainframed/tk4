%TUTORIAL ------------PANEXEC -ELEMENT SELECTION LIST ------------------
%OPTION  ===>_ZCMD
+
   The S option displays an element selection list of all or a portion o
   the elements in a PANEXEC library.  You may scroll through the list v
   the%UP+%DOWN+%RIGHT+and%LEFT+scroll commands or via the%LOCATE+comman
   and you may browse one element at a time via the%S+primary command or
   select elements for processing via line commands (browse, edit, print
   copy, etc.). The element selection list itself may be sorted via the
   SORT command or may be written to the ISPF LIST data set via the SAVE
   command or may be cleared of all line commands via the RESET command.

   To display an element selection list:
       - Enter%S+in the option field on the library utility panel.
       - Enter the%library+information in the appropriate fields. The
         DATASET NAME field is required; TYPE, STATUS and MODE are optio
       - Specify blank or generic element name or complete element name.
   The message 'BUILDING DIRECTORY' will display below the command line
   while the dialog constructs the element selection list.

   To automatically clear the GROUP, ELEMENT, TYPE, STATUS and MODE fiel
   enter the "X" option. The "S" option then automatically replaces "X".
   NOTE: See PERFORMANCE Issues on choosing an appropriate DISPLAY VIEW.
