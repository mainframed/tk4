%TUTORIAL -- PANEXEC - ELEMENT SELECTION LISTS - LOCATE COMMAND --------
%COMMAND ===>_ZCMD
+
+  The locate command (which must be entered as %L+) scrolls to the
   entry you specify or the one preceding it on the display if the entry
   is not found. Syntax is as follows:

        %L string+

   where%"string"+can be up to 25 characters long.  It is compared with
   values of the fully qualified element names and must correspond
   syntactically to PANEXEC naming conventions, i.e., the proper delimit
   must separate the group name ('.'), element name ('/'), type name (',
   a semi-colon (';'), the default command stacking delimiter, may%NOT+b
   used) and status and mode.  You must specify all delimiters up to the
   last qualifier you require (even if intermediate qualifiers are not
   specified). If the last qualifier(s) are missing, then you may omit t
   associated delimiters.  If%"string"+is found, that entry is scrolled
   the top of the display.  If it is not found, the entry preceding it i
   scrolled to the top of the display.

   The L command may be used with element name only and no other field
   of the element selection list.
