%TUTORIAL ------- PANEXEC- ELEMENT SELECTION LISTS - SCROLLING --------
%COMMAND ===>_ZCMD
+
+  The command syntax for scrolling to the RIGHT or LEFT is:
           %COMMAND ===> right {n}  or    %COMMAND ===> left {n}

   Scrolling to the right/left displays additional statistical fields
   for each element. The right/left direction in which you may scroll is
   indicated by the (MORE<=m=>) field in the upper right corner of the
   panel with the 1 or 2-directional arrow indicating the permissible
   scroll direction(s) and the imbedded m indicating the logical
   horizontal panel number. Currently, there are 6 horizontal panels.

   An integer value may be specified for n in the scroll command.
   Coding n in the scroll command allows n panels to be scrolled
   horizontally with one command.  If n is not specified or is specified
   as 1 then the screen scrolled one panel to the right/left.  The word
   MAX (or its abbreviation, M) may also be coded for n in which case
   the rightmost/leftmost panel is scrolled to.  If a scroll amount is
   specified that would cause scrolling beyond the rightmost/leftmost
   panel then scrolling is performed as if M had been specified.
