%TUTORIAL -------- PANEXEC LIBRARY UTILITY - ZAP ELEMENT ---------------
%COMMAND ===>_ZCMD
+
+  The%zap element+function is used to zap an element of a PANEXEC
   library. It may also be used to display an executable element (load
   module) map, cross-reference and statistics with or without zapping
   the element.  (Use the%element list+option if you wish to zap several
   elements.)

   The zap function should be used with extreme caution, since any
   changes made to the executable element do not have any corresponding
   source module change documentation.

   To zap a single element, fill in the following fields of the library
   utility panel:
       - Enter%Z+in the option field.
       - Enter the%library information in the appropriate fields.
       - Enter the element name in the%element+field.
