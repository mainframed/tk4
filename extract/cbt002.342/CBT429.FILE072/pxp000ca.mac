%TUTORIAL ---- PANEXEC - ELEMENT SELECTION LISTS - 'SAVE' COMMAND ------
%COMMAND ===>_ZCMD
+
+  The%SAVE+command writes the element list to the ISPF LIST data set.

+  The command syntax is:   %COMMAND ===> save {n}

   An integer value of 1, 2 or 3 may be specified for n in the SAVE comm
   If n is not specified or is specified as 2 (or is not a valid value)
   a 2-line directory listing for each directory element is sent to the
   LIST data set. If n is specified as 1, then a truncated 1-line listin
   sent to the LIST data set. If n is specified as 3 then a full 3-line
   directory listing is sent to the ISPF LIST data set.

   The element list is sent in its current sort order. Unprocessed line
   commands are omitted.  The element list is formatted the way it
   appears on the screen (the PANVALET DATA SET NAME and DESCRIPTION
   fields are truncated) with abbreviated heading line(s).

   The ISPF LIST data set should be defined with a minimum LRECL of 128
   ISPF option 0.5 (LIST data set characteristics) to avoid truncation o
   significant data.

   The current ISPF LIST data set is &zlstname.
