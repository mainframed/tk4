%TUTORIAL ------PANEXEC LIBRARY UTILITY - INPUT PANEXEC PROCEDURE------
%OPTION  ===>_ZCMD
+
+  The%IN+function is used to input a PANEXEC procedure for execution.

+  To input a PANEXEC procedure, fill in the following fields on the
   library utility panel and press the%ENTER+key:

     - Enter%IN+in the option field.
     - Enter the PANEXEC library information that the PANEXEC input
       procedure will use as input.

   The actual name of the PANEXEC input procedure is specified on the
   second panel which will appear after ENTER is pressed.
   NOTE that if any additional input or output files are required by
   the PANEXEC input procedure (besides the PANEXEC library specified
   above), these files must be allocated using TSO ALLOCATE commands
   prior to executing the IN option (for an exception to this, see the
   commments on the REPORTS procedure in the second panel tutorial).

 The following topics will be presented only if selected by number:
