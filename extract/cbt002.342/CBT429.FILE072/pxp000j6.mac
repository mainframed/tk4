%TUTORIAL -------------- PANEXEC LIBRARY MAINTENANCE - RESTORE---------
%OPTION  ===>_ZCMD
+    The library restoration (selected members or all) procedure should
be run on an as needed basis to restore elements from a backup tape to a
PANEXEC library.

     The element name qualifiers must be specified on the primary
PANEXEC utility panel to indicate the element(s) to be restored to the
PANEXEC library.  A single element may be specified or groups of
elements may be specified by omitting the element name and coding any
combination of group, type, status and/or mode qualifiers.  * may be
coded as the element name (with group, type, status and mode blank)
which causes every element on the backup file to restored.

The following fields must be specified on the library maintenance panel:
 REPLACE LIKE-NAMED ELEMENTS- Indicates whether restored elements are to
 like named elements currently residing on the PANEXEC library.  Default
 GENERATION DATA GROUP NUMBER- The relative or absolute generation
 number of the backup tape from which the elements to be restored reside
 on. If both relative and absolute numbers are specified, the relative
 number is used. The absolute number must specify 4 digits.

The following topics are presented only if selected by number:
