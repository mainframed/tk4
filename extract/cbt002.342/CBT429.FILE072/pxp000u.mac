%TUTORIAL -------- PANEXEC MESSAGE LOGGING ----------------------------
%COMMAND ===>_ZCMD
+
+  The PANEXEC/ISPF dialog has the ability to log messages to the user's
   ISPF LOG data set.  To turn this facility on or off simply specify Y
   or N in the LOG field of the primary PANEXEC utility panel. This
   field may even be changed in the middle of a PANEXEC/ISPF session.
   The LOG data set may be viewed in ISPF/PDF option 7.5.

   Only messages indicating the successful completion of a function,
   together with the element on which the function operated, are
   recorded in the LOG data set. In addition, the successful completion
   messages of the SAVE and SORT commands are unconditionally logged.

   The current LOG data set is &zlogname.
