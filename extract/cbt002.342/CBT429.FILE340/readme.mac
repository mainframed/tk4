7980-3 and compatible controllers keep a great deal of statistics. Getti
out is another story. If you have extra $$$, you can use AZTEC; if you a
masochist, you use IDCAMS. In order to learn how the 7980-3 works, I wro
DCM. Here is a sample screen:

This screen snapshot is from a running system. The statistics are for on
device although DCM can provide statistics for a string of devices or fo
devices attached to a controller.

There are two sources of statistics for DCM: the control unit and the ch
subsystem. The pending, disconnect and connect times are provided by the
channel subsystem and are the same as reported by RMF. These times are i
milliseconds. The other times are calculated using the counts maintained
the 7980-3. The interval is between the two times in the upper right han
corner. In general, the very first rate on each line is the sum of the r
rates on the line. The I/O rate is the sum of the normal rate, the seque
rate, the bypass rate and the inhibit rate.

The hit% are calculated from the counters maintained in the 7980-3. The
percentages on the very left of each line are the weighted averages of t
remaining percentages on that line. It is possible to see the long term
the hits since the controller was IML'd or a short term view since the l
that the ENTER key was pressed.

The Stages, Destages and Prereads fields are the number of these operati
per second. The only statistics not maintained in the 7980-3 are the R/W
and the Hits/Stages. R/W is calculated in a straight forward fashion and
Hits/Stages gives some measure of the caching efficiency.

Here is a list of DCM commands:

     AUTO      Repeat display 20 times with a 4 second interval
     ALL       Summarize all devices on the control unit
     <enter>   Refresh the screen with a new set of statistics
     ONL       Run through all online devices on this control unit
     Rnn       Repeat the display nn times with a 4 second interval
     Wnn       Set wait value to nn seconds
     n         Go to next device
     p         Go to previous device
     LR        Long term I/O rates
     SR        Short term I/O rates
     LH        Provide long term hit% (from the time that advanced
               functions were enabled)
     SH        Provide short term delta hit%
     NOUP      Do not re-write history file
     END       Ends DCM session. Q is an abbreviation.
     QN        End DCM without updating the history file.

A unit address or a volume name can be entered to provide statistics for
device. A range of 16 devices can be summarized by providing a generic
address. In the sample screen, to get statistics for devices E10 to E1F,
could be entered on the prompt.
Installing DCM is very easy. Two files are provided in IEBUPDTE input fo
Simply allocate a macro and a source PDS and run an IEBUPDTE job to buil
the PDS's. If you have forgotten IEBUPDTE, here is a some JCL that can b
used:

     //UPDTE   EXEC PGM=IEBUPDTE,PARM='NEW'
     //SYSIN   DD DISP=SHR,DSN=<uploaded sequential file>
     //SYSUT2  DD DISP=SHR,DSN=<pds macros or source>
     //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*

The members $ASM and $LINK in the source are used to build DCM. Note
that DCM is not authorized nor does it need to be.

In order to run DCM, create a 1 track dataset on any device attached to
control unit that you want to monitor. This 1 track file is also used to
e
some information after DCM ends. Simply allocate this dataset to the ddn
MONITOR and call DCM from TSO. If a file is allocated to the ddname
CAPTURE, screen images are saved to that file and can be subsequently
printed by REPLAYP.

DCM was developed on a MVS/ESA 3.1.3 system and has run on MVS/XA 2.2
and MVS/ESA 4.3 systems.

This is the first version of DCM and as time permits, I will add more fe

Version 0.2 fixes an error in the way that UCBs are scanned and cleans u
error handling. It provides support for statistics by volume name.

Version 0.3 includes the status display of the enable/disable switches a
provides the serial number of the control unit. If all switches are not
d
on a 7980-3, you need to install ucode 21-A0 or 21-A8.

Version 0.4 adds support for 3990-3 non-synchronous controllers and
hopefully ESCON controllers.

Version 0.5 adds support for screen captures and different update interv
This is useful in benchmark situations.

Version 0.6 provides support for dynamic UCB's. It probably will not wor
MVS/XA. Bernd Bauer pointed out an error in DCMMAIN in which all counts
were zero.

Version 0.7 contains bug fixes for ESCON controller support which were
pointed out by Bernd Bauer.
