 EACH SPF DIALOG MANAGER CONTAINS A BASIC SET OF CODE THAT IS COMMON
 TO ALL DIALOG MANAGERS. THESE FUNCTIONS HAVE BEEN CREATED IN A SERIES
 OF MACROS TO MAKE WRITING DIALOG MANAGERS EASIER. THE FUNCTIONS ARE -

 SPFALLOC   DYNAMIC ALLOCATION.
 SPFBRWSE   INVOKE BROWSE FOR A DATA SET.
 SPFCMDS    DEFINE VARIOUS CONSTANTS AND WORK AREAS USED BY THE SPF
            INTERFACE ROUTINE.
 SPFCRP     RETREIVES THE CURRENT ROW POINTER
 SPFDEQ     DEQ SPF RESOURCES
 SPFDS      TAKE A DSN FROM THE SCREEN AND EITHER REMOVE THE QUOTES
            OR ADD THE USER-PREFIX AND ISOLATE AN OPTIONAL MEMBER
            NAME. OPTIONALLY IT WILL VERIFY THE EXISTENCE OF THE
            DATA SET BY OBTAINING THE FORMAT 1 DSCB, AND FOR A PDS
            WITH A MEMBER SPECIFIED, A BLDL WILL BE PERFORMED.
 SPFEDIT    INVOKE EDIT FOR A DATA SET.
 SPFENQ     ENQ SPF RESOURCES
 SPFEXIT    STANDARD RETURN LINKAGE.
 SPFINIT    STD LINKAGE, VDEFINE AND VGET FOR ALL 'Z' VARIABLES.
 SPFJOBNM   UPDATE THE LAST CHARACTER OF THE JOBNAME ON A JOBCARD.
 SPFLOC     CAMLST LOCATE.
 SPFOBT     CAMLST OBTAIN.
 SPFRJUST   RIGHT JUSTIFY A FIELD.
 SPFROW     RETREIVE THE ZTDTOP VARIABLE
 SPFSARG    INVOKE TBSARG FOR DATA ON THE ZCMD LINE
 SPFSPLAY   DISPLAY A PANEL.
 SPFSUB     SUBMIT A BATCH JOB.
 SPFTAILR   FILE TAILOR WITH OPTIONAL SUBMIT AND JOBNAME UPDATE.
 SPFTBCR    TABLE CREATE.
 SPFTBDIS   TABLE DISPLAY.
 SPFTBL#    GENERATE AN 8 CHAR TABLE NAME.
 SPFTBLOC   LOCATE A KEY FIELD BASED ON ZCMD DATA.
 SPFTBLRS   RESET THE CURRENT ROW POINTER.
 SPFTCNT1   DISPLAY 'TABLE CREATE IN PROCESS'
 SPFTCNT2   DISPLAY 'TABLE CREATE IN PROCESS'
 SPFTEMP    BUILD A DATA SET NAME FROM ZTEMPF CHANGING THE LAST QUAL.
 SPFVCOPY   COPY VARIABLES.
 SPFVDEF    DEFINE VARIABLES TO SPF.
 SPFVDEL    DEELETE VARIABLES.
 SPFVGET    GET VARIABLES FROM THE SHARED OR PROFILE POOL.
 SPFVPUT    PUT VARIABLES TO THE SHARED OR PROFILE POOL.
 SPFVREPL   REPLACE VARIABLES.

 NOTE: SOME OF THE SPF MACROS USE REGISTERS R2 THROUGH R5, THESE
       REGISTERS ARE SAVED AND RESTORED BY THE MACROS, HOWEVER, THIS
       MEANS THEY CANNOT BE BASE REGISTERS. I SUGGEST THAT YOU START
       WITH R12 AS YOUR BASE REGISTER, AND THEN USE R11, R10, ETC. IF
       YOU NEED SEVERAL BASE REGS.

       SOME OF THE SPF MACROS ALSO USE THE TRT INSTRUCTION, WHICH
       CORRUPTS R2. THIS REGISTER IS NOT ALWAYS SAVED AND RESTORED,
       THEREFORE YOU SHOULD NOT DEPEND ON ITS CONTENTS UNLESS YOU SAVE
       AND RESTORE IT YOURSELF.

              OMITTED PARAMETER OF 'NEW', DISP='(,DELETE)', YOU
              MUST SPECIFY DISP='(NEW,DELETE)'

              WHEN DISP IS CODED ON THE SPFALLOC U (UNALLOCATE) IT
              INDICATES THE OVERRIDE DISPOSITION OF THE DATA SET AT
              UNALLOCATION TIME. IT FOLLOWS THE SAME RULES AS ABOVE
              EXCEPT THAT THE FIELD MAY NOT BE CODED IN PARENTHESES

              THE DATA SETS (DDNAMES) MUST BE ALLOCATED BEFORE THEY CAN
              BE CONCATENATED.


 LITERALS AND FIELDS MAY BE MIXED IN THE 'SPFALLOC' MACRO.

 ANY CHARACTER DATA FIELD HAVING A VALUE OF BLANK, X'40', OR LESS WILL
 BE IGNORED. ANY HEX FIELD HAVING A VALUE OF X'00' WILL BE IGNORED.

 IMPORTANT: THIS MACRO USES REGISTERS R0 THROUGH R5, AND R14,R15.  R2
            THROUGH R5 ARE SAVED AND RESTORED, BUT THIS IMPLIES THAT R2
            THROUGH R5 CANNOT BE YOUR BASE REGISTERS.

 THE RETURN CODES FROM DYNAMIC ALLOCATION WILL BE PLACED IN THE
 FOLLOWING FIELDS:

 SPFDYN15  -  R15 VALUE - 4 BYTES - CHARACTER FORMAT
 SPFDYNER  -  S99ERROR  - 4 BYTES - CHARACTER FORMAT
 SPFDYNIN  -  S99INFO   - 4 BYTES - CHARACTER FORMAT

 THESE FIELDS ARE DEFINED BY THE 'SPFCMDS' MACRO.

1



 THIS MACRO WILL USE THE 2 MESSAGE VARIABLES, &LMSG AND &SMSG. AN
 APPROPRIATE MESSAGE WILL BE PLACED IN THESE VARIABLES IN THE EVENT OF
 AN ERROR. MESSAGE 'CMN000' DISPLAYS &LMSG AND &SMSG.

 OTHER ALLOCATION FUNCTIONS ARE BEING CONSIDERED FOR FUTURE
 ENHANCEMENTS. IF YOU HAVE AN IMMEDIATE NEED FOR 1 OF THESE FUNCTIONS,
 PLEASE LET ME KNOW AND I WILL PROVIDE THE CODE. (BOB BECKER)

   SYNTAX -

   (LABEL)  SPFDS  PROJECT,GROUP,TYPE,MEMBER,OTHERDSN,TARGETDSN,
                   TARGETMBR,NOVERIFY

   PROJECT  - POSITIONAL, IN STANDARD SPF PANELS THIS IS THE 'PROJECT'
              FIELD NAME.

   GROUP    - POSITIONAL, IN STANDARD SPF PANELS THIS IS THE 'GROUP'
              FIELD NAME.

   TYPE     - POSITIONAL, IN STANDARD SPF PANELS THIS IS THE 'TYPE'
              FIELD NAME.

   MEMBER   - POSITIONAL, IN STANDARD SPF PANELS THIS IS THE 'MEMBER'
              FIELD NAME.

   OTHERDSN - POSITIONAL, ANY FIELD CONTAINING A DATA SET NAME,
              QUALIFIED (QUOTES) OR UNQUALIFIED (NO QUOTES) AND
              OPTIONALLY A MEMBER NAME IN PARENS.
              REGISTER NOTATION IS VALID FOR THIS FIELD.

   TARGETDSN- POSITIONAL, THE NAME OF THE FIELD TO RECEIVE THE DATA SET
              NAME BUILT FROM THE INPUT FIELD OR FIELDS.
              REGISTER NOTATION IS VALID FOR THIS FIELD.

   TARGETMBR- POSITIONAL, THE NAME OF THE FIELD TO RECEIVE THE MEMBER
              NAME BUILT FROM THE INPUT FIELD.
              REGISTER NOTATION IS VALID FOR THIS FIELD.

   NOVERIFY - THIS KEYWORD INDICATES THAT THE DATA SET NAME AND OPTIONAL
              MEMBER SHOULD BE CREATED FROM THE INPUT FIELDS, BUT NO
              VERIFICATION OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE DATA SET AND MEMBER
              SHOULD BE PERFORMED.

   THIS MACRO HAS 4 UNIQUE FUNCTIONS -

   1  - CHECK THE FIRST POSITION OF 'OTHERDSN' FOR A '^' OR A X'40'
        (BLANK) OR LESS. IF THIS CONDITION IS TRUE, THEN 'OTHERDSN'
        WILL NOT BE USED TO BUILD THE DSN.

        IF THE ABOVE CONDITIONS ARE NOT TRUE, THE 'OTHERDSN' FIELD
        WILL BE USED TO BUILD A DATA SET NAME.

        EXAMPLES:

        OTHER DSN                     TARGET DSN          TARGET MBR

        Z.DATA                        (ZPREFIX).Z.DATA    (BLANKS)

   2  -  IF 'OTHERDSN' IS NOT USED TO BUILD THE DATA SET NAME, THEN
         PROJECT GROUP TYPE AND MEMBER WILL BE USED.

   3  -  AFTER THE DATA SET NAME IS BUILT, THE FORMAT 1 DSCB WILL BE
         OBTAINED. THE FORMAT 1 WILL BE PLACED IN A WORKAREA PROVIDED
         BY THE 'SPFCMDS' MACRO. THIS WORKAREA INCLUDES THE IECSDSL1
         MACRO TO ALLOW REFERENCE TO THE FORMAT 1 DSCB BY THE ACTUAL
         FIELD NAMES.

   4  -  IF THE DATA SET IS A PDS, AND A MEMBER NAME IS SPECIFIED,
         A BLDL WILL BE ISSUED TO DETERMINE IF THE MEMBER EXISTS.

   IF THE KEYWORD PARAMETER, NOVERIFY, IS SPECIFIED, STEPS 3 AND 4
   ABOVE WILL BE BYPASSED.

   REGISTERS UPON RETURN FROM THE MACRO:

   R0   - 00 INDICATES THAT THE DATA SET NAME WAS BUILT FROM PROJECT
             GROUP AND TYPE FIELDS.
          04 INDICATES THAT THE DATA SET NAME WAS BUILT FROM THE OTHER
             DSN FIELD.

   R15  - 00 VALID DATA SET AND MEMBER.
          04 MEMBER DOES NOT EXIST.
          08 DATA SET HAS BEEN MIGRATED, FORMAT 1 DSCB AND BLDL COULD
             NOT BE PROVIDED BECAUSE IT WOULD CAUSE RECALL OF THE
             DATA SET.
          12 DATA SET NOT CATALOGED.
          16 DATA SET NOT ON VOLUME AS INDICATED BY THE CATALOG.
          20 BLDL COULD NOT BE ACCOMPLISHED BECAUSE THE DATA SET IS IN
             USE BY ANOTHER JOB.
          24 VOLUME IS NOT MOUNTED
          28 SOMETHING IS INVALID !!!

   THE ONLY REQUIRED PARAMETER IS THE 'TARGETDSN' PARAMETER. ALL OTHERS
   ARE OPTIONAL, ALTHOUGH YOU MUST SPECIFY ONE OF THE INPUTS.

   WHEN TO USE SPFENQ/SPFDEQ:

   THESE MACROS ARE INTENDED TO BE USED WHEN PROCESSING MEMBERS OF A
   PARTITIONED DATA SET. VARIOUS NATIVE SPF FUNCTIONS USE ENQ/DEQ
   TO PROTECT A MEMBER, AND THE ENTIRE PDS.

   THE MEMBER IS PROTECTED WHENEVER A FUNCTION HAS CONTROL WHICH MAY
   CHANGE THE MEMBER, SUCH AS EDIT.  THE ENQ ON THE MEMBER IS USUALLY
   LONG TERM, DURING WHICH THE USER IS INTER-ACTIVELY WORKING WITH THE
   DATA.

   USING THE LONG TERM MEMBER ENQ:

   RNAME: SPFEDIT
   QNAME: DSN.,....1....,....2....,....3....,...4....MEMBER..

          SPFENQ SPFEDIT,,DSNAME,MEMBER
          LTR    R15,R15      DID WE GET THE RESOURCE ?
          BNZ    NOTAVAIL     NO - SOMEBODY ELSE HAS IT

   THE "SPFEDIT" ENQ IS CONDITIONAL, (RET=USE), AND YOU MUST CHECK THE
   RETURN CODE IN R15. THE MACRO WILL NOT WAIT FOR THE RESOURCE IF IT
   IS IN USE.

   WHEN YOU ARE DONE WITH THE MEMBER, ISSUE THE "SPFDEQ" MACRO:

          SPFDEQ SPFEDIT,,DSNAME,MEMBER

1
   THE ENTIRE PDS IS PROTECTED WHENEVER A FUNCTION HAS CONTROL WHICH
   MAY UPDATE THE DIRECTORY OF THE PDS, SUCH AS SAVE, RENAME, DELETE.
   THE ENQ ON THE ENTIRE PDS IS ONLY FOR THE DURATION OF A SINGLE
   TRANSACTION.

   USING THE SHORT TERM PDS ENQ:

   RNAME: SPFEDIT
   QNAME: DSN.,....1....,....2....,....3....,...4....

          SPFENQ ,SPFDSN,DSNAME

   THE "SPFDSN" ENQ IS NOT CONDITIONAL, THE MACRO WILL WAIT FOR THE
   RESOURCE IF IT IS IN USE, SINCE THE DURATION OF THIS ENQ IS FOR
   A SINGLE TRANSACTION.

   WHEN THE TRANSACTION COMPLETES, ISSUE THE "SPFDEQ" MACRO:

          SPFDEQ ,SPFDSN,DSNAME

   YOU MAY WISH TO ISSUE BOTH ENQS FOR A FUNCTION, SINGLE TRANSACTION,
   WHICH MAY UPDATE BOTH A MEMBER AND THE DIRECTORY, SUCH AS A MOVE
   OR COPY FUNCTION.

          SPFENQ SPFEDIT,SPFDSN,DSNAME,MEMBER
          LTR    R15,R15      DID WE GET THE RESOURCE ?
          BNZ    NOTAVAIL     NO - SOMEBODY ELSE HAS IT

   THE CONDITIONAL ENQ (SPFEDIT), IS REQUESTED FIRST, AND ONLY UPON
   SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION WILL THE UNCONDITIONAL ENQ (SPFDSN) BE ISSUED.

   WHEN THE TRANSACTION COMPLETES, ISSUE THE "SPFDEQ" MACRO:

          SPFDEQ SPFEDIT,SPFDSN,DSNAME,MEMBER


   INVOKING FROM BATCH:

   YOU MAY INVOKE THESE MACROS FROM A BATCH PROGRAM, HOWEVER, YOU MUST
   REMEMBER TO INCLUDE THE "SPFCMDS" MACRO SINCE SEVERAL FIELDS OF THIS
   MACRO ARE REFERENCED BY "SPFENQ/SPFDEQ". YOU MAY LIMIT THE EXPANSION
   PF "SPFCMDS" TO THOSE FIELDS REQUIRED BY "SPFENQ/SPFDEQ" BY CODING"

               SPFCMDS   ENQDEQ=ONLY

   ALSO, DO NOT ISSUE ANY LONG TERM "SPFDSN" ENQS FROM BATCH, SINCE THIS
   MAY LOCK OUT SPF USERS.

   GENERATE 'DC' (DEFINE CONSTANT) INSTRUCTIONS FOR ALL THE VARIABLES
   REQUESTED. EACH NAME WILL HAVE THE LENGTH SPECIFIED IN THE 'LL'
   FIELD.

   IT WILL OPTIONALLY 'NOT' GENERATE THE 'DC'S IF 'DC=NO' IS CODED.
   THE ONLY TIME YOU WOULD NOT WANT THE 'DC'S GENERATED IS IF THE
   FIELD IS GENERATED BY SOME OTHER MACRO OR PRE-DEFINED IN A SPECIFIC
   PLACE IN THE PROGRAM.

   EXAMPLES -

   (LABEL)   SPFVDEF 44,(CMNBBDSN,DSNAME,SAVEDSN)
   (LABEL)   SPFVDEF 8,(CMNBBPRJ,CMNBBLIB,CMNBBTYP,ZPREFIX,ZUSER)
   (LABEL)   SPFVDEF 1,(CMNBBAA),DC=NO

   SYNTAX -

   (LABEL)  SPFVDEF (NAME1,NAME2,NAME3, ...  NAMEN)

   NAMEX     - THE NAME OF THE VARIABLE TO BE DELETED.


   THE MACRO GENERATES CODE TO DELETE VARIABLES. IT IS DESIGNED TO BE
   USED BY SUB-ROUTINES THAT ISSUE 'SPFVDEF' MACROS. SUB-ROUTINES MUST
   DELETE VARIABLES THEY DEFINE IN ORDER TO INSURE CORRECT PROCESSING
   ON MULTIPLE CALLS TO THE SUB-ROUTINE.


   EXAMPLES -

   (LABEL)   SPFVDEL (CMNBBDSN,DSNAME,SAVEDSN)

                              SPFVGET/SPFVPUT

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------

   SYNTAX -

   (LABEL)  SPFVGET (NAME1,NAME2,NAME3, ...  NAMEN),POOL
   (LABEL)  SPFVPUT (NAME1,NAME2,NAME3, ...  NAMEN),POOL

   NAMEX     - THE NAME OF THE VARIABLE FIELD.

   POOL      - SHARED OR PROFILE

   THE VARIABLES MUST BE DEFINED TO SPF VIA THE 'VDEFINE' FUNCTION.
   THERE IS NO RESTRICTION ON ORDER OF THE NAMES OR THE SIZE OF THE
   FIELDS THEY REPRESENT.

                    PROGRAMMING CONSIDERATIONS

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------


 SPFCMDS MACRO -

   THIS MACRO GENERATES ALL THE CONSTANTS FOR SPF SERVICES.
   IT ALSO CONTAINS SOME WORKAREAS USED BY OTHER SPF MACROS, THESE
   WORKAREAS MAY ALSO BE USED BY YOUR CODE.
   SPFDBWRD - A DOUBLE WORD
   SPFDSCB  - THE AREA FOR A FORMAT 1 DSCB
   SPFBLIST - THE AREA FOR A BLDL
   SPFBDCB  - THE DCB FOR A PDS - USED FOR BLDL
   SPFREGS  - 16 FULLWORD REGISTER SAVE AREA
   SPFTRT   - 256 BYTE AREA FOR TRANSLATE AND TEST (TRT)

 MESSAGES -

   2 VARIABLES ARE DEFINED BY THE 'SPFINIT' MACRO FOR DISPLAYING
   MESSAGES. THESE VARIABLES ARE &LMSG (LONG MESSAGE) AND &SMSG
   (SHORT MESSAGE). THESE VARIABLES ARE DISPLAYED BY MESSAGE 'CMN000'.

   TO DISPLAY A MESSAGE ON A PANEL, MOVE TEXT TO BOTH &SMGS AND &LMSG
   AND THEN DISPLAY MESSAGE 'CMN000'.

 TEMPORARY DATA SETS -

   TEMPORARY DATA SET NAMES SHOULD BE BUILT USING THE 'SPFTEMP' MACRO.

   1 - ATTEMPT TO ALLOCATE THE DATA SET AS IF IT EXISTS, SHR, OLD, MOD.
       SET THE BLKSIZE, LRECL, AND RECFM TO YOUR NEEDS.
   2 - IF IT DOES NOT EXIST, CREATE IT WITH A DISP=(NEW,CATLG,CATLG).
   3 - USE A LAST QUALIFIER OF THE FOLLOWING FORMAT:
       .TEMP1 THROUGH .TEMPX
       ALWAYS STARTING WITH TEMP1 AND PROCEEDING SEQUENTIALLY IF 2 OR
       MORE DATA SETS ARE REQUIRED CONCURRENTLY.
   4 - ALLOCATE IN BLOCKS, PRIMARY=10 AND SECONDARY=50
   5 - ALWAYS CODE THE 'RLSE' OPTION, FOR BOTH NEW AND EXISTING
       ALLOCATIONS.

 DDNAMES -

   IN ORDER TO AVOID A CONFLICT OF DDNAMES WHEN THE SAME DIALOG
   MANAGER IS INVOKED FROM BOTH SIDES OF SPLIT SCREEN, DO NOT HARD
   CODE DDNAMES IN YOUR DIALOG MANAGERS. DYNAMIC ALLOCATION WILL
   PROVIDE A DDNAME, IF REQUESTED. THIS IS THE "RETDD=" PARAMETER
   ON THE 'SPFALLOC' MACRO.

   MOST IBM UTILITIES AND COMPILERS PROVIDE THE ABILITY TO CHANGE THE
   STANDARD DDNAMES VIA A PARM PASSED TO THE PROGRAM.

 PANELS/MENUS

   TRY TO MAKE PANELS SIMILAR TO THE IBM SUPPLIED PANELS.

   USE PROJECT, GROUP, TYPE, MEMBER, AND OTHER DATA SET NAME WHERE
   APPLICABLE.

   ALWAYS LEAVE THE 3RD LINE BLANK, THIS IS WHERE THE LONG MESSAGE
   APPEARS.

   THE FIRST LINE, HEADING, SHOULD BE HIGH INTENSITY

   ALL PANELS SHOULD HAVE THE "COMMAND ===>" LINE IN HIGH INTENSITY.
