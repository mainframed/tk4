NOTE FOR SS0104 PROGRAM (A TAPE MAPPING PROGRAM FROM FLORIDA POWER)

  This is an ancient tape mapping program from Florida Power Company
  which is used to measure the footages on the CBT Tapes.  All footages
  from any tape or cartridge are considered as if they were 6250 bpi.
  This is a change I made for my convenience.  To fix the code properly,
  see label EXCP in the code.
                                          S. Golob    08/12/96

  P.S. See File 299 TAPEMAP program for code to measure footages
       on 3480 cartridges (as if uncompressed).

  If you've made proper fixes, kindly send the code to me, so I can
  update this file in your name.  Thank you.
