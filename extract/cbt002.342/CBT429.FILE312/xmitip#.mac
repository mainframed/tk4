Installation

To install this REXX program:

0. Unzip the file

1. Upload the file XMITIP.XMIT to your OS/390 system via a binary file
   transfer into a dataset with RECFM=FB and LRECL=80

2. Issue a TSO RECEIVE INDS(XMITIP.XMIT) to convert the file into a PDS
   - at the RECEIVE prompt just hit the ENTER key and hlq.XMITIP.PDS
     will be created.

3. Issue while in TSO EXEC 'hlq.XMITIP.PDS(RECEIVE)' EXEC This will
   expand the members EXEC and PANELS into partitioned datasets. IF
   you do not have PROFILE PREFIX enabled you may need to edit this
   exec.

4. Edit the REXX (XMITIPCU) code and review/update each section to
   make the necessary local customizations for your shop.  The main
   things you will need to look at are the NJE node name and the name
   of the SMTP started task.

5. Copy the updated REXX execs into a production library where other
   REXX execs are stored. Copy members into your rexx library.
   Then copy the panel into your production ISPF panels
   dataset.  If this is your first time then copy exec XMITIPCU into
   your rexx exec library - otherwise check to see if the new version
   of XMITIPCU requires changes to your copy.  Note the sample rexx
   exec GET and decide if you want to use it.

6. Test it out using the IVPJOB (but you must tailor this for your shop)

7. Update the MSWord or RTF document for your site

8. Tell your users

9. Let me know of any suggestions, comments, bug reports, and perhaps an
   complaint.

10. After you install this please send me a note to tell me what you
    think and if you want to be included on the distribution list for
    future updates.  You can use the following command from ISPF to
    e-mail me:
