This version of LSTPROC was modified by me (Sam Golob) to accommodate
our hokey JES2 proc that has rather awkward symbolics.  I asked Lionel
to whip me up a version of the LSTPROC he originally sent me, which
would handle symbolics.  And he actually did so, in short order (for
which I thank him).  His version was created "sight unseen" to our JES2
proc, and I had to tweak it a bit, so it would put a period in between
2 qualifiers.  So this version is "unofficial".  I just put it here,
because I want to help somebody who needs it.  Just don't blame Lionel
for any defects--it isn't exactly what he sent me.

The exec works by reading your JES2 proc, and allocating ddnames to
your TSO session, that correspond to the PROC00 ddnames, etc.  Then
it invokes ISRDDN, so you can browse the concatenations or edit them
under ISPF.  It works, provided that it can read the dataset names
in your JES2 proc.  Use it in good health!
