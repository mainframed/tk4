Distributing Reports from Batch Jobs via E-Mail

How many times have you wanted to have 'that' report in your e-mail
inbox instead of having to wait for it to be printed and then
delivered to you?

This document describes a simple process that can be used by any
batch job to distribute reports as e-mail attachments to electronic
mail addresses. You can distribute from one to n files to from one
to n addresses. The attachment will be translated from EBCDIC to
ASCII during the electronic mail processing so only text files
should be sent (note that special characters may not translate
correctly so you should test your file before implementing this
process into a production job).

Support is also available to send a file attachment as a binary
attachment. This option is used for files that are already in ASCII
or should be transported in binary format such as a PKZIP file
(created by PKZIP/MVS on OS/390).

The benefit is that you can send reports, using the REPORT keyword,
as rich text format (rtf) documents, and specify landscape or
portrait orientation as well as the font size. This approach is
useful as the batch, formerly printed reports, arrive in the users
mail box in a format similar to the printed report. You can also
send reports as HTML files so they can be viewed using a standard
web browser.

This document is in three parts. Part 1 documents how to use the
XMITIP REXX Application to electronically distribute messages and/or
text files (as text attachments) to electronic mail addresses via
the intranet or internet. Part 2 documents how to view the
attachment on the workstation. Part 3 documents how to customize
your own application to do this.  Part I. Using the XMITIP REXX
Application The basic process is shown in this example:

//xxx JOB ...
//TSOB EXEC PGM=IKJEFT1B
//SYSEXECDD DISP=SHR,DSN=rexx.exec
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
//SYSTSPRT DD SYSOUT=*
//SYSTSIN DD *

FILE 'report.data.set' -
SUBJECT 'subject line' FROM reply-to-address
ISPF Dialog
If the XMITIP command is executed without any options while under
ISPF then the ISPF Dialog will be invoked. This dialog is a simple
front-end to the XMITIP application and can be used to 'model' a
planned batch usage. The ISPF Panel is shown below:

------------------------------  E-Mail Dialog  -------------------------

Notes on the example and syntax explanation:

PGM=IKJEFT1B
This program is used instead of IKJEFT01 because it
will pass a return code if it is non-zero.
Rexx.exec
The dataset that contains the XMITIP REXX Program
NCal: SYS2.REXX.EXECSCal: SYS1.USER.REXX
Hawaii: OPS.USER.REXX
Userid@domain.com

Or
(u1@domain.com u2@domain.com .)

Or
First Last <first.last@domain.com>

Or
"First Last" <first.last@domain.com>

Or
("first last" <first.last@addr> "first last2"
<first.last2@addr>)


*list-id

Or
*

This is the electronic mail address to receive the e-mail.

Two formats are allowed. Without parenthesis a single e-
mail address may be specified.If more than one address
is desired then enclose the addresses within parenthesis
with a space separating each address.

Or the address may be in the format:

First Last <first.last@address>
or
"First Last" <first.last@address>

(Note that this form of addressing is not displayed
(honored) by all e-mail clients.Lotus Notes does not
honor the "First Last" when displaying the note.

*list-id is any name, with a preceding asterisk, that you
want used in the TO: field of the mail envelope.
Typically used with BCC so that all the recipients don't
see the long (or short) list of who else is receiving the e-
mail.

If using and AddressFile or AddressFileDD then an
address of * here is allowed as it will be replaced by the
addresses in the file.
AddressFile dsname
This keyword defines a DSName that contains a list of
keywords and addresses..

This sequential file has the following syntax:

        To address
        CC address
        BCC address
        * comment

Note that the address may be in the format defined in the
TO keyword.

Only one address per line is supported. The process is
case insensitive. If a *list-id is used and any TO
statements are found, any address defined will be
converted to a CC. If an * is used in the address then any
TO statements will be used to replace that * in the
address.
AddressFileDD ddname
This keyword defines a DDName that contains a list of
keywords and addresses..

See AddressFile for information on the layout of this
file.
ASA

If DCB of the attachment is RECFM=*A then
ASA is applied as well.
Convert ASA Carriage Control to ASCII Carriage
Control or when using the REPORT keyword convert to
RTF statements. Also applies to HTML documents.
Specifically:

1 - Skip to new page is changed to a Form Feed
0 - Skip 2 lines is changed to insert a blank line before
the data line
- - Skip 3 lines are changed to insert 2 blank lines before
the data line.
+ - merge current line into prior line
blank - single space
other - treated as a '0' (skip 2 lines)

all data is shifted into column 1.
BCC user@domain.com
Or
BCC (u1@domain.com u2@domain.com .)
Or
BCC First Last <first.last@address>
Or
BCC "First Last" <first.last@address>
or
BCC ("first last" <first.last@addr> "first last2"
<first.last2@addr>)
This is the electronic 'blind-carbon

Two formats are allowed. Without parenthesis a single e-
mail address may be specified. If more than one address
is desired enclose the addresses within parenthesis with a
space separating each address.

Typically used with an address of *list-id* format.
CC user@domain.com
Or
CC (u1@domain.com u2@domain.com .)
Or
CC First Last <first.last@address>
Or
CC "First Last" <first.last@address>
or
CC ("first last" <first.last@addr> "first last2"
<first.last2@addr>)
This is the electronic 'carbon

Two formats are allowed. Without parenthesis a single e-
mail address may be specified. If more than one address
is desired enclose the addresses within parenthesis with a
space separating each address.
FILE dataset-name

Or

FILE (dataset-name1 dataset-name2 .)
Defines the dataset or datasets that you want to e-mail as
attachments. The dataset(s) will be e-mailed as text and
will be translated from EBCDIC to ASCII so verify that
the report will translate usably before making this
production.Be conscious of the size as well as the larger
the dataset the more time it takes to e-mail and the more
space it takes in the user's inbasket.

Note that the dataset-name should be fully qualified with
single quotes. Without the use of quotes the dataset-
name will have the userid under which the batch job was
submitted appended as the high level qualifier.

A dsname of *create* may be used when under ISPF to
create and edit a new dataset.  Helpful with html or rtf
option to dynamically create a attachment.
FILEDD ddn1

Or

FILEDD (ddn1 ddn2 ..)
Defines a pre-allocated DD statement that references
sequential data. This dataset may be temporary, a
member of a PDS, a GDG, or a concatenation of multiple
sequential datasets.If more than one ddname is specified
then the ddnames must be coded within parenthesis.
FILEDESC file-description
or
FILEDESC file-name/file-description
or
FILEDESC (file-desc1 file-desc2 ..)
or
FILEDESC (name/desc name2/desc2)
A short file description specified with no spaces and not
in quotes.  Or a filename/filedescription

e.g.

FILEDESC process-document
or
FILEDESC (desc1 file-desc2 x filedesc-4)

where x (or X) may be used as a placeholder if there is
no description for a particular file)
FROM reply-to-address
Or
FROM first last <first.last@addr>
Or
FROM "first last" <first.last@addr>
Defines an e-mail address that the recipient can use with
the reply function of their e-mail package to send
questions, comments, or ?

If this keyword is not used then the reply address will be
the userid on the NJE node where the application is
executed at the host name where the smtp server
executes.

e.g. user%njenode@host-name.domain
MARGIN left/right/top/bottom
Defines the margins for the REPORT attachments in
Inches (e.g. 8.5 for 8 + inches).
MSGDS data-set-name

Or

MSGDS *
This keyword defines a sequential dataset (or member of
a partitioned dataset) which contains the text of a
message to be e-mailed.

If * is coded then (1) you must be under ISPF and then
(2) the ISPF Editor will be invoked to create a note.
MSGDD ddname
This keyword defines the DDname, which references a
sequential dataset (or member of a partitioned dataset),
which contains the text of a message to be e-mailed.
MSG72
Use only the first 72 characters per record in the
message.  This option can be used to ignore sequence
numbers in the message for batch jobs.
NOMSG
Indicates that no message text is to be e-mailed. Use this
when you are sending just a file attachment(s) and have
no explanatory text.
NOCONFIRM
Indicates that you do not want the REXX program to
generate few lines of confirmation text that it has
generated the requested e-mail.
RECEIPTaddress
Or
RECEIPT first last <first.last@addr>
Or
RECEIPT "first last" <first.last@addr>
Defines the e-mail address to be used to send a receipt
when the mail is received by the user. This option does
not work with all e-mail clients.
REPLYTO address
Or
FROM first last <first.last@addr>
Or
FROM "first last" <first.last@addr>
Defines the e-mail address to be used when the user does
a reply. This may be different than the address defined in
the FROM keyword.
REPORT style/font-size/paper

Or

REPORT (style/font-size/paper style/font-
size/paper .)
This keyword and parameters affect the datasets defined
in FILE and FILEDD. The designated datasets are
converted to Rich Text Format (RTF) format and will
open in your word processor (e.g. Microsoft Word) using
the specified characteristics.See the ASA keyword.

The font-size may also be specified as BIN or HTML.If
BIN then the file is attached as a binary attachment with
no conversion. If HTML then the file is converted to
HTML (using ASA conversion as well if specified).

The values are:

Style is P (portrait) or L (landscape) or X to ignore or xx
        Where xxx is any file-type to use (e.g. xls)
Font-Size is the size of the Courier font (e.g. 9) and is
optional. May also be BIN, RTF or HTML.
Paper is the size of paper to use:
        LET or LTR for Letter (8.5x11)
        LEG or LGL for Legal (8.5 x 14)
        A4 for A4 (8.27x11.691)

If HTML is coded then the paper parameter is the text
color. If color is coded as color1-color2 then the color1
is the background color and color2 is the text color.
Colors can be abbreviated.

Color      Abbrev   Color     Abbrev
Aqua       A        Navy      N
Black      Bla      Olive     O
Blue       Blu      Purple    P
Fuchsia    F        Red       R
Gray      Gra       Silver    S
Green     Gre       Teal      T
Lime      L         White     W
Maroon    M         Yellow    Y

Each set 'maps' to the relative dsn in FILE and FILEDD
with dsn's in FILE coming before those in FILEDD.

Style of X is used when multiple files are being
processed and you want one to take the default of no
RTF formatting.

A file-type will be used to define the attached file as that
type and no RTF formatting will occur.

If the style contains a period (e.g. test.txt) then it will be
used for the attachment file name.  No conversion will
occur unless the font/type is RTF, HTML, or BIN
(** Suggest using FILEDESC for this)
SIG dsname
The dsname contains a signature block that will be used
and appended to any Message text.
SUBJECT 'subject text'
Enclosed within single (') or double (") quotes is your
subject.  If using single (') quotes then you can include
double (") quotes within your subject and vice versa.

The subject can contain 2 special keywords:

&DATE or &DATE-n
&DAY or &DAY-n

Note that these keywords can be repeated:

e.g. Subject "Reports for &date-7 to &date"
The minimum required syntax is:

XMITIP user@domain.com MSGDS dataset.name

Or
XMITIP user@domain.com NOMSG FILE dataset.name

The sample JCL is an execution of the TSO Batch Terminal Monitor
Program (or TMP). The dash (-) is used to indicate a continuation
follows when a command cannot fit on a single card image.

Dataset coding conventions are the same as for any TSO Batch TMP
invocation. The dataset must be fully qualified within single
quotation marks otherwise the userid under which the job is
submitted will be appended as the high level qualifier. Members of
partitioned datasets may be distributed as well by coding the member
name within parenthesis as is the common JCL coding standard.
Examples:

Example 1.Sending a member of a partitioned dataset with no message
text and a short subject to 2 users.

//TSOB EXEC PGM=IKJEFT1B
//SYSEXECDD DISP=SHR,DSN=rexx.exec
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
//SYSTSPRT DD SYSOUT=*
//SYSTSIN DD *
%XMITIP (user1@domain.com user2@domain.com) nomsg file -
        'hlq.data.set(member)' -
        subject 'send a file but no message'

Example 2.Sending a message but no file to 1 user.

//TSOB EXEC PGM=IKJEFT1B
//SYSEXECDD DISP=SHR,DSN=rexx.exec
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
//SYSTSPRT DD SYSOUT=*
//SYSTSIN DD *
%XMITIP user@domain.com msgds my.message.text subject 'urgent message'

Example 3.Sending example 2 with 2 CCs with a From of my Lotus Notes
e-mail so questions about what I'm sending can be sent there.

//TSOB EXEC PGM=IKJEFT1B

//TSOB EXEC PGM=IKJEFT1B
//SYSEXECDD DISP=SHR,DSN=rexx.exec
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
//SYSTSPRT DD SYSOUT=*
//SYSTSIN DD *
%XMITIP user@domain.com nomsg file 'hlq.data.set(member)' -
        subject 'pds member'

Example 5.Sending a dataset in Landscape with a 9 point font.

//TSOB EXEC PGM=IKJEFT1B

Example 7. Sending a dataset as a file attachment and using a
AddressFile dataset:

//TSOB EXEC PGM=IKJEFT1B
//SYSEXECDD DISP=SHR,DSN=rexx.exec
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*
//SYSTSPRT DD SYSOUT=*
//SYSTSIN DD *
%XMITIP user@domain.com nomsg file 'hlq.data.set(member)' -

Where 'hlq.data.set(address)' contains the following:

To user1@domain.com
CC user2@domain.org
Cc user3@domain.ca
Bcc user4@domain.uk

Example 8. Sending a SPOOL file as a text attachment:

What this example does is:

? create SYSUT2 in SPOOL for printing
? batch SDSF
? set PREfix to jobname
? blank out OWNER
