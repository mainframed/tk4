This dataset contains 4 tools each in a TSO Transmit format.  Member
RECEIVE can be used to take each of these tool members and create
individual partitioned datasets.  The exception to this is member
RNEWS which is in IEBUPDTE format and which you will need to
install differently from the other members.

To run the RECEIVE member issue:

    RECEIVE INDS(this.dataset.name(RECEIVE)) EX

This will create 3 partitioned datasets:

   userid.FILE312.FTPB.PDS
   userid.FILE312.PRINT.PDS
   userid.FILE312.XMITIP.PDS

Each of these datasets will have a $DOC member which will explain how to
install that tool.

These tools are provided by:
