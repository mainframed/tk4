From: Lionel B Dyck <Lionel.B.Dyck@kp.org>

I'm releasing version 3.10 of this handy tool.  This e-mail is to my
distribution list with a copy of the code.  A similar announcement
will go out shortly on various listservs.

This update includes improvements in the ISPF Dialog mostly along
with a number of bug fixes.

A new and improved version of the XMITIP OS/390 SMTP Mail Client is
now available.

This Mail Client supports the creation of e-mail from OS/390 batch
and TSO.

To summarize the capabilities of this package:

1.  Written fully in REXX so it will run under TSO or in Batch
2.  A full, user friendly, ISPF interface comes with it
3.  Allows the creation of e-mail to any internet (smtp) address
4.  Support multiple recipients (to, cc, bcc)
5.  Supports multiple file attachments
    - plain text (default)
    - convert to html
    - convert to rich text format (rtf) that can be opened by
      MS Word or other word processor
    - binary option (no text conversion)
6.  support for page layout (landscape or portrait) - rtf only
7.  support for logical paper size (letter, legal, A4) - rtf only
8.  support for margins - rtf only
9.  support for font size specification - rtf only
10. support for specifying file type (e.g. .doc)
11. support for asa carriage control - html and rtf only
    - treats 1, 0, - as you would expect
    - treats + by merging current with previous line non-blank merge
    - treats other cc as 0
12. support for priority, sensitivity, and importance
13. support for a quote (murphy) in your message
14. In the ISPF Dialog
    - support for an ISPF table of all e-mail addresses used
      to select from
    - useful for testing the XMITIP command and refining it
      before implementing in a batch process
    - generates a report of what the command syntax generated is
15. Produces a report of all recipients, all files attached,
    and approximate total bytes sent
16. Easily customized for each installation

E-mail from this package has been successfully sent to MS
Exchange, MS Outlook Express, MS Outlook, Pegasus, various web
e-mail systems, Netscape e-mail client, and Lotus Notes.
