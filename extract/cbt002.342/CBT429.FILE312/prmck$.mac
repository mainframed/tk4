PARMLIB Check

This application consists of a REXX Exec and an ISPF Panel.  To use
this you need to copy the exec (choose the FB or the VB version) into
a library in your SYSPROC or SYSEXEC concatenation.  You then need to
copy the panel into a library in your ISPPLIB concatenation.

Usage is to Edit the desired member of SYS1.PARMLIB and enter the
command PRMCK.

Syntax: PRMCK cat sysres (debug

valid options are:
      ?   - will prompt for catalog and sysres
