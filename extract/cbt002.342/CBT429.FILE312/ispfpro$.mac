            ISPF Product Installation - the Easy Way

To simplify the installation of products or applications that use
ISPF a new facility is being made available.  This facility is a
REXX application that utilizes standard interface commands to setup
the ISPF environment for your product or application.  What makes
this simple is that the various elements of the application do not
have to be installed into any pre-existing libraries.  The only
pre-existing library that is updated is the production SYSPROC or
SYSEXEC where the stub routine is installed.

A caution when using this interface is that you must verify that
your product or application will work properly with it as there are
instances where this facility does not work and the products or
applications components must be installed into pre-allocated
libraries.

The stub that is referred to is a small REXX exec or CLIST that
invokes this facility which is basically a front-end to the product
or application.

Here are two examples of the stub used to invoke Fileaid.  Note that
the STEP parameter is not used since the Fileaid load library is
installed in the LINKLIST. Example 1 is using all the parameters to
define specific libraries.

Example 1:

/* REXX */
arg options

"%ispfprod applid(FAXE)",
   "scrname(Fileaid)",
   "table('sysl.fileaid.isptlib')",
   "clist('SYSL.FILEAID.CLIST.VB')" ,
   "panels('SYSL.FILEAID.ISPPLIB')" ,
   "msgs('SYSL.FILEAID.ISPMLIB')" ,
   "skels('SYSL.FILEAID.ISPSLIB')" ,
   "panel(IFAMU01) opt("options")"

In Example 2 the use of the PREFIX parameter is demonstrated which
avoids having to code most of the other parms.  Note that the PREFIX
is coded without quotes as it is the high level qualifier(s) to
which appropriate suffixes will be added and if valid used.

Example 2:

/* REXX */
arg options

"%ispfprod applid(FAXE)",
   "clist('SYSL.FILEAID.CLIST.VB')" ,
   "prefix(sysl.fileaid)" ,
   "panel(IFAMU01) opt("options")"

The PREFIX parameter is a powerful shortcut to creating the stub to
invoke your ISPF application.  When used it will automatically find
and use all the following libraries:

       Suffix    DDNAME

       CLIST     SYSPROC
       EXEC      SYSEXEC
       ISPCLIB   SYSPROC
       ISPPLIB   ISPPLIB
       ISPSLIB   ISPSLIB
       ISPTLIB   ISPTLIB
       LLIB      ISPLLIB
       LOAD      ISPLLIB
       PANELS    ISPPLIB
       SKELS     ISPSLIB
       STEPLIB   STEPLIB
       TABLES    ISPTLIB


The syntax for the ISPFPROD facility is:

%ISPFPROD
    APPLID(ISPF Application ID)
    SCRNAME(ISPF Screen Name)
    CLIST(CLIST Library or Libraries)
    EXEC(REXX Library or Libraries)
    LLIB(ISPF Load Library or Libraries)
    STEP(Steplib Library or Libraries)
    MSGS(ISPF Messages Library or Libraries)
    PANELS(ISPF Panels Library or Libraries)
    SKELS(ISPF Skeleton Library or Libraries)
    TABLE(ISPF Table Library or Libraries)
    PREFIX(high-level-qualifier for libraries)
    CMD(command options)
    or
    PGM(program) PARM(parm)
    or
    PANEL(panel-name) OPT(option)

If you are using the standard system SYSPROC or SYSEXEC
concatenation of libraries then you will find this facility
available in all Kaiser OS/390 environments (National Production,
National Development, Hawaii, Northern California Production and
Northern California Development, as well as NSYS and RSYS/S10D).
