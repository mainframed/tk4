Subject:        Cross-Post: E-Mail from OS/390 (XMITIP) Update

This announcement is being cross posted to 5 listserv's where
interest has been expressed in XMITIP.  Thus please forgive me if
you receive this multiple times.

It is available at http://www.geocities.com/lbdyck
XMITIP allows the user to send e-mail text and file attachments from
OS/390 TSO or OS/390 Batch via SMTP.  It  has been updated with new
functionality and improved usability.  The updates to this release
are:

? Support for zip'ing a file before attaching it
? can be zip'd after rtf or html conversion
? binary attachments can be zip d as well
? support for both ISPZIP and PKZIP/MVS
? Improved keyword syntax
? Improved file attachment specification ISPF dialog
? additional diagnostics and a debug option available
? IVP job provided in the install pds
? Support for Interlinks TCPAccess

To summarize the capabilities of this package:
1.      Written fully in REXX so it will run under TSO or in Batch
        (under the batch TMP)
2.      A full, user friendly, ISPF interface comes with it
3.      Allows the creation of e-mail to any internet (smtp) address

  other word processor

? option to zip the file before attaching
6.      support for page layout (landscape or portrait) - rtf only
7.      support for logical paper size (letter, legal, A4) - rtf only
8.      support for margins - rtf only
9.      support for font size specification - rtf only
10.     support for specifying file type (e.g. .doc)
11.     support for asa carriage control - html and rtf only
? treats 1, 0, - as you would expect
? treats + by merging current with previous line non-blank merge
? treats other cc as 0
12.     support for priority, sensitivity, and importance
13.     support for a quote (murphy) in your message
14.     In the ISPF Dialog
? support for an ISPF table of all e-mail addresses used to select from
? useful for testing the XMITIP command and refining it before
  implementing in a batch process
? generates a report of what the command syntax generated is
15.     Produces a report of all recipients, all files attached, and
        approximate total bytes sent
16.     Easily customized for each installation
