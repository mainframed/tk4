FTPBATCH.ZIP contains the ISPF Dialog known as FTPBatch.  This name
originated when the dialog originated as it was originally intended
to simplify the creation of batch JCL to invoke FTP.  This has grown
significantly since then but the name hasn't changed.

To install you need to:

1.  Unzip (which you obviously have done since you are reading this)
2.  Upload ftpb.xmit to your MVS system using the following
    characteristics
    - binary
    - RECFM=FB
    - LRECL=80
3.  After the upload issue on TSO:
    RECEIVE INDS(upload.dsn)

then read the $doc member of the resulting PDS.
