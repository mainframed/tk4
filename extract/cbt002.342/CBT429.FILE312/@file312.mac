//*        FTPB - The File Transfer Protocol Batch ISPF Dialog      *
//*                                                                 *
//*     This ISPF dialog provides a simple to use ISPF interface    *
//*     for using the TCP/IP FTP function to transfer data sets     *
//*     from the current MVS host system to other host systems      *
//*     that support a TCP/IP FTP Server (e.g.  MVS, VM, OS/2,      *
//*     most Unix, ...).                                            *
//*                                                                 *
//*     The dialog presents the user with a simple ISPF panel       *
//*     from which to specify the source (original) data set,       *
//*     the target host, optionally the name of the target data     *
//*     set if it is different from the source, and signon          *
//*     information (userid and password).  Once this               *
//*     information is complete the dialog generates the            *
//*     necessary JCL and FTP statements to allow the user to       *
//*     execute the FTP in the foreground (execpt for load          *
//*     library transfers) or to submit the JCL for a batch         *
//*     execution of FTP.  Prior to submission the user is          *
//*     allowed to review and change (edit) the generated JCL       *
//*     and FTP control statements if they desire.                  *
//*                                                                 *

//*     How many times have you wanted to have 'that' report in     *
//*     your e-mail inbox instead of having to wait for it to       *
//*     be printed and then delivered to you?                       *
//*                                                                 *
//*     This document describes a simple process that can be        *
//*     used by any batch job to distribute reports as e-mail       *
//*     attachments to electronic mail addresses.  You can          *
//*     distribute from one to n files to from one to n             *
//*     addresses.  The attachment will be translated from          *
//*     EBCDIC to ASCII during the electronic mail processing       *
//*     so only text files should be sent (note that special        *
//*     characters may not translate correctly so you should        *
//*     test your file before implementing this process into a      *
//*     production job).                                            *
//*                                                                 *
//*     The benefit is that you can send reports, using the         *
//*     REPORT keyword, as rich text format (rtf) documents and     *
//*     specify landscape or portrait orientation as well as        *
//*     the font size.  This approach is useful as the batch,       *
//*     formerly printed reports, arrive in the users mail box      *
//*     in a format similar to the printed report.                  *
//*                                                                 *
