This file contains a user friendly front-end to IBM's BookManager
Read/MVS.  It is designed to make it easier for your users to use
the large number of IBM and other softcopy publications.

To install:

1.  Unzip this file (you've probably already done this)

2.  Do a binary upload to MVS into a RECFM=FB LRECL=80 dataset

3.  Process the dataset with IEBUPDTE into a PDS with RECFM=FB
    LRECL=80

4.  Follow the instructions in the PDS.  Some members will
    require that you issue TSO RECEIVE INDS(dsname(member)) to
    extract into something that you can use.

If you find this useful, have questions or comments (or
complaints) please let me know.
