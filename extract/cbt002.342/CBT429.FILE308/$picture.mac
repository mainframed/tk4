Here is a snippet from the console:

                        SYS3D.BOOLE.T2BADATA.BKP
 00  08.30.47 JOB31326  TMS014  IEF234E K 03E6
 IEE612I CN=SVT2MSTR DEVNUM=0016 SYS=SVT2


 IEE163I MODE= RD-HNR401/0996-SP6.0.4

The mod affects the bottom line.  The "extra" space in the messages
is limited. I think this is as much text as can be added.  One
version of the zap used to have the SMF id, but with named consoles
(see the IEE612I) that feature became less useful.
