        FUNCTION OF CLISTS:
           CONVERT A LIST OF DATASET NAMES TO DISK-TO-TAPE BACKUP JCL.
 
        SHORT DESCRIPTION:
           ONCE YOU HAVE A SET OF CLISTS LIKE THESE, YOU'LL WONDER
           WHAT YOU EVER DID WITHOUT THEM .
 
           THIS FAMILY OF CLISTS SOLVES AN OLD, NAGGING PROBLEM OF
           IBM PROGRAMMERS, NAMELY, THAT OF BACKING UP A LARGE
           NUMBER OF PDS'ES AND SEQUENTIAL DATASETS TO TAPE.  THE
           USUAL WAYS OF DOING THIS REQUIRES SETTING UP A PROC, AND
           CODING A LARGE NUMBER OF EXECUTIONS OF THE PROC, FOR
           DIFFERENT DATASETS. YOU HAVE TO KEEP TRACK OF THE FILE
           NUMBERS ON TAPE, AND IT'S A BIG PAIN IN THE (YOU FILL IN
           THE BLANK), AT ITS EASIEST.
 
           WITH "BACKEMUP" CLISTS YOU JUST HAVE TO MAKE A LIST OF
           THE DATASETS ON A CARD-IMAGE FILE, RUN A CLIST AGAINST
           THE LIST, AND BANG-ZOOM, IN A FEW SECONDS, YOU HAVE YOUR
           IEBCOPY JCL--JUST LIKE THAT !!
 
 
        SUMMARY OF CLISTS BY CATEGORY:
 
            BACK UP PDS'ES     - GENUNLDS
            BACK UP SEQUEN     - GENGENR
            BACK UP PDS'ES
              AND SEQUEN       - GENPOPS  (LIST PDS'ES FIRST, THEN A
                                              CARD WITH "?" IN COLUMN
                                              1, THEN LIST ALL
                                              SEQUENTIAL DATASETS)
            BACK UP PDS'ES
              AND SEQUEN ON
              A GIVEN VOLUME   - GENVOL   (INPUT DATASET HAS SAME
                                              RULES AS GENPOPS -

                                              THE DATASETS DON'T HAVE
                                              TO BE CATALOGED.  )

        FURTHER HELP AND DESCRIPTION:
 
           PLEASE SEE MEMBER TSOBATV FOR GREAT ASSISTANCE IN BACKING
           UP PO AND PS DATASETS ON A GIVEN VOLUME.  OUTPUT OF THIS
           JOB IS CLOSE TO THE FORMAT USED FOR INPUT TO THE CLIST
           CALLED "GENVOL".  ONLY MINOR MASSAGING WITH ISPF EDIT
           IS NECESSARY.  "VTOC" PGM FOUND ON CBT TAPE - FILE 300.
 
           JEFF BROIDO (MY GOOD AND LOYAL FRIEND) WROTE THE ORIGINAL
           CLIST, GENUNLD.  I HAVE MODIFIED HIS ORIGINAL VERSION FOR
           SEVERAL OF MY PURPOSES, AND HAVE WRITTEN ANOTHER ONE,
           GENPOPS, THAT ADDED THE CAPABILITY OF DUMPING SEQUENTIAL
           DATASETS AFTER DOING THE PDS'ES.  I USE DAVE COLE'S DSCOPY
           PROGRAM FOR SEQUENTIAL DATASET DUMPING TO TAPE.  IT PAYS TO
           SEND DAVE COLE A HUNDRED BUCKS FOR THIS SEQUENTIAL DATASET
           COPY PROGRAM. DAVE'S ADDRESS IS:  DAVID B. COLE - RR#2 BOX
           712 - AFTON, VA. 22920 .  IT'S A REAL GEM.  OTHERWISE, YOU
           CAN REWRITE THAT CLIST FOR FTL, A SEQUENTIAL COPY PROGRAM
           ON CBT TAPE FILE 270, WHICH IS SOMEWHAT JCL-COMPATIBLE WITH
           DSCOPY.  FTL IS A FREE PROGRAM.  THE ADVANTAGE OF DSCOPY IS
           (AMONG OTHER USES IT HAS) THAT MANY FILES CAN BE COPIED
           WITHIN ONE EXEC CARD.  DSCOPY DOES NOT HAVE A LIMIT TO THE
           NUMBER OF FILES THAT CAN BE COPIED UNDER A SINGLE EXEC CARD.
           FTL HAS THE RESTRICTION THAT THE INXX, OUTXX PAIRED DDNAMES
           MUST BE NUMERIC, AND HAVE A RANGE OF 01 TO 99.  THIS LIMITS
           THE NUMBER OF DATASET COPY EXECUTIONS TO 99 UNDER THE FIRST
           SEQUENTIAL COPY EXEC CARD, AND IT REQUIRES MORE EXEC CARDS
           FOR MORE THAN 99 SEQUENTIAL FILES.
 
           MY CLISTS USE DAVE COLE'S TAPEMAP PROGRAM (ORIGINAL WAS FROM
           UCLA) WHICH IS ON CBT TAPE FILE 299.  THEY ALSO USE THE
           INIMITABLE PDS PROGRAM FROM FILE 182, AND I HAVE THE VENDOR
           PRODUCT PDSFAST, WHICH SUBSTITUTES FOR IEBCOPY WITH THE SAME
           JCL, EXCEPT FOR PROGRAM NAME.  THESE CLISTS MAY NEED TSO/E,
           BUT IF YOU'RE CLEVER, YOU CAN GET AROUND THAT (IT'S ONLY
           NEEDED DURING THE INPUT FILE READ, IN WHICH THE DATASET
           NAMES ARE CONVERTED INTO A HUGE STRING).
