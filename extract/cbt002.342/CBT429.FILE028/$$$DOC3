00031003PLEASE SEE SAMPLE CLIST INPUT IN THE SAMPINPT MEMBER OF THIS PDS.

00040001PLEASE NOTE THAT THE "BACKEMUP" CLISTS ARE USEFUL FOR DOING IEBCOPY
00050004AND SEQUENTIAL BACKUPS OF NONVSAM DATASETS ON OLD DISK PACKS WHEN
00051004CONVERTING DEVICE TYPES, SAY FROM 3330V OR 3350 TO 3380.  IT IS EASY
00060004TO GENERATE THE INPUT STREAM FOR THE "GENVOL" OR "GENVOLI" OR
00070004"GENVOLIF" CLISTS FROM THE TSO-IN-BATCH JOB TSOBATV1, WHICH IS
00080004INCLUDED IN THIS PDS.  TSOBATV1 TAKES A VTOC LIST OF ALL THE
00081004DATASETS ON THE PACK AND PUTS THE DATASET LIST IN A FORM THAT IS
00090004VERY CLOSE TO WHAT THESE CLISTS NEED FOR INPUT.
00091004 
00092004 
00093004IF YOU ARE BACKING UP ALL THE PARTITIONED AND SEQUENTIAL DATASETS ON
00094004ONE PACK, YOU CAN RUN THE GENVOLIF CLIST AGAINST THE ENTIRE LIST OF
00095005DESIRED DATASETS ON THE PACK.  WHEN THE TAPE REEL OVERFLOWS, JUST
00096005CANCEL THE JOB WITHOUT A PURGE, AND MAKE CAREFUL NOTE OF WHICH
00097005DATASETS GOT BACKED UP PROPERLY.  LOP THOSE DATASET NAMES OFF THE
00098005TOP OF THE ORIGINAL DATASET LIST, RERUN THE CLIST GENVOLIF TO
00098105GENERATE NEW JCL FOR A NEW TAPE REEL, AND CONTINUE BACKING UP THE
00099005REST OF THE DATASETS ON THE NEXT REEL.  WHEN ALL THE DATASETS ARE
00099105BACKED UP, JUST RUN A TAPEMAP JOB AGAINST THE REELS THAT GOT FILLED
00099205UP COMPLETELY.  THIS IS PAINLESS, RELATIVE TO CODING JCL TO BACK UP
00099305HUNDREDS OF SEPARATE DATASETS.  MEMBER CALLED "TAPEMAP" IN THIS PDS
00099405HAS SAMPLE JCL TO RUN THE TAPEMAP PROGRAM (FILE 299) FOR MULTIPLE
00099505TAPE VOLUMES.

00100001 
00110002I HAVE DISCOVERED THAT YOU CAN USE ALL FREEWARE TO RUN THESE CLISTS.
00120002THE SEQUENTIAL COPY PROGRAM "DSCOPY" FROM DAVE COLE, WHICH COSTS A
00130002NOMINAL FEE, BUT IS PRIVATE, CAN BE COMPLETELY REPLACED BY THE FREE
00140002PROGRAM "FTL" WHICH CAN BE FOUND ON THE CBT TAPE, FILE 270, FROM
00150002WASHINGTON STATE.  THE JCL IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT, BECAUSE FTL CAN
00160002"ONLY" COPY 99 PAIRS OF DATASETS UNDER ONE EXEC CARD, AND DSCOPY CAN
00170002COPY AN UNLIMITED NUMBER OF PAIRS.  THE DDNAMES UNDER FTL ARE
00180002SLIGHTLY MORE RESTRICTED, IN THAT THEY MUST BE NUMERIC OF THE FORM
00181002//INXX AND //OUTXX, WHERE XX RUNS FROM 01 TO 99.  DSCOPY HAS NO
00190002RESTRICTIONS ON THE FORMAT OF THE SUFFIXES TO //IN--- AND //OUT---.
00200005THEY MUST ONLY BE PAIRED, AND DSCOPY AUTOMATICALLY SORTS THE PAIRS
00210005AND DOES THE COPYING IN THE COLLATING SEQUENCE ORDER OF THE
00211005SUFFIXES.
00230002 
00240002 
00250004I HAVE REWRITTEN THE CLIST "GENPOPS" FOR THE FTL PROGRAM, CALLING
00260004IT "GENPOPSF".  "GENPOPS" BACKS UP LISTS OF CATALOGED PO AND PS
00260104DATASETS.  I HAVE ALSO REWRITTEN "GENVOL" AS "GENVOLF".  "GENVOL"
00261005BACKS UP PO AND PS DATASETS ON A SINGLE PACK, CATALOGED OR NOT
00261105CATALOGED.  "GENVOLI", WHICH IS LIKE "GENVOL", BUT WHICH INITTS THE
00262005OUTPUT TAPE FIRST, HAS BEEN REWRITTEN AS "GENVOLIF".  THIS WILL GIVE
00270005YOU AN IDEA AS TO HOW TO CONVERT ANY OTHER OF THE CLISTS IF YOU NEED
00271005TO.  THIS PACKAGE OF CLISTS SHOULD NOW BE USEFUL TO A WIDER
00273005AUDIENCE, SINCE ALL THE NECESSARY MATERIALS ARE CONTAINED IN ONE
00274005SOURCE, NAMELY, ON THE CBT TAPE.
