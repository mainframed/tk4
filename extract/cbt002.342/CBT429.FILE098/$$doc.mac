                     XMIT/RECEIVE FOR TSO/E
0     This TSO/E ISPF modification was done to make the TSO/E function
      of XMIT/RECEIVE more user friendly.  A series of panels and help
      screens allow the user to send file and or messages to other
      TSO/E users localy or across NJE to another system.  The primary
      advantage with this method is that if a user wishes to send only
      a few members of a PDS somewhere, the clists invoke the LIBRARY
      services to present a list of library membres that may be selected
      individualy.  It is not the best of methods to use but for the
      limitted number of users we have it works quite well.  Note that
      we use RACF on all of our network systems so a user id that is
      limited has been defined on those systems and is used by the
      clists to build a batch job that is sent after the files/message
      to notify the receiver that a file has been sent to them.  If
      nothing else it shows the use of table and library functions for
      ISPF in a clist.
0     Have fun with it.  If you come up with a better way to use this
      let me know.

0     Unload files 2, 3 and 4 to dasd and then allocate them in as TSO
      proc.  After signing on with that proc go to main menu option
      6 (TSO COMMANDS) and enter $$$$DOC1 for additional install and
      usage information.  After you make whatever modifications are
      needed to the panels and skeletons for your shop and have down-
      loaded file 5 to disk (modify with information for your location)
      make the following change to panel ISR@PRIM to invoke the new
      function;
