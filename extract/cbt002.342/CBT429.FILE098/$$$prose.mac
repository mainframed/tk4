//*******************************************************************
//*    THIS FILE WAS CREATED USING THE YALE
//*    OFFLOAD PROGRAM (FILE 225). WHEN THE  OFFLOAD PROGRAM FINDS  *
//*    DATA RECORDS IN A PDS THAT LOOK LIKE IEBUPDTE CONTROL CARDS  *
//*    ( IE . './' ) IT SUBSTITUES A >< FOR AN ' ./ ' .             *
//*                                                                 *

//*                CONTROL CARDS HAVE BEEN CONVERTED TO ' >< '      *
//*                AND YOU WILL HAVE TO ISSUE A GLOBAL CHANGE TO    *
//*                CONVERT >< TO ./ BEFORE YOU USE THESE MEMBER AS  *
//*                SYSIN INPUT TO IEBUPDTE .                        *

//*   *** FIRST TAKE THE WHOLE FILE AND IEBUPDTE IT TO A DATASET    *
//*       THEN EDIT EACH OF THE FOLLOWING MEMBERS AND DO YOUR       *
//*       GLOBAL CHANGE BEFORE YOU DO ANOTHER IEBUPDTE RUN FOR      *
