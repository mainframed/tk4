I found this looking for something for Bruce Hewson I had filed
it in my cool bits folder.  It would make a good additon to File
322.

I have a REXX program (see below) that can be used without having
to create/call an assembler program.  The catch is that your
OS/390 system must have UNIX Systems Services installed.  This
allows me to call the UNIX sleep function from my REXX program.

For more details, see this IBM manual:
