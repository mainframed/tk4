        Documentation for this package can be found in member
        $$$DOC in this file.  That is an article concerning the
        new POINTER facility in COBOL II which allows access to
        control blocks on the MVS system through the COBOL II
        language.  Maps for a good number of MVS control blocks
        have been made in COBOL by the author, and these have
        been contributed to this file on the CBT tape for the
        convenience of anyone trying to use the new facility.

        The member MVS@JCL is a special member in that it contains
        JCL to assemble the supplied DSECTs using Assembler
        language.  This is for the purpose of revising the COBOL
        maps, just in case IBM decides to change them.
