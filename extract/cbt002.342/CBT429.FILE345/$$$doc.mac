     Since we've gone to GRS, in place of MIM, there was one
     feature of MIM that was sorely missed.  MIM would explain
     the nature of dataset contentions in greater detail than the
     initial messages from GRS.  True, you could get the detail
     by issuing the "D GRS,C" command, if you managed to catch it
     quick enough.  We deemed that this was insufficient.
     Attached are the solutions developed here.  One is a started
     task that checks for a contention situation each minute and
     displays information about it.  The other is a MPF exit that
     displays the same information whenever a dataset contention
     situation is announced vie the IEF099I message.

     These are very simple routines, without a lot of bells and
     whistles.  But they work!  They might not tell us how many
     minutes a job has been waiting for datasets, but at least
     we'll know it's still waiting.

     Your suggestions and comments are welcome....
