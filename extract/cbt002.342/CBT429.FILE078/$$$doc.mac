 Short doc.
     I have repackaged the EDITMAC.ZIP file from the SHARE 81
 diskettes' ISPF subdirectory.  Also included is the EDITALL.ZIP
 file.  I have to make a few remarks concerning their upload to
 the mainframe.

     Under DOS files, the three-character suffix was the indicator
 of the type of member we had:  e.g. PAN for panels, REX for REXX,
 CLI for clists, etc.  Upon upload to a partitioned dataset under
 MVS, I organized these into IEBUPDTE (or PDSLOAD - see files 035
 and 093) format unloaded pds'es.  In other words, in this file
 there is a member called REXX.  This should be loaded into a pds
 full of REXX execs.  The member called CLISTS should be loaded into
 a CLIST library.  PANELS should be loaded into a panel library.
 MESSAGES should be loaded into a message library.  SKELETNS should
 be loaded into a skeleton library.  If you use the PDSLOAD program
 instead of IEBUPDTE, you'll get ISPF statistics for all the members.

     For your convenience, I have provided sample jobs, #EBUPDTE and
#PDSLOAD to load a pds from the IEBUPDTE-format sequential members.
PDSLOAD is the preferred method.  You can find its load module on
file 035 of this tape, and its source on file 093.  PDSLOAD changes
the >< strings to ./ before reloading, and it re-stows ISPF statistics.

     Because of my emulation software, I had to globally change x'53'
 to x'5F' wherever it occured, and wherever it made sense.  I hope I
 was right.

     The member called MVS is a BASIC program that is meant to be run
 on a PC, so it will have to be downloaded again.  Some of the lines
 are longer than the lrecl of 80 on this pds, and they have been folded
 after column 80.  Of course, do not renumber this member.  You will be
 able to recognize, probably, which lines have been folded and how that
 was done.  You'll have to set it back again.

     The EDITALL macro comes from Lionel Dyck.  All the other material
 comes from John Kalinich.
