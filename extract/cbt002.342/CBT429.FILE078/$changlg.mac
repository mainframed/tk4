DATE      DESCRIPTION OF CHANGE

**-**-**  Miscellaneous fixes.  Check the file dates to see what has
          changed or run a compare against your last version of the SHAR
          Software Exchange diskettes (CD-ROM).

07-16-98  Update to DVOL clist dialog to display 4digit UCB addresses an
          large track capacity device (3390 mod 9) information from the
          new version of the DVOL command (CBT MVS tape, File 296).

05-08-97  PDSFTP - REXX dialog to automate PDS member file transfers.
          If a local PDS is entered on the pop-up, a member list will be
          displayed for you to select the members to be batch transferre
          This was developed for source file transfers from MVS to a PC.
          If a local DSN is not entered, then FTP will be invoked in it'
          normal interactive mode.  All pop-up fields are VPUT to the pr
          which makes for a no-brainer on return trips to the pop-up.

05-08-97  IDCAMS edit macro - Execute IDCAMS commands in edit.  This is
          the 'exec' function in 3.2.V(sam).  If you want to save your
          generated commands from 3.2.V, you can use this edit macro to
          execute them later.

02-25-97  CLONEID - REXX exec to "decompile" a logonid record into INSER
          format for cloning purposes.  Useful when you want to clone ne
          STC lids and wish to copy field values (e.g., NAME and PHONE)
          are not copied via INSERT USING(...).  Use in conjunction with
          RUNACF edit macro when editing the clone VIO dataset.

02-07-97  LIBDIR - REXX exec to display a CA-Librarian index list.  Outp
          in same format as PDSDIR.

01-16-97  PROFSET edit macro - Mass change all edit profiles for an ISPF
          application.  For example, you like to live dangerously and wa
          RECOVERY OFF NOWARN set permanently for all qualifiers in appl
          edit profiles (in addition to ISR, like IOF/ISF which get used
          you nest EDIT and VIEW).  Just create a short edit macro with
          commands to set profile values, and enter "PROFSET shortmac" w
          editing in the application.  ZDEFAULT profile is not affected.

09-20-96  ACFCOMP edit macro - Compile the rule that is in edit and issu
          "F ACF2,RELOAD(rule)" operator command if editing a resident a
          rule or "F ACF2,REBUILD(directory)" operator command if editin
          resource rule and the directory is resident.

          TESTACF edit macro - Test ACF2 rules based on DSN= values in J
          Using IOF, submit a job with TYPRUN=SCAN and then select your
          sysout.  Enter EDIT when browsing the JCL then invoke TESTACF
          to test a chunk of JCL (pronounced JAY-CIL).  The symbolics ha
          already been resolved and TESTACF ignores &variables in the DS
          parameter.  If you have SDSF, submit a job with TYPRUN=SCAN an
          invoke ISPF Edit with the "SE" action character on the JCL bef
          invoking TESTACF.

04-08-96  ACFTRAP edit macro - Queue ACF subcommands and trap the output
          of the ACF command processor in =NOTE= or data lines.

          RUNACF edit macro - Issue ACF subcommands currently being edit
          This macro works good when LIKE(...) masking can not provide t
          proper grouping for mass changes or you want to keep a set of
          "canned" ACF subcommands around for those changes that you wou
          normally have to go to the book for to remember.  Also provide
          an audit trail if you return the output as data lines.  If the
          command has to prompt the terminal (e.g., ACF67046 MULTIPLE
          RECORDS MAY BE DELETED - ENTER Y TO DELETE OR N TO CANCEL) for
          more information, RUNACF will go into a loop and you will have
          to attention (PA1) interrupt in order to halt execution.

03-21-96  ASA2PC edit macro - Convert ASA printer control characters to
          ASCII control characters.  This is handy to run just before
          downloading a print file (via FTP "ascii" mode) for inclusion
          a word processing document.  Page breaks and line spacing are
          maintained.

02-01-96  Update to EOL edit macro.  This version backtabs 10 characters
          at time looking for non blanks, then goes into the backspace 1
          in order to find the true End-Of-Line.  Loop time is reduced.

11-21-95  GETxxxx - More REXX sub-functions to 1) get ACF2 release id,
          2) get ACF2 userid string, 3) get connect group name, and
          4) get user name.

07-14-95  LOGLIST - Clist dialog to specify print delivery instructions
          for the ISPF list and log SYSOUT datasets.  This is a two step
          process.  First, a temporary exec named @LOGLIST is created in
          ISPFILE dataset.  The exec defines a dynamic output descriptor
          LOGLIST which is used on the OUTDES parameter of ALLOCATE for
          and ISPLOG.  Second, code must be inserted into a TSO start-up
          to test for the presence of @LOGLIST and execute the exec.

06-07-95  Update to SYSLOG clist dialog.  This version allows you to dis
          the archived IOF SLAM memos by day of week (MON-SUN), or "ALL"
          all SLAM memos on the JES2 spool.  The ISPF SYSLOG command can
          invoked with a day of week parameter, such as "SYSLOG SUN" to
          the normal panel prompt.

05-12-95  Update to ISPF panel TRIJOBS to pass the IOF jump.  For exampl
          the ISPF JOBS command "JOBS C.2.1" can be used to jump into th
          JOB LOG of the 2nd CICS job.

12-13-94  Update to BROWSE4 edit macro in support of ISPF 4.1 View.
          BROWSE4 (formerly known as BROWSE) had to be renamed because
          BROWSE is now a valid command when in Edit.  Also, the ZVIEW
          variable is examined to determine which browser to invoke
          (i.e., Browse or View).  You may want to create 2 separate mac
          (e.g., VIEW4 and BROWSE4) instead of using ZVIEW to pick the
          browser.

          Update to SYSLOG and EB dialogs in support of ISPF 4.1 View.
          Browse is faster to invoke than View, but edit macros (such as
          FX) and the HILITE command (with Highlight FIND strings on) ca
          be used in view mode.

10-31-94  PDSDIR - REXX exec to deblock a PDS directory without using TS
          or ISPF commands.  Useful if you need to grab the PDS member n
          and do something with it.

10-26-94  Update to SYSLOG clist dialog.  This version allows you to dis
          the "active" SYSLOG with either SDSF or IOF.  IOF is handy if
          need to use the FIND ALL command.

10-05-94  Update to FX edit macro.  Now other FIND parameters such as WO
          SUFFIX, PREFIX, and a label-range can be entered.  Examples:

                FX 'FIX' 1 40 SUFFIX .A .B
                FX 'SUF' 1 40 PREFIX .A .B
                FX 'THE' WORD
                FX 'THE' .ZFIRST .ZLAST

07-05-94  Update to EOL edit macro.  By pressing the EOL PF key repeated
          you can jump to end of line (EOL) on successive lines.  The ju
          action now works across eXcluded line blocks thanks to a modif
          by David McRitchie from Hoeschst Celanese Corp.

05-18-94  WEAVE edit macro - Interlace data from CUT table into a range
          lines.  This is useful when you are building control cards
          (e.g., IDCAMS) from a list of saved information (e.g., TSOTRAP
          PDS Output Log) and you need continuation cards or other comma
          after every line.

03-16-94  Update to RUN macro.  Now you can mark a section of commands w
          the Cn/CC line commands if you just want to EXECute a portion
          a clist or REXX exec.  An attempt is made to recognize which t
          of command procedure you are editing in order to pass the righ
          operand (CLIST/EXEC) on the TSO EXEC command.

01-21-94  RESETID - REXX exec to reduce the ACF2 password violation coun
          by one.  A check is made for TSO OPERator authority before pas
          the MODIFY command to SDSF.  Handy for SYSPROGs (with TSO and
          operator command authority) to help out their fellow users whe
          ADP security officer is out-of-pocket.

01-12-94  Update to JC and JCI edit macros.  A JCLLIB is now generated
          instead of a PROCLIB statement.  Also, a default OUTPUT JCL
          statement is generated from information in the "scroll-able"
          portion of the panel.

12-28-93  Addition of DOS batch files, UPLOAD and IEBUPDTE.  Used to com
          the ISPF PANELS, SKELETONS, MESSAGES, CLISTS, and REXX EXECS,
          IEBUPDTE sysin files with ./ ADD NAME= header cards in front o
          each member.  Kind of like the mainframe program OFFLOAD does
          a PDS.  The only glitch here is that the DOS file extension is
          of the name.  No problem, blow it away with the ISPF editor be
          the JCL (pronounced JAY-CIL) wrap and submit.  Takes the pain
          uploading 70+ files and then trying to copy them into PDS's.

11-23-93  Update to PLUG edit macro.  PLUG now supports label pairs or t
          On/OO line commands to define a range of lines.  Labels are us
          when making multiple plugs to a block of code.  All system and
          labels can be used.

08-05-93  Update to EOL edit macro.  By pressing the EOL PF key repeated
          you can jump to end of line (EOL) on successive lines.  The
          macro checks to see if the cursor is already at EOL (most like
          from the previous EOL PF key action).  If it is, then it jumps
          EOL on next line.  The jumping action does not work across
          eXcluded line blocks greater than 1 line.

07-16-93  EOL edit macro - Set cursor at end of current screen line.
          This works like most PC editors do when you press the "End"
          scroll key.  Handy when "adding-on" to JCL or text.  At the
          last SHARE, someone asked if there was a way to do this and
          the answer was no.  Assign EOL to a PF key to make this work.
          I personally use the easy-to-find but seldomly-used PF1 for
          this assignment.

06-23-93  Update to EB clist dialog.  This version invokes Librarian ELI
          EDIT and BROWSE instead of the older LIBEDIT and LIBROWSE.  If
          member name is a wildcard pattern or null, then an ELIPS LIST
          command is generated.

06-14-93  Update to BROWSE edit macro.  If the member to be browsed does
          not exist, then it is assumed to be a 2nd level DSN qualifier.

05-21-93  FX and PLUG edit macros - REXX versions for SPF/PC Version 3.0

05-11-93  Removal of COLS edit macro.  I found out that :COLS in a PF ke
          definition is all you have to specify.  The cursor stays put a
          you get the columns line above the cursor.

03-24-93  GETxxxxx - REXX sub-functions to extract various items out of
          control blocks for subsequent display on an action bar panel (
          INFO.ABC for examples).  This code was derived from Joe Millar
          Paul Waterhouse's Rexx examples on the NaSCOM bulletin board a
          the SHOW.ZIP file on the SHARE Software Exchange from Rockwell
          International.  SHOW extracts more information from control bl
          and is written in assembler.

02-24-93  Converted the SORTWORK dialog from clist to REXX.  Solved some
          arithmetic overflow problems and used SyncSort Release 3.2
          intermediate disk space formula.

 1-08-93  EB - Clist dialog to invoke either ISPF EDIT/BROWSE, Librarian
          Edit/Browse, or the PDS command (PDS, CBT File 182) on a
          menu of 19 datasets.  Invoked with the ISPF EBrowse command.

12-29-92  DVOL - Clist dialog that front-ends the DVOL command (located
          CBT mods tape, File 296) to display DASD free space stats in a
          ISPF table.  Invoked with the ISPF SPACE command.  When using
          SHORT display option, you can SORT table by volser or total fr
          tracks.  Primary sort key is always device type.

12-18-92  COMPUTE - REXX dialog to calculate Rexx arithmetic expressions
          Invoked with ISPF CALC command.  Uses a pop-up window to promp
          if no expression is given with command.  A TSO Times (tm) $250
          contest winner.

12-18-29  MVS basica program - Pseudo-display of the ISPF Primary Option
          Use PF3 to exit.  Easy to customize to your own primary menu d
          with the help of any BASIC manual.  Useful when fielding those
          winded telephone calls or when you are taking a trip down the
          and don't want to (or can't) keep pressing the Enter key to st
          logged on.  Writes a CR to the COM1 (9600 baud) port every 15
          or so.  Invoke from your communications program break or shell
          If security is a problem with this, then don't use it or restr
          to the all-knowing and all-powerful SYSPROG populus.

12-14-92  UNX edit macro - Show the first n line(s) from each X-cluded b
          Comes in handy as a companion macro to 'FX' and 'FXC' to see
          continuation lines.

11-30-92  Update to COLS edit macro to restore the cursor position to
          where is was before the PF key (cols;:cols;cols setcsrp) was
          pressed.

11-23-92  Add ISPF panel TRIJOBS to display "key" jobs with either IOF
          or SDSF.  Invoked with ISPF JOBS command.  Easily modified
          to your local naming conventions.

11-05-92  BROWSE edit macro - Another version of browse while in edit.
          This one can be invoked 3 different ways and supports member
          name patterns.

11-03-92  Add ISPF tutorial panel TRIMACS which can be invoked by the
          ISPF command MACROS for edit macro help.

10-06-92  Update to DSK33XX clist to calculate total volumes based on
          double density 3380 and 3390 models.

 9-09-92  PLUG edit macro - Plug data into edit buffer at a given column
          This is handy when you have a need to plug a prefix (e.g., a
          command) or suffix (e.g., a terminator) on a number of data li
          Before PLUG this usually involved inserting a temporary data
          line and then using the M(ove) and O(verlay) line commands.
          PLUG works similar to the Rexx OVERLAY function in that it
          replaces characters regardless of the their value.

 9-09-92  Removal of CONT edit macro.  Use "PLUG X 72" instead.

 6-26-92  TRAPCMD - REXX dialog to trap TSO/REXX command line output and
          display in an ISPF table.  Especially useful to invoke REXX co
          that produces mucho output with the non-scrollable SAY verb.
          Output display is limited to 80 bytes.

 5-19-92  Add OTHER PARAMETERS fields to Job Card Macro panel in order
          to allow users to enter whatever additional JOB card parameter
          they need which are not defined in the panel.  Code as you
          would on the JOB statement (trailing commas will be plugged in
          if missing).

 4-30-92  FXC edit macro - FIND ALL after EXCLUDE ALL on the word at the
          cursor position.  Put in a PF key for one-key operation.

 4-29-92  Update to FX edit macro to accept picture, hex, character, and
          text strings as arguments.  Also, &variables as arguments need
          only 1 ampersand coded instead of 2.

 3-23-92  COLS edit macro - Display columns line above cursor position.
          Have to put in PF key (cols;:cols) to make work.

 2-12-92  Add PERCENT USED PER TRACK field to disk space calculation
          panel.  Updated panel edits on block size and key length.

11-01-91  MEMLIST edit macro - Display member list in =MSG> and =NOTE=
          lines.

 9-23-91  Update to SUPERC clist to strip off (*) from OTHER DSNAME fiel
          value if entered on panel.
