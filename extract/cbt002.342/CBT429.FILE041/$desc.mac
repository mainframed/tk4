..SEC * JES2 EXITS FOR XEROX FORMS CONTROL



    ABSTRACT:         BENJ. FRANKLIN HAS DEVELOPED EXITS TO MVS/SP JES2

                      TO PROVIDE TABLE DRIVEN FORMS CONTROL FOR XEROX

                      8700/9700 LASER PRINTERS.  THE EXITS INSERT XEROX

                      DJDE COMMANDS BETWEEN REPORTS GOING TO THE

                      PRINTERS BASED ON THE SYSOUT CLASS AND FORMS ID

                      SPECIFIED IN STANDARD JCL.

 WE INTEND TO MAKE THE XEROX FORMS CONTROL JES2 EXITS WE'VE DEVELOPED

 AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC DOMAIN ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, PROBABLY THROUGH

 SHARE (EITHER THE JES2 MODS TAPE, OR THE CBT MODS TAPE).  WE MAY ALSO

 SUPPLY COPIES OF THE EXITS TO INTERESTED SHOPS DIRECTLY.  WE MAKE NO

 WARRANTY OR GUARANTEE THAT THE EXITS WILL FUNCTION CORRECTLY IN YOUR

 ENVIRONMENT, NOR CAN WE BE HELD LIABLE FOR ANY ERRORS OR LOSSES

 RESULTING FROM THEIR IMPLEMENTATION AND/OR USAGE.



 WHILE YOU USE THESE EXITS AT YOUR OWN RISK AND MUST SUPPORT THEM BY

 YOURSELF, I WILL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER A REASONABLE NUMBER OF QUESTIONS

 BY PHONE CONCERNING THEIR INSTALLATION.  I ALSO WELCOME COMMENTS AND

 SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTS.

    JUSTIFICATION:    WE DECIDED TO REPLACE OUR IBM 1403 IMPACT PRINTERS

                      WITH A XEROX 8700 LASER PRINTER.  A REQUIREMENT

                      WAS THAT WE IMPLEMENT THE PRINTING OF DUPLEX ON

                      WHITE 3-HOLE PAPER AS OUR DEFAULT IN AS SHORT A

                      TIME AS POSSIBLE.  THE JES2 USER EXIT APPROACH

                      APPEARED TO BE THE FASTEST SOLUTION.



    BENEFITS DERIVED FROM USING JES2 USER EXITS:

                      1) REDUCES OPERATOR INTERVENTION FOR FORM SETUPS.

                      2) JES2 SUPPORT FOR DUPLEX PRINTING.

                      3) SIMPLIFIES FORMS SPECIFICATION THRU JCL.

                         IE:  //DDNAME  DD  SYSOUT=(C,,FORM)

                      4) STANDARDIZES AND CENTRALIZES FORMS CONTROL.

                      5) PROVIDES OUTPUT DESTINATION FLEXABILITY.

                      6) RECOVERY FROM PRINT INTERRUPTIONS.

                      7) EASE OF IMPLEMENTATION AND TESTING.




    HISTORY:          A) ORIGINALLY DEVELOPED AT GREAT AMERICAN

                         INSURANCE COMPANY IN CINCINNATI, OHIO AS A SET

                         OF DIRECT USER MODIFICATIONS TO JES2.


                      B) LATER REWRITTEN BY NARM TCHUN OF GATX

                         CORPORATION IN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS AS AN MVS/SP

                         JES2 1.3.2 USER EXIT (EXIT 1).  GATX MADE IT

                         PUBLIC DOMAIN BY PLACING IT ON THE SHARE JES2

                         USER MODS TAPE.


                      C) FINALLY, ENHANCED BY MIKE SHEEDY OF BENJ.

                         FRANKLIN SAVINGS AND LOAN FOR OPERATION ON

                         MVS/SP JES2 1.3.6 WITH THE ADDITION OF SUPPORT

                         FOR DUPLEX AND SUPPRESSION OF JES2 FORMS SETUP

                         MESSAGES.  THIS FINAL VERSION USES JES2 USER

                         EXITS 1, 5, 15, AND 250 (USER DEFINED).

..SEC *.* JES2 USER EXITS AND MODULES



 THE JES2 USER EXITS WHICH MAKE UP OUR XEROX FORMS CONTROL SYSTEM ARE

 ASSEMBLED AND LINKED TOGETHER INTO ONE MODULE CALLED EXIT1MIT.  THIS

 MODULE IS LOADED BY JES2 WHEN IT COMES UP.  THE FOLLOWING IS A

 DESCRIPTION OF THE MODULES WHICH MAKE UP EXIT1MIT:




 EXIT1MIT - JES2 MODULE INFORMATION TABLE FOR THE EXITS INVOLVED IN OUR

            XEROX FORMS CONTROL SYSTEM.  MERGES ALL OF THE EXITS INTO

            ONE LOAD MODULE.



 EXIT1REG - REGISTER DEFINITIONS AND OTHER SYMBOLICS USED IN THE EXITS.



 EXIT1A   - JES2 EXIT 1 PRINT SEPARATOR EXIT DEVELOPED TO PROVIDE XEROX

            FORMS CONTROL BY INSERTING DJDE COMMANDS IN FRONT OF THE

            PRINT SEPARATOR PAGES.  USES SYSOUT CLASS AND FORM ID TO

            REFERENCE TABLES CONTAINED IN EXIT1TAB.  SEPDS=Y IDENTIFIES

            A PRINTER AS A XEROX 8700/9700.



 EXIT1TAB - VARIOUS TABLES USED BY THE EXITS, PRINCIPALLY EXIT1A, TO

            DEFINE AND MANAGE XEROX FORMS CONTROL.



 EXIT1B   - ORIGINAL JES2 EXIT 1 BF PRINT SEPARATOR EXIT MODIFIED TO

            PRODUCE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SEPARATOR PAGES FOR XEROX

            DESTINED OUTPUT DEPENDING ON ORIENTATION

            (LANDSCAPE/PORTRAIT) AND PAGE SIZE.  JDE AT XEROX EXTRACTS

            DATA FROM GENERATED SEPARATOR PAGES FOR DETERMINING JOB

            BOUNDARIES AND STATUS DISPLAYS.
..PAGE



 EXIT5    - JES2 EXIT 5 COMMAND PREPROCESSOR EXIT USED TO FORCE FORM

            SETUP MESSAGES ON THE XEROX CONSOLE WHENEVER THE XEROX

            PRINTER IS STOPED OR HALTED AND RESTARTED FROM JES2.

            IMPLEMENTED TO AVOID USING WRONG STOCK OR DUPLEX/SIMPLEX

            ORIENTATION AFTER XEROX MAINTENANCE.



 EXIT15   - JES2 EXIT 15 OUTPUT DATASET/COPY SELECT SEPARATOR EXIT USED

            TO PROVIDE DUPLEX AND MULTIPLE LOGICAL PAGE PER PHYSICAL

            PAGE SUPPORT BY INSERTING A SKIP TO NEW FRONT DJDE COMMAND

            BETWEEN SEPARATE DATASETS AND COPIES OF DATASETS WITHIN THE

            SAME SYSOUT JOB.



 EXIT250  - JES2 USER EXIT USED TO SUPPRESS JES2 FORMS SETUP MESSAGES

            WHENEVER A FORMS CHANGE OCCURS FOR A XEROX PRINTER.  EXIT1A

            CREATES FORMS SETUP MESSAGES THRU DJDE'S WHICH DISPLAY ON

            THE XEROX CONSOLE WHEN THE OUTPUT PRINTS.  EXIT250 REQUIRES

            THAT USERMOD ZZ03821 BE APPLIED TO HASPPRPU IN ORDER TO

            DEFINE ITS CALL.

..SEC *.* TABLES IN EXIT1TAB


    EXIT1TAB:    XEROX 8700/9700 FORMS CONTROL TABLES


    FUNCTIONS:   TO PROVIDE JES2 EXIT1A, EXIT1B, EXIT5, EXIT15 AND

                 EXIT250 WITH THE INTERNAL REFERENCE DATA TO CONTROL

                 ONE OR MORE XEROX 8700/9700 PRINTERS.


    DESCRIPTION: THESE TABLES ARE AN ADOPTION OF THE FORMS CROSS

                 REFERENCE TABLES WHICH WERE DESIGNED BY THE GREAT

                 AMERICAN INSURANCE COMPANY, CINCINNATI, OHIO.

                 THE TABLES CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING SEVEN ENTRY

                 GROUPS:



    .  PRNTRTAB  PRINTER TABLE ENTRY            (12 BYTES).


                 EACH ENTRY NAMES A JES2 PRINTER AND SPECIFIES ITS

                 TYPE.  FIELDS ARE USED TO CONTAIN DATA NEEDED BY

                 THE JES2 EXITS DURRING THEIR OPERATION.



    .  SCTE   :  SYSOUT CLASS TABLE ENTRY       (8 BYTES).


                 EACH ENTRY NAMES A SYSOUT CLASS, SPECIFIES WHICH

                 JES2 PRINTER IT SHOULD PRINT ON, AND WHICH FORMS

                 CROSS REFERENCE TABLE TO USE.



    .  FCRTE  :  FORMS CROSS REFERENCE TABLE ENTRY (16 BYTES).


                 EACH ENTRY CONTAINS A FORM NAME, THE ADDRESS OF THE

                 DJDE FORMS IMAGE TABLE ENTRY (DFITE), THE ADDRESS OF

                 ITS DJDE VFU IMAGE TABLE ENTRY (DVITE), A MODE BYTE,

                 AND A PAPER STOCK NUMBER.

                      NOTE THAT THERE ARE ACTUALLY TWO TABLES:

                 FFRMTABF IS FOR SYSOUT CLASS 'F' (OPERATOR SETUP).

                 XFRMTABX IS FOR SYSOUT CLASSES OTHER THAN 'F'

                      (NO OPERATOR SETUP - STD 3-HOLE DUPLEX).
..PAGE



    .  DFITE  :  DJDE FORMS IMAGE TABLE ENTRY   (80 BYTES).


                 EACH ENTRY CONTAINS A FORM(S), FORMAT, DATA

                 LENGTH, OR SHIFT REQUIREMENT.



    .  DVITE  :  DJDE VFU IMAGE TABLE ENTRY     (80 BYTES).


                 EACH ENTRY CONTAINS A VFU IMAGE, PRECEDED BY

                 A HALF WORD WHICH COUNTS THE NUMBER OF LINES

                 IN THE ENTRY.



    .  PTMTE  :  PAPER TRAY MESSAGE TABLE ENTRY (80 BYTES).


                 EACH ENTRY CONTAINS A MESSAGE TEXT TO BE SHOWN

                 ON THE 8700/9700 CONSOLE TELLING THE OPERATOR

                 WHAT PAPER STOCK TO LOAD INTO THE PRINTER.



    .  PSMTE  :  PAGE SETUP MESSAGE TABLE ENTRY (80 BYTES).


                 SOME ENTRIES CONTAIN MESSAGE TEXT TO BE SHOWN

                 ON THE 8700/9700 CONSOLE TELLING THE OPERATOR

                 ABOUT THE JOB THAT IS PROCESSED.  THESE ENTRIES

                 HELP OPERATOR KEEP TRACK OF THE JOBS THAT ARE

                 PURGED OFF JES2, AND ALSO PROCESSED BY THE

                 8700/9700 PRINTER.  OTHER ENTRIES SET THE PRINTER

                 FOR DUPLEX OR SIMPLEX OPERATION, OR PERFORM OTHER

                 PRINTER SETUP FUNCTIONS.

..SEC *.* EXIT INSTALLATION GUIDELINES

 THE FOLLOWING GUIDELINES WILL BE USEFUL TO THOSE INTERESTED IN
 INSTALLING OUR JES2 EXITS FOR XEROX FORMS CONTROL.


 1) READ THIS DOCUMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY BEFORE ATTEMPTING THE
    INSTALLATION.  NOTE OUR DISCLAMER REGARDING THE CONDITIONS
    UNDERWHICH WE MAKE THESE EXITS AVAILABLE.


 2) LOAD THE MODULES, JCL, AND DOCUMENTATION WHICH MAKE UP THE EXIT
    INSTALLATION INTO A PDS.  IF THE EXITS ARE COMING FROM A SHARE MODS
    TAPE, FOLLOW THE MODS TAPE INSTRUCTIONS FOR LOADING THE EXIT FILE
    TO DISK (YOU'VE PROBABLY ALREADY DONE THIS SO YOU COULD READ THIS
    DOCUMENT).

    IF YOU HAVE RECEIVED THE EXITS ON TAPE DIRECTLY FROM US, USE THE
    FOLLOWING SAMPLE JCL TO LOAD THE EXIT FILE TO DISK.  THERE WILL BE
    ONLY ONE FILE ON THE LABELLED TAPE WE SUPPLY, A PDS IN MVS IEBCOPY
    UNLOADED FORMAT.  CHANGE THE JCL TO SUIT YOUR SHOP'S REQUIREMENTS:

    //JOBNAME  JOB (ACCOUNT),'NAME',CLASS=A,MSGCLASS=A  <------
    //IEBCOPY  EXEC PGM=IEBCOPY
    //SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
    //SYSUDUMP DD  SYSOUT=*
    //SYSUT3   DD  UNIT=WORK,SPACE=(CYL,(1,1))       <------
    //SYSUT4   DD  UNIT=WORK,SPACE=(CYL,(1,1))       <------
    //TAPE     DD  DSN=BKUP.SYS2.JES2136.EXITSRC,
    //             DISP=OLD,
    //             UNIT=TAPE,                        <------
    //             VOL=SER=JES2EX,
    //             LABEL=(1,SL,EXPDT=98000)
    //DISK     DD  DSN=SYS2.JES2136.EXITSRC,         <------
    //             DISP=(NEW,CATLG,DELETE),
    //             UNIT=SYSALLDA,                    <------
    //             VOL=SER=??????,                   <------
    //             SPACE=(3120,(390,,10),,,ROUND),
    //             DCB=(DSORG=PO,RECFM=FB,BLKSIZE=3120,LRECL=80)
    //SYSIN    DD  *
    EXITFILE COPY  OUTDD=DISK,INDD=TAPE
    /*


 3) REVIEW THE MEMBERS OF SYS2.JES2136.EXITSRC THOROUGHLY.  GAIN AN
    UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE EXITS WORK.  IT WILL BE UP TO YOU TO
    SUPPORT THEM.


 4) DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF IMPLEMENTING THE JES2 EXITS:

    A) DO YOU USE ANY OF THE FOLLOWING JES2 EXITS CURRENTLY:
       1, 5, 15, OR 250?  IF SO, YOU MAY NEED TO REWORK OR COMBINE
       YOUR EXITS WITH THE NEW ONES.  ON THE OTHERHAND, YOUR EXITS
       MAY COEXIST JUST FINE WITH THE NEW ONES.  SOME SPECIFIC POINTS:

       EXIT1A WAS CONSTRUCTED IN SUCH A WAY THAT EXISTING EXIT1'S CAN
       BE CONCATENATED BEHIND IT (AS EXIT1B IS).

       EXIT1B MIGHT BE REPLACED WITH YOUR EXISTING EXIT1 WITH
       MODIFICATIONS TO ALLOW THE XEROX PRINTER TO RECOGNIZE JOB
       BOUNDARIES.

       EXIT5 CAN BE SKIPPED IF NECESSARY, ALTHOUGH IT PROVIDES VALUABLE
       PROTECTION TO INSURE OUTPUT GETS PRINTED ON THE CORRECT PAPER
       STOCK AFTER PRINTER MAINTENANCE.


       EXIT15 CAN BE SKIPPED IF YOU DO LITTLE OR NO DUPLEX OR MULTIPLE
       LOGICAL PAGES PER PHYSICAL PAGE PRINTING.  IF YOU HAVE YOUR OWN
       EXIT15, THEN YOU USE SEPDS TO GET TO IT.  YOU'LL HAVE TO REWORK
       THE NEW EXITS TO NOT USE SEPDS AS THE MEANS FOR DETERMINING
       WHICH ARE THE XEROX PRINTERS (YOU COULD DEPEND SOLELY ON THE
       PRINTER TABLE IN EXIT1TAB).

       EXIT250 CAN BE SKIPPED IF YOU HAVE VERY FEW FORMS DEFINED, DON'T
       CARE IF THE OPERATORS HAVE TO RESPOND TO THE JES2 FORMS SETUP
       MESSAGES, SET YOUR PRINTER WORK SELECTION CRITERIA SO THAT THE
       OPERATORS CONTROL WHICH FORMS PRINT WHEN, OR HAVE SOME OTHER
       MEANS OF SUPPRESSING THE JES2 FORMS SETUP MESSAGES (SUCH AS TSSO
       OR SOME OTHER AUTOMATIC MVS CONSOLE MESSAGE TRAPPER/RESPONDER).
       THE USERMOD ZZ03821 WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO BE REWORKED DEPENDING
       ON YOUR MAINTENANCE LEVEL OF JES2.  MAKE SURE IT GETS INSERTED
       INTO HASPPRPU AT THE RIGHT PLACE.

    B) THE EXITS ASSUME THAT ONLY ONE JDE WILL EVER BE STARTED ON THE
       XEROX PRINTER (THE DEFAULT).  DJDE'S GENERATED BY THE EXITS
       HANDLE ALL FORMS CONTROL.  IF YOUR PRESENT SYSTEM IS TO HAVE
       THE OPERATORS START AND END JDE'S FOR INDIVIDUAL JOBS OR FORMS
       (PERHAPS VIA JES2 SYSOUT CLASSES, FORMS, SETUP MESSAGES) THEN
       IMPLEMENTING THIS NEW SYSTEM WILL BE QUITE A CHANGE (FOR THE
       BETTER, HOPEFULLY).  A WAY TO MIGRATE INTO IT WOULD BE TO USE
       SEPATATE SYSOUT CLASSES FOR JCL CONVERTED TO THE NEW SYSTEM
       AND CONTROL WHETHER THE PRINTER USES THE EXITS VIA THE SEPDS
       OPERAND.  SWITCH BACK AND FORTH ON A SET SCHEDULE.

    C) YOU MUST BUILD YOUR NEW FORMS TABLES IN EXIT1TAB TO REFLECT YOUR
       SHOP'S PRINT NEEDS.  YOU MUST BUILD DEFAULT AND GLOBAL JSE'S TO
       CORRESPOND TO THE DJDE'S DEFINED IN YOUR UPDATED EXIT1TAB.  I
       RECOMMEND USING AN ALTERNATE JES2 FOR TESTING YOUR CHANGES (SEE
       DOCUMENT).

    D) NOTE THAT OUR DJDE'S ARE RECOGNIZED BY THE JDE AS HAVING THE
       FORMAT "  DJDE ...;".  THERE ARE TWO SPACES IN FRONT OF THE
       CONSTANT "DJDE".  YOU MAY HAVE TO MODIFY THE DJDE DEFINITIONS
       IN THE TABLES, AND LOGIC IN EXIT1A WHICH MODIFIES THEM, TO
       CONFORM WITH THE DJDE'S YOUR PROGRAMS GENERATE.  ALSO EXIT15.

    E) NOTE THAT EXIT15 CANNOT INSURE THAT REPORTS PRINTING DUPLEX THAT
       ORIGINATE FROM THE SAME DD STATEMENT WILL ALWAYS HAVE THEIR
       FIRST PAGE PRINT ON THE FRONT SIDE OF A CUT SHEET.  SWITCHING
       FROM A SIMPLEX TO A DUPLEX ENVIRONMENT, YOU MAY HAVE TO DO AS WE
       DID AND DEFINE SPECIAL FORMS FOR WHICH THE JDE DETERMINES THE
       REPORT BREAKS.

    F) JES2 INITIALIZATION OUTDEF OPERANDS DMNDSET AND USERSET MUST BE
       SET EQUAL TO 'NO'.  IF YOU HAVE THEM SET TO 'YES' THEN SWITCHING
       THEM TO 'NO' WILL CAUSE YOUR PRINTOUT TO BE PRINTED BY FORM ID
       INSTEAD OF BY JOB.  THIS WILL MEAN LESS WORK FOR THE OPERATORS
       (FEWER FORMS CHANGES) AND POSSIBLY MORE WORK FOR DATA CONTROL
       (FINDING ALL OF THE DIFFERENT SYSOUTS OF A JOB).  MAKING THIS
       SWITCH DID NOT CAUSE OUR SHOP MUCH OF AN IMPACT.

    G) THE OPERATORS MUST RESPOND TO PAPER STOCK MESSAGES DISPLAYED ON
       THE XEROX CONSOLE.  ON THE OTHER HAND, THEY'LL NO LONGER HAVE TO
       RESOND TO JES2 FORMS SETUP MESSAGES FOR THE XEROX PRINTERS ON
       THE MVS CONSOLE (WITH EXIT250 IN PLACE).  THE NON-XEROX PRINTERS
       WILL CONTINUE TO PRESENT JES2 FORMS SETUP MESSAGES.

    H) THE JES2 EXITS WERE DEVELOPED AND IMPLEMENTED UNDER MVS/SP JES2
       RELEASE 1.3.4.  LATER THEY WERE MODIFIED TO RUN UNDER MVS/SP
       JES2 RELEASE 1.3.6.  THEY WILL PROBABLY NEED TO BE REWORKED IF
       YOU ARE ON A DIFFERENT RELEASE OR LEVEL OF JES2.  ANY JES2 OLDER
       OR NEWER THAN RELEASE 1.3.6 IS BOUND TO HAVE CHANGES TO THE JES2
       $ MACROS AND INITIALIZATION PARAMETERS.  EXIT1MIT CAN BE
       ESPECIALLY AFFECTED BY THIS.

    I) IF YOUR APPLICATION PROGRAMS GENERATE THEIR OWN DJDE'S, IT MAY
       BE NECESSARY TO SUPPRESS THE SKIP TO NEW FRONT DJDE GENERATED
       IN JES2 EXIT15 FOR DUPLEX.  OTHERWISE, THE APPLICATION GENETATED
       DJDE'S AT THE FRONT OF THE PRINTOUT MAY GET SKIPPED.  DO SO VIA
       THE MODE BIT ENTRIES IN THE FORMS TABLES.

    J) IF YOU USE A SPOOL ARCHIVER AND/OR REPORT DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM,
       SPECIAL PROVISIONS MAY BE NECESSARY TO PROVIDE XEROX FORMS
       CONTROL THRU THEM, ESPECIALLY THE DATASET SEPARATION FUNCTION
       PERFORMED BY JES2 EXIT15.  YOU MAY HAVE TO COPY LOGIC FROM
       EXIT1A AND/OR EXIT15 INTO YOUR SPECIAL SYSTEM.  BEWARE OF
       SOLUTIONS WHICH CAUSE EXCESSIVE OPERATOR INTERVENTION FOR FORMS
       SETUPS.


 5) INSTALL THE EXIT MODULES, USERMOD, AND JDE'S UNCHANGED INTO AN
    ALTERNATE JES2.  $ASM1 CONTAINS JCL TO ASSEMBLE THE EXITS, BUT IT
    MUST BE MODIFIED TO REMOVE SOME BENJ. FRANKLIN ONLY STEPS AT THE
    END.  ALSO SEE SECTION ON JES2 INITIALIZATION PARAMETER
    REQUIREMENTS.


 6) TEST THE EXITS TO VERIFY CORRECT INSTALLATION AND GAIN FAMILIARITY.
    A NON-XEROX PRINTER CAN BE USED TO DISPLAY THE DJDE'S GENERATED, OR
    USE A GTF CCW TRACE.


 7) MODIFY THE EXIT MODULES, USERMOD, AND JDE'S AS NEEDED TO SUPPORT
    YOUR REQUIREMENTS AND TEST VIA THE ALTERNATE JES2.


 8) PROVIDE OPERATOR AND USER DOCUMENTATION AND TRAINING.  SEE EXAMPLES
    IN THIS DOCUMENT.



 FOR THOSE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO IMPROVE THE XEROX FORMS CONTROL SYSTEM,
 THE BIGGEST IMPROVEMENT I CAN THINK OF WOULD BE TO MAKE THE FORMS
 CONTROL DEFINITIONS DYNAMIC, THUS AVOIDING THE NEED TO REASSEMBLE THE
 EXITS AND DO THE JES2 HOT START.

 ANOTHER IMPROVEMENT WOULD BE TO SPECIFY THE FORM DIMENSIONS IN THE
 FORMS CROSS REFERENCE TABLE (FCRTE) SO THAT THE BEGINNING BANNER PAGES
 CAN BE FORMATTED TO FIT THE FORM.  THIS CAN SOLVE PAGE OVERFLOW
 PROBLEMS WHICH MAY CAUSE THE JDE TO LOOSE TRACK OF THE BANNER PAGES.

..SEC *.* OPERATIONAL DOCUMENTATION

 THIS SECTION CONTAINS DOCUMENTATION FOR EXPLAINING THE NEW XEROX FORMS
 CONTROL SYSTEM TO YOUR OPERATIONS STAFF.  MODIFY TO SUIT YOUR
 REQUIREMENTS.

..SEC *.*.* XEROX FORMS CONTROL PHILOSOPHY
..SPACE
 We will use JES2 exits to manage the forms used by the XEROX laser
 printer.  JES2 exit 1 (Print/Punch Separator) gets control at the
 beginning of each sysout group (job) and will examine sysout class and
 form name specified in the SYSOUT operand.  It will use the sysout
 class and form name to select XEROX DJDE commands from a set of tables
 for insertion into the print stream going to the printer.  These DJDE
 commands will setup the printer for the type of form required.
 General and special forms will be included in the tables.  New forms
 types can be tested outside of this process and placed in the tables
 during periodic maintenance.  One time form needs and special printer
 control is not precluded by this technique.  An additional advantage
 is that forms control is maintained through print interruptions (such
 as $IPRTn, printer failures, and system crashes).

 Specifying forms for the XEROX printer is similar to other printers:

 Code JCL as follows:  //ddname   DD  SYSOUT=(x,,abcd)

 Where 'x' is the sysout class and 'abcd' represents XEROX forms
 control.

 General form types have been defined for which each character of the
 form name (abcd) has a meaning:



   For 'a':

        USR2          User forms control 2
        USR3          User forms control 3
        etc.


 If forms are not specified they default to our standard (STD.), which
 is equal to DLL8 (duplex, 3-hole paper, landscape, 1-up, narrow lines,
 8 lines per inch).  This should be the most commonly used form.


 With the insertion of a special user defined exit into JES2 (which
 we'll name exit 250) we eliminate JES2 form setup messages on the
 operator's MVS console.  Instead, forms setup messages will appear on
 the operator's XEROX console when actual changes must be made at the
 XEROX printer, such as for print mode (duplex or simplex) or paper
 stock (3 hole, no hole, or special form).  The operator makes the
 indicated forms change and responds to the message to continue.  We
 will make white 3-hole paper printing duplex be our standard for all
 sysout classes except 'F', and use sysout class 'F' for all operator
 setup forms.


 We will use JES2 exit 15 (Output data set / Copy select) to insert a
 XEROX DJDE command in front of each sysout dataset and copy to cause
 the XEROX printer to skip to the front of a new cut sheet when in
 duplex mode and/or printing multiple logical pages per physical page.
 This will help keep reports from beginning on the back or same side of
 the last page of the previous report.  For this to work, each report
 must be output on its own unique DD statement and multiple copies must
 be designated through JCL (such as COPIES=n on the DD statement).
 Those reports which follow one another on the same DD statement will
 require special attention to keep separate.  Some solutions are:

    1)  Print 1-up in simplex mode (example:  SYSOUT=(F,,SLL8) )

    2)  Use a special form which instructs the XEROX printer to scan
        the print stream for report breaks (example:  SYSOUT=(P,,ICL) ).
        This will be implemented in special forms AP, CPI, DEP, FA, and
        ICL.

    3)  Modify the application to separate the reports to separate DD
        statements (and use the COPIES operand on the DD statements).
..PAGE

    4)  Modify the application to insert DJDE commands between reports
        (and copies) to instruct the XEROX printer to skip to a new
        cut sheet.


 We will use JES2 exit 5 (JES2 command preprocessor) to reset the forms
 control in exit 1 to force a setup message on the next print output
 anytime the XEROX printer is stopped or halted from JES2.  This is to
 insure that the operator checks the paper setup after service is
 performed on the XEROX printer.


 Modifications will be made to the MVS POWER proc and program TEC021 to
 support printing reports transferred from the DOS system to MVS JES2
 printed on the XEROX 8700 in duplex mode and/or multiple logical pages
 per physical page.  A XEROX DJDE command will be inserted in front of
 each DOS report as needed to cause the XEROX printer to skip to the
 front of a new cut sheet.


 With modifications to SAR (Sysout Archival and Retrieval) user exit
 SARPRTUX, SAR will support the JES2 exit 1 and the user inserted exit
 descibed above, but not the JES2 exit 15.  We have been in contact
 with Essential Software discussing ways SAR could be modified to
 support the JES2 exit 15.  They have been receptive to doing this in a
 future release of SAR.  As we currently process very few, if any, user
 reports through SAR we can probably go on with our implementation
 plans and figure that the SAR support will not be required until
 later.
..PAGE
..SEC *.*.* XEROX FORMS DEFINED
..SPACE
 The following forms have been defined for the XEROX printer.  Sysout
 class 'F' is reserved for forms requiring operator setup.  All
 non-class 'F' sysout should print on 3-hole stock in duplex mode and
 not require operator setup.  All undefined forms default to the
 standard, which is DLL8.  If a form which should be specified with
 sysout class 'F' is specified with a class other than class 'F', it
 will be printed on 3-hole stock in duplex mode.  If no form is
 specified, DLL8 is assumed.

 Definitions:

   CLASS  - Sysout print class:  'non-F' is any class other than 'F'.
   FORM   - Sysout form id, as in SYSOUT=(x,,form).
   STOCK  - Paper stock (3-hole, no-hole, statements, etc.)
   MODE   - SIMPLEX prints on one side, DUPLEX prints on both sides.
   UP     - Logical pages per side (each skip to channel 1 is a logical
            page).
   ORIENT - Orientation:  LANDSCAPE runs across, PORTRAIT runs down.
   LINES  - Maximum lines per logical page.
   CHARS  - Maximum characters per line.
   LC     - Font capable of printing lower case characters (YES or NO).
   FLASH  - Forms flash:  LINES are narrow lines, BLANK is no flash,
            SHADED are shaded bars.


 Special forms NOW, REG, and QDEF are used to print deposit system
 account statements.  NOW is for NOW accounts, REG is for regular
 accounts, and QDEF is for quarter-end deferred comp accounts.  NOW and
 REG support AIMS machine bar codes in the upper right-hand corner,
 while QDEF does not.  Specify sysout class 'F' when using forms NOW,
 REG, and QDEF.


 Special forms AP, CPI, DEFC, FA, HEAD, and ICL invoke special
 processing in the XEROX printer to cause skips to new cut sheets at
 report breaks.  They are used on certain DD statements in their
 respective applications where multiple reports come out on the same DD
 statement.  Other than that they are similar to DLL8 (3-hole stock,
 duplex) and should not be specified on sysout class 'F'.  The
 applications are:

   AP     - Accounts Payable.
   CPI    - New loan system.
   DEFC   - Deferred Compensation.
   FA     - Fixed Assets.
   HEAD   - Applications using HEADLINE (such as the Deposit system).
   ICL    - Installment Credit Loans.

 In addition to the above, special form CPI causes each report group
 separator page to be printed on a colored sheet.

 Special form CPIS is similar to form CPI in that each report group
 separator page is printed on a colored sheet, but it prints in simplex
 mode.  Specify sysout class 'F' when using form CPIS.


 Special forms USR1, USR2, and USR3 are used when the user wants more
 control over the printer than the other form types provide.  Use them
 as follows:

   USR1   - Same as standard DLL8 except no skip to new cut sheet DJDE
            commands are inserted between datasets.  User can send own
            DJDE commands except change paper stock or mode, which must
            remain 3-hole duplex.  User must control skipping to new
            cut sheets as needed.  Specify with any sysout class except
            class 'F'.

   USR2   - Same as SLL8.  No skip to new cut sheet DJDE commands are
            inserted between datasets.  User can send own DJDE commands
            except change paper stock or mode, which must remain 3-hole
            simplex.  Specify only with sysout class 'F'.

   USR3   - User must control all aspects of XEROX printer forms
            control thru DJDE commands.  User must supply DJDE commands
            to specify paper stock, mode (SIMPLEX or DUPLEX), format
            (PDE), flash (FORM), carrage control (VFU), etc.  If no
            control is specified, print defaults to USR2 with whatever
            stock and mode was last printed on the printer.  Specify
            only with sysout class 'F'.


 Special form EAA1 is used to print the Escrow Account Analysis.  It
 invokes a special flash for each side of the paper (white no-hole).
 Specify sysout class 'F' when using form EAA1.
..PAGE
..SEC *.*.* XEROX FORMS OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS
..SPACE
 The implementation of our XEROX forms control system modifies how the
 operator manages print going to the XEROX printer.  With the exception
 of the initial setup message after the XEROX printer is started from
 JES2, setup messages for paper stock changes will appear on the XEROX
 operator console instead of the MVS operator console.  Our standard
 print will be on white 3-hole paper in duplex mode, which is forced
 for all sysout classes except class 'F'.  Print output requiring
 stock other than white 3-hole, and/or requiring simplex mode will be
 limited to sysout class 'F', thus letting the operator control when
 print setups will occur.  Stopping, draining, or halting the XEROX
 printer from JES2 will cause a setup message on the XEROX console for
 the next print output sent to it, thus insuring that the operator
 check the stock and mode after service is performed on the printer.

 JES2 determines that a printer is a XEROX laser printer (and requires
 special forms control) by checking the state of SEPDS (as displayed by
 a $DU,PRTn command).  SEPDS=Y indicates this is a XEROX printer, while
 SEPDS=N indicates this is not a XEROX printer.  The state of SEPDS is
 set when JES2 comes up, but can be changed by the operator if
 necessary (such as testing XEROX forms control with the MEMOREX
 printer, when a printer is moved, or when a problem is encountered
 with the JES2 exits performing the forms control function).  Contact
 Technical Support when permanent changes should be made to the SEPDS
 state of any particular printer.

 Note:  Always have S=Y and SEPDS=Y set for the XEROX printer.  All
 other printers should have SEPDS=N set.

..SEC *.*.*.* CONTROLLING XEROX OUTPUT PRIORITY

 JES2 will print all of the output for a given forms id in one class
 before going on to print sysout with a different forms id.  Because
 sysout class F is the only class which allows operator setup form ids,
 it is important to not change a report's sysout class from or to class
 F.  If you wish to cause a report to print ahead of another report,
 use the following procedure:

     1) Increase the report's print priority:  $TOJnnnn,ALL,P=255

     2) If the report's sysout class is different from the one
        currently being printed, then change the printer to print the
        desired sysout class next:  $TPRTn,Q=c...

     3) If the report's form id is different from the one currently
        being printed, then change the printer to print the desired
        form id next:  $TPRTn,F=form

..SEC *.*.*.* XEROX FORMS EXCEPTIONS

 If the operator encounters print setups for standard white 3-hole
 paper, duplex mode, while printing sysout class 'F' only, he or she
 should direct an incident report to the person submitting the job
 creating the output instructing them to use a different sysout class
 or form (refer them to the standards).

 If the operator encounters print setups for other than standard white
 3-hole paper, duplex mode, while printing sysout classes other than
 'F', he or she should direct an incident report to Mike Sheedy to
 correct the situation.
..PAGE
..SEC *.*.*.* XEROX FORMS OPERATOR MESSAGES

 The following messages will display on the XEROX operator console to
 inform the operator of what is printing and what setup is required:

 -0- j nnn jobname  c-form xxxPLEX

     Message occurs at the time output is to actually start to print
     on the printer.  'j nnn' is the JES2 job number, 'jobname ' is
     the name of the job creating the output,  'c' is the sysout class,
     'form' is the specified form id, and 'xxxPLEX' is the print mode
     (SIMPLEX, DUPLEX, or ??-PLEX).  This message is informative only.
     No operator action is required.

 -*- PRINT SWITCHING TO SIMPLEX MODE

     The printer is switching to SIMPLEX mode.  The operator must
     change the paper around for SIMPLEX operation (front facing down,
     top on your left).  In the case of standard white 3-hole paper,
     the holes point into the printer.

 -*- PRINT SWITCHING TO  DUPLEX MODE

     The printer is switching to DUPLEX mode.  The operator must change
     the paper around for DUPLEX operation (front facing up, top on
     your left).  In the case of standard white 3-hole paper, the holes
     point out of the printer.

 -*-LOAD STD 3-HOLE PAPER--xxxPLEX MODE

     The printer is preparing to print on standard white 3-hole paper
     in the indicated mode (DUPLEX or SIMPLEX).  The operator must
     load the printer with standard white 3-hole paper stock in the
     indicated mode.

 -*-LOAD WHT NOHOLE PAPER--xxxPLEX MODE

     The printer is preparing to print on standard white nohole paper
     in the indicated mode (DUPLEX or SIMPLEX).  The operator must
     load the printer with standard white nohole paper stock.  The
     mode doesn't matter with standard white nohole paper.

 -*-LOAD STATEMENT FORMS---xxxPLEX MODE

     The printer is preparing to print on statement paper stock in the
     indicated mode (DUPLEX or SIMPLEX).  The operator must load the
     printer with statement paper stock in the indicated mode.

 -*-LOAD B.F. LETTERHEAD---xxxPLEX MODE

     The printer is preparing to print on Benj. Franklin letterhead
     stock in the indicated mode (DUPLEX or SIMPLEX).  The operator
     must load the printer with Benj. Franklin letterhead stock in the
     indicated mode.

 -*-*-CHANGE PAPER NOW-*-*-

     The printer is waiting for the operator to perform the setup
     specified in the previous message.  Perform the indicated setup
     and hit the 'CONTINUE' key ('CONTINUE 0').


 If the XEROX printer is waiting for the operator to perform a setup
 operation and JES2 has output it wants to send to the printer, an
 intervention required message will be displayed on the MVS console.
 This message will go away after the operator performs the necessary
 setup on the XEROX printer and printing resumes.
..PAGE
..SEC *.*.*.* XEROX PRINTER SERVICING

 If service needs to be performed on the XEROX printer the operator
 should follow this procedure:

   1) Stop the XEROX printer from JES2:

          Enter on MVS console:  V 60A,OFFLINE
                                 $P PRT4
          Wait for printer status to be 'DRAINED'
             (can check status by enterring:  $DU,PRT4 )

   2) Print all output remaining in the XEROX printer (if possible):

          Enter on the XEROX console:  END
          Perform print setups as needed.
          Empty the output hoppers:  @U

   3) Take the XEROX printer offline (if possible):

          Enter on the XEROX console:  OFF
          Receive:  OS2570 VARY SYSTEM OFFLINE AT THE HOST AND
                    ENTER "CONTINUE I"
          Enter on the MVS console:    V 60A,OFFLINE
                                       S S
          Receive either:  IEF281I 60A NOW OFFLINE
                      or:  IEE303I 60A      OFFLINE
          Hit the 'CONTINUE' key on the XEROX console.

   4) Perform the required XEROX servicing.

 When the servicing is done and the printer is ready to resume printing
 JES2 output do the following:

   1) If you were not able to print all of the output remaining in the
      printer prior to servicing it, make sure that the paper stock in
      use prior to servicing is put back in the printer in the same
      mode (DUPLEX or SIMPLEX) as before.

   2) Place the printer online:

          Enter on the XEROX console:  ONL

   3) Start the default program:

          Enter on the XEROX console:  STA

   4) Select the JES2 sysout classes to be printed (if a change is
      desired):

          Enter on MVS console:  $T PRT4,Q=ccc...

   5) Start the XEROX printer to JES2:

          Enter on MVS console:  V 60A,ONLINE
                                 $S PRT4
          You will receive a forms setup message from JES2.
          Enter on MVS console:  $S PRT4

   6) When the first new output sent to the XEROX printer is ready to
      print you will recieve a print setup message on the XEROX
      console:

          Perform the indicated print setup (if needed) and hit the
          'CONTINUE' key on the XEROX console.
..PAGE
..SEC *.*.*.* XEROX TESTING WITH ALTERNATE JESA

 An alternate version of JES2 (named JESA) can be used to test
 modifications the JES2 exits and tables used in XEROX printer forms
 control.  Other than requiring that JES2 be up and running, JESA runs
 independent of JES2, and has its own spool, initiators, readers, and
 unit record devices.  JESA can abend without affecting operation
 outside of its control (although it can cause a system dump which may
 tie up operations for up to 30 seconds).

 The alternate version of JES2 cannot interface with TSO, SDSF, or the
 MVS SYSLOG.  Jobs to be run under JESA must be submitted either by a
 started task running under the control of JESA (see AUTA below), or
 via cards entered thru a card reader allocated to JESA (alternate JESA
 card readers must be re-started for each job read).  Note that all
 JESA operator messages and commands are prefixed with a slash (/)
 instead of a dollar sign ($).  The following instructions describe how
 to bring up, use, and take down JESA:

 Bring JESA up:

    Confirm with Technical Support that JESA is available for testing.
    Enter on MVS console:  S JESA
    Receive:  *nn $HASP426 SPECIFY OPTIONS - JES2 SP v.r.m
    Enter on MVS console:  nn,U
    Receive:  /HASP400 ENTER REQUESTS
    Enter on MVS console:  /S

 Bring JESA job submitter up:

    Enter on MVS console:  S AUTA,SUB=JESA

 Submit jobs to run under JESA control (note JESA spool is small):

    Enter on MVS console:  F AUTA,jobname,D=07  for jobs out of
                                                SYS2.JES2136.EXITSRC

 Controlling JESA:

    All JESA operator messages start with a slash (/) instead of a
    dollar sign ($).
    All JESA operator commands start with a slash (/) instead of a
    dollar sign ($).

 Transfer printer n from JES2 to JESA:

    Stop printer n from JES2:  $P PRTn
    Wait for printer status to be 'DRAINED'
       (can check status by enterring:  $DU,PRTn )
    Print all output remaining in the XEROX printer:
       Enter on the XEROX console:  END
       Perform print setups as needed.
       Empty the output hoppers:  @U
       Enter on the XEROX console:  STA
    Modify JESA printer options as needed:  /T PRTn,Q=ccc... etc.
    Start printer n to JESA:   /S PRTn

 Return printer n from JESA back to JES2:

    Stop printer n from JESA:  /P PRTn
    Wait for printer status to be 'DRAINED'
       (can check status by enterring:  /DU,PRTn )
    Print all output remaining in the XEROX printer:
       Enter on the XEROX console:  END
       Perform print setups as needed.
       Empty the output hoppers:  @U
       Enter on the XEROX console:  STA
    Modify JES2 printer options as needed:  $T PRTn,Q=ccc... etc.
    Start printer n to JES2:   $S PRTn

 Take JESA down normally:

    Take JESA job submitter down (if up):  P AUTA
    Stop any printers JESA has started:    /P PRTn
    Stop any initiators JESA has started:  /PI
    Wait for all active JESA jobs and output to complete.
    Receive:  /HASP099 ALL AVAILABLE FUNCTIONS COMPLETE
    Drain JESA:  /P
    Receive:  /HASP623 SYSTEM DRAINING
    Stop JESA:   /P JES2
    Receive:  /HASP085 JES2 TERMINATION COMPLETE

 Take JESA down abnormally:

    Attempt normal JESA take down if possible.
    Force JESA down with JES command if possible:  /P JES2,ABEND
      (Note: If JESA won't come down with /P JES2,ABEND command then it
       may be necessary to force it down with OMEGAMON or LOOK.)
    Receive:  */HASP095 JES2 CATASTROPHIC ERROR.  CODE = $PJ2  ...
               /HASP088 ...
               /HASP088 ...
              *nn /HASP098 ENTER TERMINATION OPTION
    If a system dump is desired enter:   nn,DUMP    (takes 30 seconds)
    Purge JESA from system if possible:  nn,PURGE
    Receive:  */HASP086 WARNING - JES2 CHECKPOINT LOCK NOT RELEASED
               /HASP085 JES2 TERMINATION COMPLETE
               IEF450I JESA JESA - ABEND S02D U0000 - TIME=hh.mm.ss

    After JESA comes down abnormally, it may be desirable to bring it
    up again ('hot start') and take it down normally to clear out any
    JESA initiators or the JESA job submitter.

 JESA hot start:

    Same as bringing JESA up normally (but done after a JESA abend and
    prior to an MVS IPL).

..PAGE
..SEC *.*.* JES2 EXIT1TAB FORMS TABLES CHANGES

 This section outlines the procedures used to create, modify, test, and
 turnover changes to the JES2 XEROX Forms Control Tables.  Use the
 following checklist to assist you in making XEROX forms changes:

    1) Set a tentative implementation date for your changes.  If it
       will be within the next week or so, you may want to schedule the
       change with the Change Board prior to developement to make their
       tuesday change submission deadline.  JES2 exit changes are
       always Severity Code 1 changes.

    2) Design your new form or plan your modifications/corrections.
       Determine the changes to be made to the default and global JSLs
       in SMNP.ZM041.XEROXLIB.  Determine the changes to be made to the
       JES2 XEROX Froms Control Tables in
       SYS2.JES2136.EXITSRC(EXIT1TAB).

    3) Run the changes passed Mike Sheedy in Technical Support and
       Linda Clifton in Operations Scheduling for system impact
       verification.

    4) Make the necessary changes to the default and global JSLs in
       SMNP.ZM041.XEROXLIB to support your new form.

    5) Make the necessary changes to SYS2.JES2136.EXITSRC(EXIT1TAB) to
       support your new form.  If it is necessary to compress
       SYS2.JES2136.EXITSRC use job SYS2.JES2136.EXITSRC($COMP).

    6) Run SYS2.JES2136.EXITSRC($ASM1) to assemble JES2 EXIT1MIT with
       your changes in SYS2.JES2136.EXITSRC(EXIT1TAB).  Verify that the
       assembly completes without errors (if errors, return to step 2).

    7) Bring up the secondary JESA and test your forms changes through
       it.  Run and print SYS2.JES2136.EXITSRC($TEST1) under JESA and
       verify that standard forms print ok (if errors, return to step
       2).

    8) Run SYS2.JES2136.EXITSRC($PREP1) to prepare the production
       libraries for turnover of the modified JES2 exits.  Verify that
       the preparation job completes without errors (if errors, contact
       Mike Sheedy).  Note: It is ok for the first step to not be able
       to scratch EXIT1MIB and/or TEC021B if they don't already exits.

    9) Schedule the implementation date for the JES2 exit changes with
       the Change Board.  The JES2 exit changes are Severity Code 1
       changes.  Note that the Change Board meets on Tuesdays.

   10) Inform Operations if new paper stock is involved.

   11) Submit a Documentation Update Request (IS-1259) to the ISD
       Administration Department to update section 6.9.1 XEROX LASER
       PRINTER FORM IDs within the JCL STANDARDS online manual, chapter
       6, with the changes you are making to the XEROX forms.

   12) Schedule the JES2 EXIT1MIT turnover with Operations.  See the
       next two sections for sample turnover and backout procedures for
       the operator to follow.  Basically, you run
       SYS2.JES2136.EXITSRC($TURN1) to turnover EXIT1MIT and perform a
       JES2 hot-start (do at night with IMS down).  To backout EXIT1MIT
       after it has been turned over you run
       SYS2.JES2136.EXITSRC($BACK1) and perform another JES2 hot-start.

   12) Inform requestor and update the Change Calendar when the
       turnover completes and the new forms are in production.

..PAGE

××××××  30 12MAR86 10:58 25MAR86   Preparation for Switching to DUPLEX

    Date: March 12, 1986
    To:   Informations Systems Staff and EDP Auditing
    From: Mike Sheedy, ext 229
    Re:   Preparation for Switching to Duplex Print

    When printing output via the XEROX 8700 Laser Printer, we currently
    default to 'simplex' mode, which is to print on only the front side
    of each cut sheet of paper.  In a few weeks we will be changing our
    default to 'duplex' mode, which is to print on both front and back
    of each cut sheet of paper.  We are making modifications to MVS
    JES2 to insure that each sysout file created on a separate DD
    statement will have its first page begin on the front side of a new
    cut sheet.  The same goes for multiple copies of sysout files
    specified via the COPIES operand in MVS JCL.  Unfortunately, we
    cannot insure that multiple reports within a single sysout file
    (ie: on a single DD statement) will have their first pages begin on
    the front sides of new cut sheets unless special provisions are
    made for each occurance.

    Besides the problem of multiple reports printing through a single
    DD statement, there may be reports which should continue to print
    simplex after we change the default to duplex (such as pages filed
    by customer or branch, or sent to customers).  In order to minimize
    disruptions to our report users, we are asking that you review the
    applications you support and note which jobs and sysout files will
    need special consideration, either because multiple reports are
    being produced on a single DD statement, or the sysout needs to
    continue to print in simplex mode.  I have been in contact with
    programmers supporting the following applications in performing
    this task: AP, CPI, FA, GMT, and ICL.  Please contact me or send me
    a note if we have missed you, or you know of production jobs
    needing the special sysout considerations described above.  We will
    work out the changes needed with Scheduling and Operations.

    Also, watch for a NEWS update which will give instructions you can
    use to make necessary test output print in simplex mode after we
    switch the default to duplex mode.  While duplex will be preferred
    and have higher priority, we recognize that there will be special
    instances where simplex may be required in test.

    Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns
    regarding printing on the XEROX Laser Printer and/or duplex mode.
    Thank you.

××××××  50 15APR86 10:30 05MAY86   Switch to DUPLEX PRINT on XEROX 8700

    Effective April 22, 1986, the default print mode for the XEROX
    8700 Laser Printer will be changed to 'duplex' mode.  This will
    cause standard output to print on both front and back of each cut
    sheet of paper.

    Modifications have been made to MVS/JES2 to insure each sysout file
    created with a separate DD statement will have its first page begin
    on the front side of a new cut sheet.  The same goes for multiple
    copies of sysout files specified via the COPIES operand in MVS JCL.
    Special JCL provisions have been made for those production applica-
    tions which have multiple reports being produced with a single DD
    statement, or whose sysout needs to continue to print in 'simplex'
    mode, as identified to us by Systems and Programming (see past
    NEWS bulletin #30).

    ISD users may have questions or problems regarding their reports
    printing duplex.  If a duplex-printed production report is not
    being properly separated from the previous report, or a report is
    not being printed in simplex mode when it should be, ISD Scheduling
    will need to be informed to correct the production JCL.

    New documentation regarding Sysout classes and forms IDs for use
    with the XEROX printer will soon be added to the Standards and Pro-
    cedures Manual, sections 6.9 and 6.9.1 (available online via
    =U.D.1;6).  Please review this documentation.  Some use recommend-
    ations follow below:

    WHAT THE PAPER HARDCOPY PRINT CLASSES ARE FOR:

    Sysout classes A, O, P, and Y route output to the XEROX 8700 laser
    printer, which prints 8-1/2 x 11 cut, 3-hole, white sheet paper
    in duplex mode.  Classes A, O, and P are reserved for production
    reports; Sysout class Y should be used for tests, compiles, and
    documentation.

    Sysout class F also routes output to the XEROX 8700 and is used for
    any test or production output requiring operator setup. This can be
    output which needs to print in simplex mode, or must print on cut
    sheet paper other than 3-hole white, such as statement forms. When
    choosing form IDs for your output, use the Sysout class and form ID
    combinations soon to be documented in the JCL chapter of the
    Standards manual, section 6.9.1.

    Sysout class M routes output to the MEMOREX 4303 impact printer,
    which prints continuous fan-fold paper (11x14) and labels.

    NOTE:  Do not use form IDs with XEROX printer Sysout classes
           not defined to the XEROX printer, such as 11NH, 11AA, etc.
           These will be ignored, and your output will print as if no
           form id had been specified.  Use FCBs on output directed
           to the MEMOREX printer only. The XEROX printer ignores all
           specified FCBs.


    HOW TO PRINT PORTRAIT ORIENTATION:

    To print documentation generated by program TEC250 in portrait
    orientation (ie: narrow side of paper at top), use Sysout class Y
    and form ID DPB8.  By using this form ID, it is no longer necessary
    to send your own DJDE command to the XEROX printer.  DPB8 prints
    in duplex mode on 3-hole white cut sheet paper.  Lower-case charac-
    ters print as lower-case characters. Below is a JCL example to use:

          //SYSUT2   DD  SYSOUT=(Y,,DPB8)


    HOW TO PRINT 2-UP:

    To print output 2-up (ie: two logical pages on each side of a
    physical cut sheet), use Sysout class Y and form ID D2B8. This will
    print duplex mode on 3-hole white cut sheet paper, portrait orient-
    ation.  Much paper can be saved printing ABEND dumps 2-up. The
    following is an example of the JCL to use:

          //SYSUDUMP DD  SYSOUT=(Y,,D2B8)


    HOW TO PRINT MULTIPLE REPORTS DUPLEX MODE ON A SINGLE DD STATEMENT:

    Uses the COPIES=n operand on the DD statement if you are printing
    multiple copies of the same report with one DD statement. If working
    with an application which prints more than one different report with
    the same DD statement, special duplex form IDs have been set up.
    Refer to the special form IDs AP, CPI, DEFC, FA, HEAD, and ICL soon
    to be documented in the JCL chapter of the Standards Manual, section
    6.9.1.  The following is an example of the JCL to use to print two
    reports created by the HEADLINE subroutine printing on the same DD
    statement:

          //ddname   DD  SYSOUT=(Y,,HEAD)


    HOW TO PRINT SIMPLEX MODE:

    Duplex printing is preferred and has higher priority, but there
    will be special instances where simplex mode is required in testing.
    Use Sysout class F and form ID SLL8 to print standard output in
    simplex mode (the default prior to April 22, 1986).  The following
    is an example of the JCL to use:

          //ddname   DD  SYSOUT=(F,,SLL8)

    To print documentation generated by program TEC250 in simplex mode,
    use sysout class F and form id SPB8.  Sample JCL would be:

          //SYSUT2   DD  SYSOUT=(F,,SPB8)

    To have your JCL listings also print simplex, specify MSGCLASS=F
    on your JOB statement and add the following JCL statement after
    your JOB statement:

          //OUTJCL   OUTPUT JESDS=ALL,CLASS=F,FORMS=SLL8

    To get an entire job to print simplex, including JCL listings,
    specify MSGCLASS=F on your JOB statement, Sysout class=F without
    any form IDs on all of your Sysout DD statements, and add the
    following two JCL statements after your JOB statement:

          //OUTJCL   OUTPUT JESDS=ALL,CLASS=F,FORMS=SLL8
          //OUTDEF   OUTPUT DEFAULT=YES,CLASS=F,FORMS=SLL8

..SEC *.* EXIT1A LOGIC
..SEC *.*.* EXIT1A DESCRIPTION

    EXIT1A FUNCTIONS:

        .  TELLS XEROX PRINTER AS REGARDS WHAT FORM AND WHAT
           PDE'S ARE REQUIRED FOR THIS OUTPUT VIA DJDE FORMS
           IMAGE TABLE ENTRY (DFITE).

        .  SETS THE MODE OF PRINTER OPERATION (DUPLEX OR SIMPLEX)
           AND TELLS OPERATOR WHEN TO SWITCH PAPER AROUND (PSMTE).

        .  PAPER TRAY MESSAGE TABLE ENTRY (PTMTE) USED TO TELL
           OPERATOR WHAT TYPE OF STOCK PAPER TO LOAD INTO XEROX
           PRINTER.

        .  DISPLAYS JOBNAME ASSOCIATED WITH THIS OUTPUT AT THE
           XEROX PRINTER CONTROL CONSOLE VIA PAGE SETUP MESSAGE
           TABLE ENTRY (PSMTE).

        .  SPECIFIES ADDITIONAL CONTROL VIA DJDE VFU IMAGE
           TABLE ENTRY (DVITE).

        .  PASSES PRINTER AND FORMS SETUP INFORMATION ON TO OTHER
           JES2 USER EXITS, AND TO ITSELF FOR ITS NEXT INVOCATION
           (PRNTRTAB).

    ENVIRONMENT:

        EXTENSION OF JES2 MAIN TASK SERVING HASPPRPU.

    DEPENDENCIES:

           THIS EXIT IS COPIED INTO EXIT1MIT AT ASSEMBLY TIME.

           REQUIRES EXIT1MIT, EXIT1REG, EXIT1A, AND EXIT1TAB BE
           ASSEMBLED TOGETHER.  EXIT1B, EXIT5, EXIT15, AND
           EXIT250 ARE RECOMMENDED BE ASSEMBLED WITH IT ALSO.

           IF THIS EXIT IS DISABLED, JES2 CONTINUES WITH THE
           STANDARD HASPPRPU.


    RESTRICTIONS:

           -  THIS EXIT SHOULD CONFORM TO JES2 RE-ENTRANCY
              REQUIREMENTS (I.E., NOT THE OS/VS RE-ENTRANCY
              REQUIREMENTS).

           -  NO OS/VS IO/EXCP ALLOWED IN THIS EXIT.  THE I/O
              ACTIVITIES SHOULD BE LIMITED ONLY TO HAM/RTAM, AND
              NO OTHER ACCESS METHOD.

           -  NO OS/VS MACRO ALLOWED IN THIS EXIT. THE MACROS
              SHOULD BE LIMITED ONLY TO THOSE STARTING WITH $
              SIGN, E.G., STANDARD JES2 MACROS.


    CONSTRAINTS:

        .  SEPARATOR TRUNCATION:  THE SEPARATOR (BANNER PAGE)
                  GETS TRUNCATED ON PORTRAIT FORM. TO AVOID
                  THIS PROBLEM, THE USERS SHOULD PROVIDE THEIR
                  OWN LOGIC (ANOTHER 500 - 600 LINES OF CODE).
                  OUR SOLUTION TO THIS IS IN BF EXIT1B.


        .  MULTIPLE COPY SEPARATOR:  THIS MODULE DOES NOT
                  PROVIDE SEPARATOR FOR MULTIPLE COPY SYSOUT.
                  OUR SOLUTION IS IN BF EXIT15.

        .  DUPLEXING:  THIS MODULE SUPPORTS DUPLEXING WHEN USED
                  WITH BF EXIT15.

        .  MODULE SIZE:  THIS MODULE USES ONLY ONE REGISTER
                  TO BASE ADDRESS THE PROGRAM. THOSE WHO USE
                  A LARGE NUMBER OF FORMS MAY HAVE TO HAVE
                  ANOTHER REGISTER FOR BASE ADDRESSING.

        .  RECOVERY TERMINATION:  THIS MODULE DOES NOT HAVE
                  ESTAE LOGIC, BUT RUNS ERROR FREE. NEVERTHELESS
                  THE RECOVERY/TERMINATION LOGIC SHOULD BE
                  PROVIDED (USE $ESTAE).
