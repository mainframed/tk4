    REASM makes it possible to restore sources using previousely prepare
control block definitions. A special utility (PRCBGEN) shipped together
REASM converts standard assembler DSECT definitions into the correspondi
modules which may be used by the REASM. Load library%REASM.CNTL+shipped
together with the REASM contains prepared load modules for majority of t
popular MVS blocks.

    To keep this library up to date and to refresh it you may use the JC
examples which may be found in the library%REASM.USER+
