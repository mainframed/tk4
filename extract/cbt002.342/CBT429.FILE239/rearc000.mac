   Reasm recovery is pretty similar to the ISPF recovery. Reasm is able
the current state and let you restart from the hot point in future.

   The important notes about the REASM recovery are:
   - Once you switched recovery ON, REASM will write the backup file aft
'n' changes. In case you specified too small value the response time may
dramatically grow up !

   - You can preallocate the REASM recovery file as the sequential or
partitioned data set. If you choose the library REASM will be able to ke
number of backup files as the members of this library. In this case the
handling of the library overflow is your responsibility.
