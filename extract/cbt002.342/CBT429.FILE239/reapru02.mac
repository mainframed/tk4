    -%@Name+      - Name of the DSECT block. This is a way to set the ba
register for predefined control block or user defined DSECT. Once Reasm
receives such operand it tries to find the appropriate control block in
load library, defined by the DD card REASMBLK. If the block is found the
loads it and sets a base.  In future all the references to the fields in
control block will be translated to the names from the control block
description.  Reasm will accept also the comments related to the control
fields.
                    === Example ===
                   %USING @CVT,R3+  - Set base for control block 'CVT'.
                                      If the command was:
                                     %TM  116(R3),X'13'+
                                      then its new form will be:
                                     %TM  CVTDCB,X'13'   OPERATING SYSTE
