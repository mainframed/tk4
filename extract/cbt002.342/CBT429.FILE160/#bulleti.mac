)F FUNCTION -
    The BULLETIN command is used for maintenance of the bulletin
    messages in the broadcast dataset.

)X SYNTAX -
    BULLETIN   CLEAR(nn)  BROADCAST(dsn)
               NOCLEAR    NOBROADCAST

    ALIASES  - none

    DEFAULTS - NOCLEAR, NOBROADCAST
             - If CLEAR is used:  CLEAR(30)
             - If BROADCAST is used:  BROADCAST('SYS1.BULLETIN.DATA')
    REQUIRED - none

)O OPERANDS -

))CLEAR(nn)
    The maximum number of messages to clear from the broadcast
    dataset.  DEFAULT:  CLEAR(30)

))NOCLEAR
    Messages will not be cleared from the broadcast dataset.

))BROADCAST(dsn)
    Messages will be added to the broadcast dataset using 'dsn'
    as input.  DEFAULT:  BROADCAST('SYS1.BULLETIN.DATA')

))NOBROADCAST
    Messages will not be added to the broadcast dataset.

))EXAMPLES
    1.  To add an item temporarily to the bottom of the bulletin
        board, from your own MYLIB.DATA(MEMO1):

            BULLETIN B(MYLIB.DATA(MEMO1))

    3.  To clear up to 15 lines from the broadcast dataset:

            BULLETIN C(15)

    4.  To clear up to 30 lines from the broadcast dataset, and
        to recreate the bulletins from the system bulletin dataset:

            BULLETIN C B

)S SUBCOMMANDS -
    The BULLETIN command has no subcommands.
)M
))BUL0001I text

    This is the first 71 characters of text processed by the
    BULLETIN command.  Apostrophes will be expanded to double
    apostrophes.

))BUL0002I CLEAR operation complete.

    A number of messages have been cleared from the broadcast
    dataset through use of the CLEAR operand of the command.

))BUL0003E OPERATOR authority is required for CLEAR or BROADCAST.

    The CLEAR or BROADCAST operation was not performed because the
    you did not have OPERATOR authority.  Contact your computer
    security administrator.

))BUL0004E Input file must have 80-byte, fixed length records.

    The BROADCAST operation was not performed because the input
    dataset was in a format which BULLETIN could not process.
    Copy the text to a dataset with fixed length, 80-byte records
    and try again.

))BUL0005C Unable to process date: xxxxxxxx.  Current date assumed.

    A date field on a '-dates' input card image was not in the
    format of MM/DD/YY.  BULLETIN assumed the current date for
    both the start and stop dates.  Check for two-digit MM, DD,
    and YY.  Check for MM less than 13, and DD less than 32.
    Also check for a slash (/) in the third and sixth positions,
    and check for the correct starting position of the date on
    the card image.  (E.g., '-dates 07/04/76 07/05/76')

))BUL0006E Line ignored.  Too many apostrophes (46, max).

    BULLETIN must change apostrophes in your input into double
    apostrophes before passing the text along to MVS.  When more
    than 46 apostrophes are used, the total line length is longer
    than the operating system can accept, so the text line cannot
    be placed into the broadcast dataset.  Revise the text and
    try again.

))BUL0007C CLEAR function ignored.  Quantity less than 1.

    CLEAR(n) was used, and the value of 'n' was less than 1.
    Note that if you want to prevent clearing message lines, you
    should use NOCLEAR (which is the default) instead of
    CLEAR(0).
