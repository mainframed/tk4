GENERAL:

    SAFECOPY is a copy command which enables several users to
    update the same dataset simultaneously, without conflicting
    with each other or with users who are reading the dataset.
    SAFECOPY is especially useful in CLISTs which write to a
    common dataset.

    Syntax -

     SAFECOPY  FROMDSNAME(dsname×*)   TODSNAME(dsname)
     SAFEC     FROMDATASET(dsname×*)  TODATASET(dsname)
               FROMFILE(filename)     TOFILE(filename)
               FROMDDNAME(filename)   TODDNAME(filename)

INSTALLATION CHECK LIST:

(  )  1.  The following non-IBM macros are used to assemble
          SAFECOPY. If you already have older versions in your
          system, replace them with the ones from this PDS.

            EQ$R     - Register equates.
            GTEDAALC - Execute SVC99 and IKJEFF18 (DAIRFAIL).
            GTEDADAT - Create SVC99/IKJEFF18 control blocks.
            GTEDASET - Link SVC99/IKJEFF18 control blocks together.
            LINKBACK - Linkage conventions out.
            LINKSAVE - Linkage conventions in.

(  )  2.  The following macro is documentation for the GTEDAxxx
          macros, above.  It is not used by SAFECOPY, but should
          be copied into your system.

            GTEDADOC - Documentation of GTEDAxxx macros.

(  )  3.  The major queue name is 'USERDSN' and is at label 'QNAM1'.
          Because all SAFECOPY users enqueue on this name, they
          do not conflict with each other.  You may want to
          use one of these other names so that SAFECOPY users
          will not conflict with users of these other utilities:

            SPFUSER  - ISPF/PDF Edit and Utilities.
            SYSIEWLP - Linkage Editor SYSLMOD files.

(  )  4.  For a non-SMP install, run the jobstream in member
          SAFECJCL of this PDS. Recommended load libraries are:

          A.  SYS1.CMDLIB
          B.  library named on the LNKLST

          Add a JOB card at the top, and edit the last few lines
          to provide the name of the selected load library, HELP
          library, and the name of this PDS.

          The jobstream does the following:

          A.  Assembles SAFECOPY using the source in member
              SAFECOPY of this PDS.

              Note: Access to SYS1.AMODGEN is required because
                    SAFECOPY uses the CVT macro.

          B.  Linkedits SAFECOPY into the selected load library,
              assigning an alias of SAFEC. Attributes are RENT,
              REUS and REFR.

          C.  IEBCOPYs member #SAFECOP and alias entry #SAFEC to the
              selected HELP library, renaming them SAFECOPY and
              SAFEC.

(  )      For an SMP install, follow your installation's procedures
          for installation of a RENT, REUS, REFR module into
          LPALIB, LINKLIB, CMDLIB, or another library on the
          LNKLST, with the HELP member being installed as a
          ++MAC into HELP or another library in the SYSHELP
          concatenation.   The ++MOD entry should have TALIAS(SAFEC),
          and the ++MAC entry should have MALIAS(SAFEC).

(  )  5.  If you select SYS1.LPALIB as your target library, you
          will need to IPL, including 'CLPA' in the response to
          the system parameters prompt.  This will create a new
          LPA, picking up your SAFECOPY and SAFEC alias in the
          process.

(  )      If you have Dynamic BLDL, and already have a version
          of SAFECOPY installed, you will have to stop and restart
          the Dynamic BLDL table.

(  )      If you have ACF2 and are using command limiting lists,
          and are not already running a version of SAFECOPY, you
          must do either one of the following:

          A.  Turn the ALLCMDS bit on in the LOGONID of selected
              users, and invoke SAFECOPY with the '#' prefix.
              That is, use the alias name #SAFEC. This limits the
              use of SAFECOPY only to those LOGONIDs with the
              ALLCMDS bit on.  Turn the bit on with the following
              sequence from TSO READY state using a LOGONID with
              appropriate authority to change the bit.

                   ACF
                   LIST logonid
                   CHANGE * ALLCMDS
                   END

          B.  Add the following macro to the command limiting
              list, then assemble, link, and IPL with CLPA.  This
              makes SAFECOPY available to everyone.

                   $TSOCMD  (SAFECOPY,SAFEC)
