          XPRINT  dataset-name  record-limit  NOTEST
          XP                                  TEST

          ALIAS: XP

          REQUIRED:  dataset-name
          DEFAULTS:  NOTEST


          Note - NOTEST/TEST are not documented in the HELP.
                 TEST is used to print the first 48 bytes of the
                 utility before it is invoked, and to write a
                 message telling whether or not the utility was
                 dynamically loaded.

INSTALLATION CHECK LIST:

(  )  1.  The following non-IBM macros are used to assemble
          XPRINT. If you already have older versions in your
          system, replace them with the ones from this PDS.

            GTEDAALC - Execute SVC99 and IKJEFF18 (DAIRFAIL).
            GTEDADAT - Create SVC99/IKJEFF18 control blocks.
            GTEDASET - Link SVC99/IKJEFF18 control blocks together.

(  )  2.  The following macro is documentation for the GTEDAxxx
          macros, above.  It is not used by XPRINT, but should
          be copied into your system.

            GTEDADOC - Documentation of GTEDAxxx macros.

      3.  Edit the source program.

(  )      A.  XPRINT is a frontend for a print utility, referred
              to as 'HEXPRINT' in the source.  Change the
              references at label VPGM and UTILNAME to the actual
              name of your utility.

(  )      B.  XPRINT allocates two files for the utility, their
              DDNAMEs are at labels INPUTLIT and LISTLIT.  They
              are in the source as 'INPUT' and 'LIST'.  Change
              them to the actual DDNAMEs used by your utility.

          C.  The utility does not have to be link edited in with
              the XPRINT module.  If the utility is not linked
              in, XPRINT will LOAD it from the system libraries
              at execution time.

              You should NOT link in the utility if:

              (1)  You are going to use LPA and the utility is
                   not reenterable, or for any other reason
                   cannot or should not go into LPA.

              (2)  The utility is maintained by people other than
                   those responsible for command processors.

              (3)  The utility will be used stand-alone, without
                   the front end.

              (4)  The utility is being changed frequently.

(  )          If you do want to link it in add the following line
              of JCL at the bottom of member XPJCL:

                 //LKED.UTILLIB  DD DSN=library-name,DISP=SHR

(  )          and also add the following LKED control statement
              at the top of member XPLNK:

                   INCLUDE UTILLIB(utility-pgm-name)

(  )  4.  For a non-SMP install, run the jobstream in member
          XPJCL of this PDS.  Recommended load libraries are:

          A.  SYS1.CMDLIB
          B.  library named on the LNKLST

          Add a JOB card at the top, and edit the last few lines
          to provide the name of the selected load library, HELP
          library, and the name of this PDS.

          The jobstream does the following:

          A.  Assembles XPRINT using the source in member
              XPRINT of this PDS.

              Note: Access to SYS1.AMODGEN is required because
                    XPRINT uses the CVT macro.

          B.  Linkedits XPRINT into the selected load library,
              assigning an alias of XP.  Attributes are RENT,
              REUS and REFR.

          C.  IEBCOPYs member #XP and alias entry #XPRINT to the
              selected HELP library, renaming them XPRINT and
              XP.

(  )      For an SMP install, follow your installation's procedures
          for installation of a RENT, REUS, REFR module into
          LPALIB, LINKLIB, CMDLIB, or another library on the
          LNKLST, with the HELP member being installed as a
          ++MAC into HELP or another library in the SYSHELP
          concatenation.   The ++MOD entry should have TALIAS(XP),
          and the ++MAC entry should have MALIAS(XP).

(  )  5.  If you select SYS1.LPALIB as your target library, you
          will need to IPL, including 'CLPA' in the response to
          the system parameters prompt.  This will create a new
          LPA, picking up your XPRINT and XP alias in the
          process.

(  )      If you have Dynamic BLDL, and already have a version
          of XPRINT installed, you will have to stop and restart
          the Dynamic BLDL table.

(  )      If you have ACF2 and are using command limiting lists,
          and are not already running a version of XPRINT, you
          must do either one of the following:

          A.  Turn the ALLCMDS bit on in the LOGONID of selected
              users, and invoke XPRINT with the '#' prefix.
              That is, use the name #XPRINT or alias #XP. This
              limits the use of XPRINT only to those LOGONIDs
              with the ALLCMDS bit on.  Turn the bit on with the
              following sequence from TSO READY state using a
              LOGONID with appropriate authority to change the
              bit.

                   ACF
                   LIST logonid
                   CHANGE * ALLCMDS
                   END

          B.  Add the following macro to the command limiting
              list, then assemble, link, and IPL with CLPA.  This
              makes XPRINT available to everyone.

                   $TSOCMD  (XPRINT,XP)
