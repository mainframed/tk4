)F Function -

  DSNCHECK is a command which checks the system catalogs for the
  existence of a dataset name or alias.  If a library (PDS) member
  name is specified with the dataset name, DSNCHECK will check for the
  existence of the named member.

)X Syntax

     DSNCHECK  dsname  LIST    VOLCHECK
     DSNC              NOLIST  NOVOLCHECK


  Required - none, you will be prompted for dsname
  Defaults - LIST, VOLCHECK
  Alias    - DSNC

  Return codes:  0 - successful in locating catalog entry, (and,
                     optionally, member name).
                12 - unsuccessful.

)O OPERANDS -

))dsname - The dataset name you are checking the catalog for.  If the
             name is enclosed in single quotes ('), it will be used as
             is.  If it is not enclosed in single quotes, your TSO
             prefix will be added to the beginning of the name.  If
             you want to check a library (PDS) for a particular member
             name, include the member name within parentheses at the
             end of the library name.
             Examples:
                  library (dataset) name: 'ABC.YOURLIB.TEXT'
                 library and member name: 'ABC.YOURLIB.TEXT(LETTER)'

))LIST - Causes DSNCHECK to write a message on the terminal screen
             saying whether or not the dataset was cataloged.  NOTE -
             LIST is the default.

))NOLIST - Supresses writing a message to the screen concerning
             whether or not the dataset was cataloged.  This is useful
             in CLISTs.

))VOLCHECK - Causes DSNCHECK to physically check the volume table of
             contents for the dataset, instead of just reporting on
             the existence of a catalog entry.
             Note: - With VOLCHECK, DSNCHECK requires more resources
                     and takes longer to run.  If your catalog entries
                     normally are correct, NOVOLCHECK should be used
                     instead.  Also, if you are using DSNCHECK to check
                     for names of tape datasets, NOVOLCHECK must be
                     used instead.
             Note: - The use of a member name with the dataset name
                     implies VOLCHECK.

))NOVOLCHECK - Causes DSNCHECK to bypass physically checking the
             volume table of contents for the dataset.
             Note: - The use of NOVOLCHECK requires fewer resources
                     and runs faster than the use of VOLCHECK.
             Note: - NOVOLCHECK must be used when using DSNCHECK for
                     tape datasets.
             Note: - If a member name is used with the dataset name,
                     NOVOLCHECK will be ignored.

))EXAMPLES -
             1.  Find out whether 'MASSTAX' is a member of
                 your own dataset called LIB.LOAD:
                       DSNCHECK  LIB.LOAD(MASSTAX)

             2.  Find out whether a catalog entry exists for
                 a dataset named: 'ABC1234.STARTUP.CLIST'
                       DSNCHECK  'ABC1234.STARTUP.CLIST'

             3.  Write a CLIST to execute a program named 'ACCTREPT'
                 if it exists in either library 'ABC.PROD.LOAD' or
                 'XYZ.TEST.LOAD':

                     PROC 0
                       DSNCHECK 'ABC.PROD.LOAD(ACCTREPT)' NOLIST
                       IF &LASTCC EQ 0 THEN +
                         DO
                           CALL 'ABC.PROD.LOAD(ACCTREPT)'
                           GOTO ENDING
                         END
                       DSNCHECK 'XYZ.TEST.LOAD(ACCTREPT)' NOLIST
                       IF &LASTCC EQ 0 THEN +
                         DO
                           CALL 'XYZ.TEST.LOAD(ACCTREPT)'
                           GOTO ENDING
                         END
                     ENDING: +
                       EXIT CODE(&MAXCC)
