)F Function -
     NEWSPACE is a command for easily creating new, moderately sized,
     datasets and libraries.  It was written with beginners in mind.
     (Larger or more complex datasets should be created with the
     ALLOCATE and ATTRIB commands, or with the ISPF/PDF Dataset Utility
     (Option 3.2))

)X Syntax -

   NEWSPACE  dataset-name  type   LIBRARY     FIXED         FILE(name)
                                  SEQUENTIAL  VARIABLE    DDNAME(name)
                                              UNFORMATTED
   REQUIRED:  dataset-name
   DEFAULTS:  1.  LIBRARY
              2.  FIXED, VARIABLE or UNFORMATTED, depending on type
                  or dataset-name.
              3.  If a FILE/DD name is not selected, a system-
                  generated name will be used.

)O Operands -

))dataset-name -
    The name of the dataset to be created.  If single quotes (') are
    placed around the name, it will be used as is.  If not, the TSO
    user prefix will be added to the front of the name, and the dataset
    'type', if used, will be added to the end.  For example, if your
    user prefix is ABC0:

            'ABC0.PROJECT.DATA'  will be used as is

                       PROGRAM1  will have the user prefix and type
                                 added to it.  If it is to contain
                                 FORTRAN statements, the name would
                                 become:  'ABC0.PROGRAM1.FORT'

))type -
    This designates the intended use of the dataset.  Datasets for
    different uses have different internal characteristics.  You do not
    have to specify 'type'.  'Types' recognized by NEWSPACE are:

    ASM     - Assembler programs     FORT    - FORTRAN PROGRAMS
    C       - C Language programs    LIST    - Program output listings
  * CLIST   - TSO Command Lists      LOAD    - Executable load modules
    CNTL    - Job Control Language   OBJ     - Compiler output (object)
    COBOL   - COBOL programs         PLI     - PL/1 programs
  * COMMAND - TSO Command Lists      PLIF    - PL/1(F) programs
    DATA    - General Data           TEXT    - Text, especially SCRIPT
 ** DIALOG  - ISPF DIALOG DATASETS   VSBASIC - IBM VS BASIC PROGRAMS


  _______
  * CLIST and COMMAND are the same, except for different default
    internal characteristics.  COMMAND type is used for personal CLISTs
    which are to be used as if they are TSO commands.  See the FIXED
    and VARIABLE operands, below.
 ** DIALOG is for the following files used with ISPF Dialog Manager:
                  FIXED - ISPPLIB, Panels
                  FIXED - ISPMLIB, Messages
                  FIXED - ISPSLIB, Skeletons
                  FIXED - ISPTLIB, Table Input
                  FIXED - ISPPROF, Profiles
                  FIXED - SYSPROC, CLISTs
            UNFORMATTED - ISPLLIB, Link Library

))SEQUENTIAL -
    The dataset will be constructed to hold a single group of data,
    such as one FORTRAN program, or one Memo.

))LIBRARY (or PARTITIONED, or PDS) -
    The dataset will be constructed as a library (partitioned dataset)
    which can hold many groups of data, such as many FORTRAN programs
    or many Memos.  LIBRARY IS THE DEFAULT.

))FIXED -
    All lines of data have the same length.  This is the default if no
    'type' is selected and the dataset name doesn't end with a 'type'
    name.  It is also the default if the following types are selected:

                ASM       COMMAND   LIST
                C         DATA      OBJ
                CNTL      DIALOG    PLIF
                COBOL     FORT

))VARIABLE -
    Each line of data may be a different length from the rest.  This
    is the default if one of these types is selected.

                CLIST      TEXT
                PLI        VSBASIC

))UNFORMATTED -
    This is the default format for LOAD datasets.  It is an optional
    format for DIALOG datasets, for the ISPLLIB file.

))FILE(name) -
    An optional 1-8 character file name to be used when creating
    the dataset.  Means the same thing as DDNAME.  This operand
    is not required.  If you do not select a DDNAME or FILE name,
    the system will generate one.

))DDNAME(name) -
    An optional 1-8 character file name to be used when creating
    the dataset.  Means the same thing as FILE.  This operand
    is not required.  If you do not select a DDNAME or FILE name,
    the system will generate one.

))Examples:

     (Assume your TSO user prefix is ABC0)


        1.  NEWSPACE  MYPROJ
                Creates library 'ABC0.MYPROJ'.  Since no TYPE is
                designated, and MYPROJ doesn't end in a TYPE name, a
                default internal characteristics are used.

        2.  NEWSPACE  MYPROJ  DATA
               - or - MYPROJ.DATA
                Creates library 'ABC0.MYPROJ.DATA', using the DATA type
                internal characteristics, with the default FIXED
                format.

        3.  NEWSPACE  MYPROJ.DATA  SEQUENTIAL
                Creates sequential dataset 'ABC0.MYPROJ.DATA'

        4.  NEWSPACE  MYPROJ.DATA  VARIABLE
                Creates library 'ABC0.MYPROJ.DATA', using the DATA type
                internal characteristics, and the VARIABLE format.

        5.  NEWSPACE 'XYZ9.SHARE.JOB82'
                Creates library 'XYZ9.SHARE.JOB82'.  Since no TYPE is
                designated, and JOB82 isn't a type name, the default
                internal characteristics are used.

        6.  NEWSPACE  MONEND  DATA  SEQUENTIAL  FILE(INRECS)
                Creates sequential dataset 'ABC0.MONEND.DATA' and
                associates it with file name (ddname) 'INRECS'.

          The dataset wasn't created because of some problem, such as
          another dataset already having the same name.

          created.
