INSTALLATION CHECK LIST:

(  )  1.  The following non-IBM macros are used to assemble
          BULLETIN. If you already have older versions in your
          system, replace them with the ones from this PDS.

            EQ$R     - Register equates.
            GTEDAALC - Execute SVC99 and IKJEFF18 (DAIRFAIL).
            GTEDADAT - Create SVC99/IKJEFF18 control blocks.
            GTEDASET - Link SVC99/IKJEFF18 control blocks together.
            LINKBACK - Linkage conventions out.
            LINKSAVE - Linkage conventions in.

(  )  2.  The following macro is documentation for the GTEDAxxx
          macros, above.  It is not used by BULLETIN, but should
          be copied into your system.

            GTEDADOC - Documentation of GTEDAxxx macros.

(  )  3.  This command interfaces with SVC-34, the Console Operator
          SVC.  To do so, the command must be authorized to
          use the MODESET macro to change into supervisor state,
          key zero.  This is usually done in one of two ways:

          A.  Use an installation-provided SVC which changes the
              JSCBAUTH bit in the JSCB.  This requires a minor
              change to the source in member BULLETIN.
          B.  Use this procedure:
              (1)  Linkedit with parm AC=1, or control card
                   SETCODE AC(1), into LINKLIB or a library on
                   the APF list.
              (2)  Add an entry into the APF command list in
                   module IKJEFTE2, which is a CSECT in IKJEFT02.
                   Sample code is in member BUJEFTE2.
             ==>   This should be done by an MVS systems programmer.

          There is much more detail in the comments in the source
          in member BULLETIN.  Read the comments and choose an
          authorization method.

(  )  4.  This command uses the STIMER macro, so it will not run
          correctly under ISPF.  Add an entry into ISPTCM.
          Details are explained in the comments in the source in
          member BULLETIN.  Sample code is in member BUISPTCM.
          This ISPTCM entry will prevent ISPF from invoking
          BULLETIN, and the user will get the same message as
          when invoking other commands not supported under ISPF
          (E.g. LOGON, ISPF, TEST).

          ==>   This should be done by an MVS systems programmer.

(  )  5.  Set the local variables at the beginning of the source
          in member BULLETIN.  Comments explaining the variables
          are further up in the source.  Your new system bulletin
          dataset will be initialized in the next step.

(  )  6.  Allocate an input dataset to match the name selected in
          the previous step.  Attributes should be DSORG=FB,
          LRECL=80, RECFM=PS.  Sample input data is in member
          BUINPUT.  Copy the data into the new input dataset.  If
          you use a name other than 'SYS1.BULLETIN.DATA':

          A.  Change the name in member BUSTCDTA, which is the
              input to the STC.
          B.  Change the name in member #BULLETI, which is the
              HELP member.

(  )  7.  The STC distributed in member BUSTC must be installed
          in a proclib available to JES.  If you choose to use a
          library for the input data (member BUSTCDTA) other than
          SYST.PROCLIB, edit the name in member BUSTC.

(  )  8.  For a non-SMP install, run the jobstream in member
          BUJCL of this PDS.  Recommended load libraries are:

          A.  SYS1.LINKLIB
          B.  SYS1.CMDLIB
          C.  library named on the LNKLST

          Note: For the bulletin command, this library must be
                APF authorized.  Unless LPALIB is on the APF
                list, BULLETIN will not run from LPALIB.

          Note: For MVS/370, LINKLIB and the libraries on the
                LNKLST are APF authorized, whether or not they
                are on the APF list.  This is not true for
                MVS/XA.

          Add a JOB card at the top, and edit the last few lines
          to provide the name of the selected load library, HELP
          library, PROC library, and the name of this PDS.

          The jobstream does the following:

          A.  Assembles BULLETIN using the source in member
              BULLETIN of this PDS.

              Note: Access to SYS1.AMODGEN is required because
                    BULLETIN uses the CVT macro.

          B.  Linkedits BULLETIN into the selected load library.
              Attributes are RENT, REUS, REFR, and AC=1.

              Note:  If an installation-provided SVC will be used
                     for authorization, change the control card
                     in member BULNK to AC(0)

          C.  IEBCOPYs member #BULLETI to the selected HELP
              library, renaming it to BULLETIN.

(  )      For an SMP install, follow your installation's procedures
          for installation of a RENT, REUS, REFR, AC=1 module into
          LPALIB, LINKLIB, CMDLIB, or another library on the
          LNKLST, with the HELP member being installed as a
          ++MAC into HELP or another library in the SYSHELP
          concatenation.

(  )  9.  If you have Dynamic BLDL, and already have a version
          of BULLETIN installed, you will have to stop and restart
          the Dynamic BLDL table.

(  ) 10.  If you have ACF2 and are using command limiting lists,
          and are not already running a version of BULLETIN, you
          must do either one of the following:

          A.  Remove the TSOCMDS entry from the LOGONID of selected
              users.  Do this from the READY state by typing in:

                   ACF
                   LIST logonid
                   CHANGE * TSOCMDS()
                   END

              Note:  Setting the ALLCMDS bit will not enable you
                     to test BULLETIN, since the command has an
                     eight character name.  ALLCMDS is limited to
                     seven characters because the 'command list
                     bypass character,' usually #, must be added
                     to the command name.  When added to an eight
                     character name, the resulting string of nine
                     characters will not be recognized as a
                     command by the terminal monitor program
                     (TMP).

          B.  Add the following macro to the command limiting
              list, then assemble, link, and IPL with CLPA.  This
              makes BULLETIN available to everyone.

                   $TSOCMD  (BULLETIN)

(  ) 11.  Add the following automatic command to your system.  In
          the example below, at 3:00 a.m. the started task in
          proclib member BULLETIN (distributed in member BUSTC)
          uses the input in proclib member BULLET01 (distributed
          in member BUSTCDTA) to execute BULLETIN command.

             $TA,T=03.00,'$VS,''START BULLETIN'''
