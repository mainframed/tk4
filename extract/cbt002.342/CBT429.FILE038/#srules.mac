RULES ADAPTED FROM A GAME "SUPER STAR TREK,"  WRITTEN BY  DAVID MATUSZEK
AND  PAUL REYNOLDS,  REWRITTEN FOR THE HARRIS 220 AT PENN STATE
UNIVERSITY BY ROD HILLS AND EXTENDED BY JOHN MCLAUGHLIN.
.sk
NO PORTION OF THE CODE FROM SUPER STAR TREK WAS USED IN WRITING KLINGON.
.sk
PERMISSION IS HEREBY GRANTED FOR THE COPYING, DISTRIBUTION, MODIFICATION
AND USE OF THIS PROGRAM AND ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTATION FOR RECREATIONAL
PURPOSES, PROVIDED THAT ALL REFERENCES TO THE AUTHOR ARE RETAINED.
HOWEVER, PERMISSION IS NOT AND WILL NOT BE GRANTED FOR THE SALE OR
PROMOTIONAL USE OF THIS PROGRAM OR PROGRAM DOCUMENTATION, OR FOR USE IN
ANY SITUATION IN WHICH PROFIT MAY BE CONSIDERED AN OBJECTIVE, SINCE IT
IS THE DESIRE OF THE AUTHOR TO RESPECT THE COPYRIGHTS OF THE ORIGINATORS
OF STAR TREK.
.pa
THE ORGANIAN PEACE TREATY HAS COLLAPSED, AND THE FEDERATION IS AT WAR
WITH THE KLINGON EMPIRE,  AND YOU ARE THE COMMANDER OF THE FLAGSHIP OF
THE KLINGON EMPIRE: THE SUPERCOMMANDER KAZH, THE MIGHEST SHIP IN THE
KNOWN GALAXY.
.sk
YOUR BATTLEGROUND IS FEDERATION SPACE, WHICH FOR CONVENIENCE IS DIVIDED
UP INTO EIGHT ROWS OF EIGHT QUADRANTS EACH, LIKE A CHECKERBOARD.  ROWS
ARE NUMBERED FROM TOP TO BOTTOM, AND COLUMNS ARE NUMBERED LEFT TO RIGHT,
SO QUADRANT 1 - 8 WOULD BE IN THE UPPER RIGHT HAND CORNER OF THE GALAXY.
.sk
DURING BATTLE YOU WILL BE CONCERNED ONLY WITH THOSE ENEMIES, THAT IS TO
SAY, FEDERATION STARBASES, AND FEDERATION STARSHIPS, THAT OCCUPY THE
SAME QUADRANT AS YOURSELF.  QUADRANTS ARE DIVIDED UP INTO SECTORS, TEN
ROWS OF TEN SECTORS EACH.  SECTORS ARE NUMBERED IN THE SAME WAY AS
QUADRANTS, SO THE SECTOR IN THE UPPER RIGHT CORNER IS SECTOR 1 - 10.
YOU HAVE A SHORT-RANGE SCANNER WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO LOOK AT THE ENTIRE
QUADRANT IN A SINGLE DISPLAY.
.sk
ENEMIES RECHARGE DURING YOUR ABSENCE.  IF YOU LEAVE A QUADRANT
CONTAINING A WEAKENED ENEMY, WHEN YOU RETURN TO THAT QUADRANT HE WILL BE
STRONG AGAIN.  ALSO, EACH TIME YOU ENTER A QUADRANT, THE POSITIONS OF
EVERYTHING IN THE QUADRANT (EXCEPT YOUR SHIP) ARE RANDOMIZED, TO SAVE
YOU THE TROUBLE OF TRYING TO REMEMBER WHERE EVERYTHING IN THE QUADRANT
IS.  NOTICE THAT THIS REFERS ONLY TO THE POSITIONS OF THINGS IN THE
QUADRANT--THE NUMBERS OF EACH KIND OF THING ARE NOT CHANGED (EXCEPT
BLACK HOLES) IF YOU KILL SOMETHING, IT STAYS DEAD.
.sk
THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF KLINGONS-  COMMANDERS, AND YOURSELF, THE
SUPER-COMMANDER KAZH,  THE COMMANDERS ARE NOT QUITE A MATCH FOR A
FEDERATION STARSHIP, BUT THEY CAN DO QUITE A BIT OF DAMAGE.
.sk
YOUR SHIP CONTAINS THE MOST ADVANCED KLINGON ENGINEERING FEATURES,
INCLUDING A LONG RANGE TRACTOR BEAM, AN ANTI-PHOTON DEVICE, AND A
DILITHIUM RE-ENERGIZER THAT CAN REFOCUS ENERGY FROM YOUR MAIN ENERGY
CELLS, BACK INTO THE MATTER-ANTIMATTER CONVERTERS TO CREATE ENERGY AT A
RATE OF 1024 UNITS/STARDATES, RECHARGING YOUR SHIP.  THIS RECHARGING IS
ESSENTIAL TO YOUR POSSIBILITY OF SUCCESS FOR YOU AND YOUR STRIKE FORCE,
SINCE HOME IS TWO WEEKS AWAY, AND YOU CAN'T STOP ANYPLACE FOR ENERGY.
.sk
THERE IS YET ANOTHER PROBLEM, TOO, YOU DON'T HAVE THE ELEMENT OF
SURPRISE FOREVER, YOU MUST BREAK THROUGH THE FEDERATION DEFENSES, AND
DESTROY ALL STARBASES BEFORE THE FEDERATION HAS TIME TO MUSTER A DEFENSE
TO YOUR STRIKE FORCE, IN ABOUT 7 STARDATES.
.sk
IN LIGHT OF THIS ENERGY SHORTAGE, YOUR SHIP IS NOT EQUIPPED WITH ANY
KIND OF ENERGY WEAPONS, SUCH AS PHASERS, BUT INSTEAD IS EQUIPPED WITH
ULTRA HIGH POWER DISRUPTOR TORPEDOES, EACH CONTAINING OVER TEN GRAMS OF
ANTI-MATTER.
.sk
IF YOU SUCCEED IN YOUR MISSION, WHICH IS NOT AN EASY ONE, THEN MANY
RICHES OF THE GALAXY WILL BE YOURS, AND YOU WILL HAVE COMPLETE CONTROL
OVER ALL FEDERATION SPACE, MAKING THE GALAXY SAFE FOR TREACHERY FOREVER.
.pa
SPACE IS VAST, AND IT TAKES PRECIOUS TIME TO MOVE FROM ONE PLACE TO
ANOTHER.  IN COMPARISON, OTHER THINGS HAPPEN SO QUICKLY THAT WE ASSUME
THEY TAKE NO TIME AT ALL.  TWO WAYS THAT TIME CAN PASS ARE WHEN YOU
MOVE, OR WHEN YOU ISSUE A COMMAND TO SIT STILL AND REST FOR A PERIOD OF
TIME.  YOU WILL SOMETIMES WANT TO DO THE LATTER, SINCE THE VARIOUS
DEVICES ABOARD YOUR STARSHIP MAY BE DAMAGED AND REQUIRE TIME TO REPAIR.
.sk
IN ADDITION TO STARSHIPS AND STARBASES, THE GALAXY CONTAINS (SURPRISE)
STARS.  MOSTLY, STARS ARE A NUISANCE AND JUST GET IN YOUR WAY.  HOWEVER,
STARS CAN BE VERY USEFUL WHEN NEXT TO AN INTENDED TARGET, AS THEY CAN
THEN BE MADE TO GO NOVA, CAUSING HEAVY DAMAGE TO ANY NEARBY SHIPS OR
STARBASES.  IF ANOTHER STAR IS ADJACENT TO A NOVA, IT TOO WILL GO NOVA.
STARS MAY ALSO OCCASIONALLY GO SUPERNOVA; A SUPERNOVA IN A QUADRANT
DESTROYS EVERYTHING IN THE QUADRANT AND MAKES THE QUADRANT PERMANENTLY
UNINHABITABLE.  YOU MAY 'JUMP OVER' A QUADRANT CONTAINING A SUPERNOVA
WHEN YOU MOVE, BUT YOU SHOULD NOT STOP THERE.
.sk
SUPERNOVAS ARE A RARE NATURAL EVENT, THE MOST LIKELY WAY FOR A STAR TO
GO SUPERNOVA IS FOR ONE OF YOUR DISRUPTOR TORPEDOES TO SET IT OFF.  IN
THE EVENT YOU DO SET OFF A STAR (10%) AND IT GOES SUPERNOVA,
NAVIGATIONAL CONTROL OF YOUR SHIP WILL BE TAKEN OVER BY YOUR BATTLE
COMPUTER, AND YOU WILL BE PILOTED OUT OF THE QUADRANT, PICKING AS A
TARGET QUADRANT, ONE OF THE FOLLOWING: (IN ORDER OF PREFERENCE)
.sk
.in 5
1.  THE NEAREST QUADRANT THAT DOES NOT CONTAIN AN ENEMY STARBASE OR
STARSHIP.
.sk
2.  A QUADRANT SLIGHTLY MORE DISTANT THAT DOES NOT CONTAIN AN ENEMY.
.sk
3.  THE NEAREST QUADRANT TO WHICH THE PATH IS CLEAR.
.sk
4.  ANY QUADRANT TO WHICH YOU CAN MOVE.
.in 0
.sk
IF YOUR BATTLE COMPUTER IS DAMAGED, YOU WILL BE GIVEN A RANDOM COURSE TO
A RANDOM NEARBY QUADRANT.
.sk
ALSO A FEW PLANETS ARE SCATTERED THROUGH THE GALAXY.  THESE CAN BE VERY
HELPFUL, AND YOU GET TIME BONUS (WHICH CAN BE TURNED INTO ENERGY BY
RESTING, WHICH INCREASES YOUR ENERGY SUPPLY) DEPENDING ON THE BILLIONS
OF PEOPLE KILLED AND WHETHER THE PLANET HAD DILITHIUM WHEN YOU BLOW UP
THESE PLANETS.  PLANETS CAN BE DETECTED ON THE LONG RANGE SCANNERS.
.sk
FINALLY, EACH QUADRANT WILL CONTAIN FROM 0 TO 3 BLACK HOLES.  THESE CAN
SWALLOW TORPEDOES PASSING NEAR THEM.  THEY ARE JUST SOMETHING TO GET IN
YOUR WAY, AND SERVE NO USEFUL PURPOSE.

           ----------HOW TO ISSUE COMMANDS----------
.fo on
.sk
(IBM 327X TSO USERS SHOULD SEE "APPENDIX T - NOTES FOR FULL SCREEN
USERS") WHEN THE GAME IS WAITING FOR YOU TO ENTER A COMMAND, IT WILL
PRINT OUT
.sk
.fo off
           COMMAND - ?
.fo on
.sk
YOU MAY THEN TYPE IN YOUR COMMAND.  ALL YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER FOR EACH
COMMAND IS THE MNEMONIC.  FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU WANT TO MOVE STRAIGHT UP
FOR ONE QUADRANT, YOU CAN TYPE IN THE MNEMONIC "MOVE"
.sk
AND THE COMPUTER WILL PROMPT YOU WITH
.sk
.fo off
           MANUAL OR AUTOMATIC?
.fo on
.sk
SAY YOU TYPE IN 'MANUAL'.  THE COMPUTER THEN RESPONDS
.sk
.fo off
           X AND Y DISPLACEMENTS-
.fo on
.sk
NOW YOU TYPE IN 0 1 WHICH SPECIFIES AN X MOVEMENT OF ZERO AND A Y
MOVEMENT OF 1.
.sk
WHEN YOU HAVE LEARNED THE COMMANDS, YOU CAN AVOID BEING PROMPTED BY
SIMPLY TYPING IN THE INFORMATION WITHOUT WAITING TO BE ASKED FOR IT.
FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE ABOVE EXAMPLE, YOU COULD SIMPLY TYPE IN
.sk
.fo off
           MOVE MANUAL 0 1
.fo on
.sk
AND IT WILL BE DONE.  OR YOU COULD TYPE IN
.fo off

.sk
.fo on
AND WHEN THE COMPUTER RESPONDS WITH

.sk
YOU CAN TYPE IN
.fo off

SUCCESSFULLY.  FOR YOUR SAFETY, CERTAIN CRITICAL COMMANDS (SUCH AS TO
TERMINATE) MUST BE WRITTEN OUT IN FULL.  ALSO, IN A FEW CASES TWO OR
MORE COMMANDS BEGIN WITH THE SAME LETTER, AND IN THIS CASE THAT LETTER
REFERS TO A PARTICULAR ONE OF THE COMMANDS; TO GET THE OTHER, YOUR
ABBREVIATION MUST BE TWO OR MORE LETTERS LONG.  THIS SOUNDS COMPLICATED,
BUT YOU WILL LEARN THE ABBREVIATIONS QUICKLY ENOUGH.
.sk
WHAT THIS ALL BOILS DOWN TO IS-
.sk
.in 5
(1) YOU CAN ABBREVIATE PRACTICALLY ANYTHING,
.sk
(2) IF YOU FORGET, THE COMPUTER WILL PROMPT YOU,
.sk
(3) IF YOU REMEMBER, YOU CAN TYPE IT ALL ON ONE LINE.
.sk
.in 0
IF YOU ARE PART WAY THROUGH ENTERING A COMMAND AND YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND,
YOU CAN CANCEL THE COMMAND BY TYPING A -1 AS ONE OF THE PARAMETERS, WITH
THE EXCEPTION OF THE MANUAL MOVE COMMAND (TYPE X AND Y OF 0 0 TO CANCEL
A MOVE MANUAL.)
.sk
IF ANYTHING IS NOT CLEAR TO YOU, EXPERIMENT.  THE WORST YOU CAN DO IS
LOSE A GAME OR TWO.

  FULL COMMAND-  ANTI PHOTON
.sk
.fo on
LIKE ALL KLINGON COMMANDERS, YOUR SHIP IS EQUIPPED WITH AN ANTI-PHOTON
DEVICE.  THIS A.P.D.  WILL PROTECT YOU FROM ONE ROUND OF FEDERATION
PHOTON TORPEDOES (3.)  THE A.P.D.  REQUIRES 500 UNITS OF SHIELD ENERGY
TO ACTIVATE IT.  TWO THINGS CAN DISARM THE ANTI-PHOTON DEVICE, 1.  IT
ABSORBS A FULL ROUND OF TORPEDOES OR  2.  A FEDERATION STARSHIP FIRES
PHASERS AT YOU (THE A.P.D. IS RUN BY THE SHIP'S MAIN COMPUTER, NOT THE
BATTLE COMPUTER, AND AS SUCH IS NOT AFFECTED WHEN THE BATTLE COMPUTER IS
DAMAGED AND CAN BE USED EVEN IF YOUR SHIELDS ARE DOWN.)
.sk
THE USE OF THE ANTI PHOTON DEVICE DOES NOT COUNT AS A TURN AND CAN BE
ACTIVATED INSTANTLY, EVEN DURING BATTLE, AT NO COST IN TIME, AND DOES
NOT ALLOW ENEMIES TO ATTACK.
.pa

.sk
MNEMONIC- BATTERY
SHORTEST ABBREVIATION- BATT
.sk
.fo on
THE BATTERY COMMAND PROVIDES INFORMATION OF WHETHER YOUR BATTERIES (USED
IF YOU FALL BELOW ZERO ENERGY) ARE CHARGED OR NOT, ONCE THE BATTERIES
ARE DRAINED THERE IS NO WAY TO RECHARGE THEM.  THEY CONTAIN 750.0 UNITS
OF ENERGY.
.pa

.sk
    MNEMONIC-  CHART
    SHORTEST ABBREVIATION-  C
.sk
.fo on
AS YOU PROCEED IN THE GAME, YOU LEARN MORE AND MORE ABOUT WHAT THINGS
ARE WHERE IN THE GALAXY.  THIS INFORMATION IS AUTOMATICALLY RECORDED FOR
YOU IN YOUR STAR CHART.
.sk
THE CHART LOOKS LIKE AN 8 BY 8 ARRAY OF NUMBERS.  THESE NUMBERS ARE
INTERPRETED EXACTLY AS THEY ARE ON A LONG-RANGE SCAN.  A PERIOD (.) IN
PLACE OF A DIGIT MEANS YOU DO NOT KNOW THAT INFORMATION YET.  FOR
EXAMPLE, ... MEANS YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THE QUADRANT.

LOOKING AT THE STAR CHART IS A FREE OPERATION.  IT COSTS YOU NEITHER
TIME NOR ENERGY, AND CAN BE DONE SAFELY WHETHER IN OR OUT OF BATTLE.

THE SHIP'S COMPUTER ALLOWS YOU TO GET SOME INFORMATION ABOUT MOVEMENT,
BEFORE YOU ACTUALLY MOVE.  YOU ENTER THE DESTINATION YOU ARE CONSIDERING
IN THE SAME FORMAT AS MOVE . THE COMPUTER WILL THEN CALCULATE AND REPORT
TO YOU THE TIME AND ENERGY REQUIRED FOR SUCH A TRIP.

THIS COMMAND REQUIRES NO TIME OR ENERGY, SO YOU MAY USE IT ANYTIME YOUR
SHIP'S COMPUTER IS UNDAMAGED.

WHILE NOT A COMMAND, THIS SECTION IS TO DOCUMENT WHAT FUNCTIONS ARE
HANDLED BY THE "SHIP'S COMPUTER" WHICH IS IN THE HEART OF THE SHIP AND
NOT OPEN TO ATTACK, AND WHAT IS CONTROLLED BY THE "BATTLE COMPUTER"

    SHORTEST ABBREVIATION-  DA
.sk
.fo on
AT ANY TIME YOU MAY ASK FOR A DAMAGE REPORT TO FIND OUT WHAT DEVICES ARE
DAMAGED AND HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO REPAIR THEM.
.sk
IF YOU SUFFER DAMAGES AND MOVE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A SUBSEQUENT DAMAGE
REPORT WILL NOT SHOW ANY DAMAGE.  THIS HAPPENS IF THE TIME SPENT ON THE
MOVE EXCEEDS THE REPAIR TIME, SINCE IN THIS CASE THE DAMAGED DEVICES
WERE FIXED EN ROUTE.
.sk
DAMAGE REPORTS ARE FREE.  THEY USE NO ENERGY OR TIME, AND CAN BE DONE
SAFELY EVEN IN THE MIDST OF BATTLE.

                    SHIELDS TRANSFER (AMOUNT OF ENERGY TO TRANSFER)
.fo on
.sk
YOUR DEFLECTOR SHIELDS ARE A DEFENSIVE DEVICE TO PROTECT YOU FROM
FEDERATION ATTACKS (AND NEARBY NOVAS).  AS THE SHIELDS PROTECT YOU, THEY
GRADUALLY WEAKEN.  A SHIELD STRENGTH OF 75 PERCENT, FOR EXAMPLE, MEANS
THAT THE NEXT TIME YOU ARE ATTACKED, YOUR SHIELDS WILL DEFLECT 75
PERCENT OF THE HIT, AND LET 25 PERCENT GET THROUGH TO HURT YOU.
.sk
IT COSTS 50 UNITS OF ENERGY TO RAISE SHIELDS, NOTHING TO LOWER THEM.
.sk
YOU SHOULD NEVER HAVE TO RAISE OR LOWER SHIELDS MANUALLY, AS YOUR
AUTOMATIC DEFLECTOR SCREEN CONTROL WILL DO THIS FOR YOU, AS YOU GO INTO
BATTLE, AND LEAVE BATTLE.
.sk
YOU MAY TRANSFER ENERGY BETWEEN THE SHIP'S ENERGY (GIVEN AS (ENERGY) IN
STATUS) AND THE SHIELDS.  (TRANSFER) MAY BE ABBREVIATED (T).  (AMOUNT OF
ENERGY TO TRANSFER) IS THE NUMBER OF UNITS OF ENERGY YOU WISH TO TAKE
FROM THE SHIP'S ENERGY AND PUT INTO THE SHIELDS.  IF YOU SPECIFY A
NEGATIVE NUMBER, ENERGY IS DRAINED FROM THE SHIELDS TO THE SHIP.
TRANSFERRING ENERGY CONSTITUTES A TURN.  IF YOU TRANSFER ENERGY TO THE
SHIELDS WHILE UNDER ATTACK, THEY WILL BE AT THE NEW ENERGY LEVEL WHEN
YOU ARE NEXT HIT.
.sk
ENEMY TORPEDOES HITTING YOUR SHIP EXPLODE ON YOUR SHIELDS (IF THEY ARE
UP) AND HAVE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME EFFECT AS PHASER HITS.

************************
* DISRUPTOR TORPEDOES  *
************************
.sk
    MNEMONIC-  DISRUPTOR
    SHORTEST ABBREVIATION-  DIS
    FULL COMMANDS-  DISRUPTOR (NUMBER),(T1),(T2),(T3),(T4)
    (T1, T2... MEANS "TARGET NUMBER")
.sk
.fo on
DISRUPTOR TORPEDOES ARE PROJECTILE WEAPONS--YOU EITHER HIT WHAT YOU AIM
AT, OR YOU DON'T.  THERE ARE NO 'PARTIAL HITS'.
.sk
YOU MAY FIRE DISRUPTOR TORPEDOES SINGLY, OR IN BURSTS OF TWO THREE OR
FOUR.  EACH TORPEDO IS INDIVIDUALLY TARGETABLE.  THE COMPUTER WILL
PROMPT YOU, ASKING FOR THE TARGET SECTOR FOR EACH TORPEDO.  ALTERNATELY,
YOU MAY SPECIFY EACH TARGET IN THE COMMAND LINE.
.sk
IF MORE THAN ONE TORPEDO IS FIRED AND ONLY ONE TARGET SECTOR IS
SPECIFIED, ALL TORPEDOES ARE FIRED AT THAT SECTOR.  FOR EXAMPLE, TO FIRE
TWO TORPEDOES AT SECTOR 3 - 4, YOU TYPE
.sk
.fo off
    DIS 2 3 4           (OR)           DIS 2 3 4 3 4

      DIS 1 3 2.5
.fo on
.sk
TO AIM BETWEEN TWO SECTORS.  HOWEVER, SECTOR NUMBERS MUST BE 1 TO 10
INCLUSIVE.
.sk
TORPEDOES GOING WITHIN 0.5 SECTORS OF A BLACK HOLE ARE SWALLOWED.  IF
YOUR DISRUPTOR TORPEDO TUBES ARE DAMAGED LESS THAN 3 STARDATES, YOU CAN

THE PURPOSE OF THE (FREEZE) COMMAND IS TO ALLOW A PLAYER TO SAVE THE
CURRENT STATE OF THE GAME, SO THAT IT CAN BE FINISHED LATER.
ALL PERTINANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE GAME IS WRITTEN TO A FREEZE
FILE, SAVED ON THE USERS CATALOG, AND THE GAME STOPS.
.sk
TO RESTART A GAME CREATED BY THE 'FREEZE' COMMAND, THE USER NEED ONLY
TYPE 'OLD' IN RESPONSE TO THE INITIAL QUESTION ABOUT THE TYPE OF GAME
DESIRED, FOLLOWED BY THE (FILE NAME).
.sk
NOTE-  A 'TOURNAMENT' GAME IS LIKE A FROZEN GAME, WITH THE FOLLOWING
DIFFERENCES.  (1)  TOURNAMENT GAMES ALWAYS START FROM THE BEGINNING,
WHILE A FROZEN GAME CAN START AT ANY POINT.  (2)  TOURNAMENT GAMES
REQUIRE ONLY THAT THE PLAYER REMEMBER THE NAME OR NUMBER OF THE
TOURNAMENT, WHILE THE INFORMATION ABOUT A FROZEN GAME MUST BE KEPT ON A

THE IMPULSE ENGINES GIVE YOU A WAY TO MOVE WHEN YOUR WARP ENGINES ARE
DAMAGED.  THEY MOVE YOU AT A SPEED OF 0.95 SECTORS PER STARDATE, WHICH

SLOW TO USE EXCEPT IN EMERGENCIES.
.sk
MOVEMENT COMMANDS ARE INDICATED JUST AS IN THE 'MOVE' COMMAND.

FOR EXAMPLE, IN YOUR QUADRANT (1 - 4) THE NUMBER IS 2, WHICH INDICATES 2
STARS, YOU, AND NOTHING ELSE (YOU ARE ALWAYS IN THE CENTER QUADRANT OF
THESE SCANS.)  THERE IS A FEDERATION STARSHIP IN QUADRANT 1 - 3 (102), A
COMMANDER AND SEVEN STARS IN QUADRANT 2 - 3 (1007), A SUPERNOVA IN
QUADRANT 1 - 5 (9999) AND A STARBASE, AND NINE STARS IN 2 - 5 (19)

YOU MIGHT ALSO NOTICE A REPORT ON A PLANET IN QUADRANT 2 - 5 UNLIKE
SUPER STAR TREK, PLANETS ARE DETECTABLE BY LONG RANGE SCAN, SO THAT IF
THEY ARE IN YOUR FLIGHT PATH, YOU CAN STOP AND KILL IT IF YOU WISH.

AND IT WILL BE DONE.  IN AUTOMATIC MODE, EITHER TWO OR FOUR NUMBERS MUST
BE SUPPLIED.
.sk
AUTOMATIC MODE UTILIZES THE SHIP'S 'BATTLE COMPUTER'.  IF THE COMPUTER
IS DAMAGED, MANUAL MOVEMENT MUST BE USED.
.sk
IF WARP ENGINES ARE DAMAGED LESS THAN 5 STARDATES YOU CAN STILL GO WARP
FIVE.
.sk
IT USES TIME AND ENERGY TO MOVE.  HOW MUCH TIME AND HOW MUCH ENERGY
DEPENDS ON YOUR CURRENT WARP FACTOR AND THE DISTANCE YOU MOVE.  THE
HIGHER THE WARP FACTOR, THE FASTER YOU MOVE, AND THE MORE ENERGY YOU
USE, BUT THE WARP ENGINES ARE MORE EFFICIENT AT HIGH SPEEDS.
.sk
IN OTHER WORDS, TO GET THERE TWICE AS FAST DOES NOT USE TWICE AS MUCH
ENERGY.
.sk
THE SUGGESTED WARP SPEED IS WARP 10, THE FASTEST "SAFE" SPEED.

THE TRACTOR COMMAND ALLOWS YOU TO PULL A SHIP ACROSS SOME DISTANCE IN
SPACE.  WHEN THIS COMMAND IS ISSUED YOU WILL BE PROMPTED WITH THE AMOUNT
OF ENERGY IT WOULD TAKE TO PULL A SHIP THAT FAR, AND ASKED IF YOU STILL
WISH TO ENGAGE THE TRACTOR BEAM,  IF A SHIP IS FOUND AT THE TARGET
QUADRANT IT WILL BE PULLED TO YOUR QUADRANT.  IF THERE IS MORE THAN ONE
AT THE TARGET QUADRANT, ONE WILL BE SELECTED RANDOMLY.
.sk
IF THERE IS NO SHIP AT THE TARGET QUADRANT, YOU WILL BE NOTIFIED OF THIS
FACT, AND THE POWER DRAIN CAUSED BY THE TRACTOR BEAM WILL BE CUT BY 50%
.sk
IT IS POSSIBLE TO TRACTOR EITHER COMMANDERS (TO HELP OUT IN A FIGHT
PERHAPS)  OR FEDERATION STARSHIPS,  STARBASES, PLANETS, STARS, AND BLACK
HOLES ARE NOT EFFECTED BY THE TRACTORS.

YOUR WARP FACTOR CONTROLS THE SPEED OF YOUR STARSHIP.  THE LARGER THE
WARP FACTOR, THE FASTER YOU GO AND THE MORE ENERGY YOU USE.
.sk
YOUR MINIMUM WARP FACTOR IS 1.0 AND YOUR MAXIMUM WARP FACTOR IS 12.0.
AT SPEEDS ABOVE WARP 10 THERE IS SOME DANGER OF CAUSING DAMAGE TO YOUR
WARP ENGINES; THIS DAMAGE IS LARGER AT HIGHER WARP FACTORS AND ALSO
DEPENDS ON HOW FAR YOU GO AT THAT WARP FACTOR.

.fo on
.sk
IF A FEDERATION STARBASE OR PLANET IS ATTACKED, BUT NOT DESTROYED (AND
THERE IS ANYONE ALIVE TO DO IT,)  A SUBSPACE RADIO CALL ON THE STAR
FLEET PRIORITY ONE CHANNEL WILL GO OUT, MEANING THAT IF THERE ARE ANY
FEDERATION STARSHIPS NEARBY, YOU WILL SOON HAVE LOTS OF COMPANY...
.sk
BLACK HOLES MOVE ABOUT, RANDOMLY.
.sk
THE TYPE OF DISRUPTOR TORPEDOES YOU CARRY HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO EXPLODE IN
THE FIRING TUBE, BUT THAT IS RATHER RARE.
.sk
WHEN HITS ARE SHOT AT THE SUPPERCOMMANDER KAZH, THE HIT IS SHOWN AS TWO
NUMBERS, EXAMPLE:
.sk
.fo off
(112,1832)  UNIT HIT FROM FEDERATION STARSHIP AT 1 - 1

SCORING IS FAIRLY SIMPLE.  YOU GET POINTS FOR GOOD THINGS, AND YOU LOSE
POINTS FOR BAD THINGS.
.sk
.fo off
YOU GAIN--
.sk
   (1)  200 POINTS FOR EACH FEDERATION STARBASE
   (2)  100 POINTS FOR EACH FEDERATION STARSHIP YOU DESTROY
   (3)  YOU GET A WIN BONUS BASED ON YOUR SKILL LEVEL,
        10000-GOOD, 20000-EXPERT, 30000-EMERITUS
   (4)  A SPECIAL WIN BONUS FOR TIME REMAINING.
   (5)  A PROMOTION TO THE NEXT LEVEL, FOR ANY WIN.
   (6)  A POINT BONUS FOR BILLIONS OF PEOPLE KILLED
        ON PLANETS, AND AN EXTRA BONUS FOR DILITHIUM.
.sk
YOU LOSE:
.sk
   (7)  75 POINTS FOR EACH COMMANDER DESTROYED.
   (8)  1000 POINTS IF YOU GET YOURSELF KILLED.
.sk
.fo on
YOU CAN BE PROMOTED FROM ANY LEVEL.  THERE IS A SPECIAL PROMOTION
AVAILABLE IF YOU GO BEYOND THE 'EXPERT' RANGE.  YOU CAN ALSO HAVE A
CERTIFICATE OF MERIT PRINTED WITH YOUR NAME, AND DATE PROVIDED YOU ARE
PROMOTED FROM EITHER THE 'EXPERT' OR 'EMERITUS' LEVELS.
.sk
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY START OUT AT THE GOOD LEVEL, EVEN IF YOU ARE ALREADY
FAMILIAR WITH ONE OF THE OTHER VERSIONS OF THE STAR TREK GAME--BUT, OF
COURSE, THE LEVEL OF GAME YOU PLAY IS UP TO YOU.  IF YOU WANT TO START
AT THE EXPERT LEVEL, GO AHEAD.  IT'S YOUR FUNERAL.  THE EMERITUS GAME IS
CONSIDERED IMPOSSIBLE BY SOME (ALTHOUGH IT IS RUMORED THAT THE AUTHOR
WINS ABOUT 10 PERCENT OF THE TIME)

COURSES ARE GIVEN IN MANUAL MODE IN X - Y DISPLACEMENTS; IN AUTOMATIC
MODE AS DESTINATION QUADRANT AND/OR SECTOR.  DISTANCES ARE GIVEN IN
QUADRANTS.  A DISTANCE OF ONE SECTOR IS 0.1 QUADRANT.  STARBASES REQUIRE
4 TO 6 TORPEDOES TO KILL, WHILE A FEDERATION REQUIRES 2-4 TORPEDOES TO
KILL,  AND PLANETS ANYWHERE FROM 1-4 TORPEDOES DEPENDING ON POPULATION
AND PRESENCE OF DILITHIUM.

WARP 10 IS THE FASTEST SAFE SPEED.  AT HIGHER SPEEDS, ENGINE DAMAGE MAY

.sk
For TSO 3270 users, KLINGON is a full screen application.  the major
differences are:
.sk
The SRSCAN, LRSCAN, and STATUS commands cannot be explictly entered,
since this information is on the screen at all times.
.sk
The format of the screen is:
.sk 2
.fo off
    ...........  ++++++++++   LRSCAN
    ...........  ++++++++++   and
    ... SRS ...  + status +
    ...........  ++ info ++   PLANET
    ...........  ++++++++++   info
.fo on
.sk
SRS and STATUS - the format of this information is the same as the
standard version.
.sk
The LRSCAN and PLANET information is the same as described in the LRSCAN
command, however, the information is presented in a "compressed" form,
to allow for the smaller amount of space available on the screen
.sk
The full screen mode will work only on 24 and 43 line 327X devices.
.sk
If you wish to experiment with other devices, the FSIO1 assembler
routine supplied in source must be modified by the user.
