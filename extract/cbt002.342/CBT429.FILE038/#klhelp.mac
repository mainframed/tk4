MOVE          THIS COMMAND IS THE USUAL WAY TO MOVE FROM ONE PLACE TO
MOVE        ANOTHER WITHIN THE GALAXY. YOU MOVE UNDER WARP DRIVE, ACCORD
MOVE        TO THE CURRENT WARP FACTOR (SEE 'WARP FACTOR').
MOVE          THERE ARE TWO COMMAND MODES FOR MOVEMENT; MANUAL AND AUTOM

MOVE
MOVE        WHERE (QROW) AND (QCOL) ARE THE ROW AND COLUMN NUMBERS OF TH
MOVE        DESTINATION QUADRANT, AND (SROW) AND (SCOL) ARE THE ROW AND
MOVE        COLUMN NUMBERS OF THE DESTINATION SECTOR WITHIN THAT QUADRAN
MOVE        THIS COMMAND ALSO MOVES YOUR SHIP IN A STRAIGHT LINE PATH TO
MOVE        THE DESTINATION. FOR MOVING WITHIN A QUADRANT, (QROW) AND
MOVE
MOVE        (QCOL) MAY BE OMITTED. FOR EXAMPLE, TO MOVE TO SECTOR 2 - 9
MOVE        IN THE CURRENT QUADRANT, THE SHORTEST COMMAND WOULD BE

MOVE
MOVE        TO MOVE TO QUADRANT 3 - 7, SECTOR 5 - 8, TYPE
MOVE

MOVE
MOVE        AND IT WILL BE DONE. IN AUTOMATIC MODE, EITHER TWO OR FOUR N
MOVE        MUST BE SUPPLIED.
MOVE
MOVE          AUTOMATIC MODE UTILIZES THE SHIP'S 'BATTLE COMPUTER'.  IF
MOVE        THE COMPUTER IS DAMAGED, MANUAL MOVEMENT MUST BE USED.
MOVE
MOVE          IF WARP ENGINES ARE DAMAGED LESS THAN 5 STARDATES
MOVE        YOU CAN STILL GO WARP 5.
MOVE          IT USES TIME AND ENERGY TO MOVE.  HOW MUCH TIME AND HOW MU
MOVE        ENERGY DEPENDS ON YOUR CURRENT WARP FACTOR AND THE DISTANCE
MOVE        MOVE THE HIGHER THE WARP FACTOR, THE
MOVE        FASTER YOU MOVE, BUT HIGHER WARP FACTORS REQUIRE MORE ENERGY
MOVE        YOUR WARP ENGINES ARE MOST EFFICIENT AT WARP FACTOR 10,
MOVE        AS YOU MOVE AWAY FROM THIS SPEED, YOU USE MORE ENERGY
MOVE        IN PROPORTION TO THE DISTANCE MOVED.

SHIELDS     (T). (AMOUNT OF ENERGY TO TRANSFER) IS THE NUMBER OF UNITS O
SHIELDS     ENERGY YOU WISH TO TAKE FROM THE SHIP'S ENERGY AND PUT INTO
SHIELDS     SHIELDS. IF YOU SPECIFY A NEGATIVE NUMBER, ENERGY IS DRAINED
SHIELDS     FROM THE SHIELDS TO THE SHIP. TRANSFERRING ENERGY CONSTITUTE
SHIELDS     TURN. IF YOU TRANSFER ENERGY TO THE SHIELDS WHILE UNDER ATTA
SHIELDS     THEY WILL BE AT THE NEW ENERGY LEVEL WHEN YOU ARE NEXT HIT.

SHIELDS       ENEMY TORPEDOES HITTING YOUR SHIP EXPLODE ON YOUR SHIELDS
SHIELDS     (IF THEY ARE UP) AND HAVE ESSENTIALLY THE SAME EFFECT AS PHA
SHIELDS     HITS.

SHIELDS     IF YOU WISH TO OVERRIDE AUTOMATIC SHIELD CONTROL, SPECIFY
SHIELDS     "UP" OR "DOWN" IN THE COMMAND.

DISRUPTOR   WILL PROMPT YOU, ASKING FOR THE TARGET SECTOR FOR EACH TORPE
DISRUPTOR   ALTERNATELY, YOU MAY SPECIFY EACH TARGET IN THE COMMAND LINE
DISRUPTOR
DISRUPTOR     IF MORE THAN ONE TORPEDO IS FIRED AND ONLY ONE TARGET
DISRUPTOR   SECTOR IS SPECIFIED, ALL TORPEDOES ARE FIRED AT THAT SECTOR.

FS3270                 Notes for TSO 3270 users
FS3270                 ========================
FS3270
FS3270      For TSO 3270 users, KLINGON is a full screen application.
FS3270      the major differences are:
FS3270
FS3270      The SRSCAN, LRSCAN, and STATUS commands cannot be
FS3270      explictly entered, since this information is on the screen
FS3270      at all times.
FS3270
FS3270      The format of the screen is:
FS3270
FS3270
FS3270
FS3270          ...........  ++++++++++   LRSCAN
FS3270          ...........  ++++++++++   and
FS3270          ... SRS ...  + status +
FS3270          ...........  ++ info ++   PLANET
FS3270          ...........  ++++++++++   info
FS3270
FS3270      SRS and STATUS - the format of this information is the
FS3270      same as the standard version.
FS3270
FS3270      The LRSCAN and PLANET information is the same as described
FS3270      in the LRSCAN command, however, the information is presented
FS3270      in a "compressed" form, to allow for the smaller amount of
FS3270      space available on the screen
FS3270
FS3270      The full screen mode will work only on 24 and 43 line 327X
FS3270      devices.
FS3270
FS3270      If you wish to experiment with other devices, the FSIO1
FS3270      assembler routine supplied in source must be modified by
FS3270      the user.
