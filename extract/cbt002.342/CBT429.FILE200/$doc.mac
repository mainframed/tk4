                     IT REQUIRES ABOUT 2.5 MEGABYTE OF DISK STORAGE
                     TO HOLD THE PDS (1 3350 CYLINDER AT 80 X 19040).

                     ONCE THE PDS HAS BEEN CREATED ON YOUR SYSTEM THE 5
                     PROGRAMS MAY BE RECOMPILED.  ALL OF THE PROGRAMS
                     EXCEPT XREF2 ARE WRITTEN IN OS/VS ASSEMBLER
                     LANGUAGE.  THE PRIVATE MACROS UTILIZED WITHIN THE
