//***FILE 200 is from TWA and contains the following programs:      *
//*                                                                 *
//*    Most of these programs were written by Rex Widmer and/or     *
//*    Peter Farrell.                                               *
//*                                                                 *
//*    Some fixes were made by Roland Schiradin and Sam Golob.      *
//*    These were just so the programs would work.  The COBOL       *
//*    load module programs still need modernization.               *
//*                                                                 *
//*    WHATSNEW  THIS PROGRAM ANALYZES A PDS AND LISTS              *
//*              THE MEMBERS IN MOST RECENTLY CHANGED ORDER         *
//*              A CHANGE IS CONSTITUTED TO MEAN A RE-LINKEDIT,     *
//*              OR A CHANGE BY SUPERZAP.  IT IS DRIVEN BY THE      *
//*              IDR DATA RECORDS WITHIN THE PDS.                   *
//*                                                                 *
//*              (Program updated for DFSORT Release 13.0 and       *
//*              OS/390 Rel 2.6.  OLD VERSION STILL INCLUDED.)      *
//*                                                                 *
//*              This version needs Y2D sort parameter to be        *
//*              supported.                                         *
//*                                                                 *
//*    WHEREUSD  THIS PROGRAM ANALYZES A PDS AND LISTS ALL MEMBERS  *
//*              WHICH CONTAIN A REFERENCE TO A GIVEN EXTERNAL      *

//*              Updated for Y2K - Format dates in header of the    *
//*                                report.                          *

//*    COMPARE   THIS PROGRAM ANALYZES GIVEN MEMBERS WHICH EXIST IN *
//*              A PAIR OF PDS'S.  THE MEMBERS ARE CHECKED FOR      *
//*              DIFFERENCES AND FOR ADHERENCE TO INSTALLATION      *
//*              STANDARDS AS A PRE-IMPLEMENTATION Q/C MEASURE.     *
//*                                                                 *
//*    COBREAD   THIS PROGRAM ANALYZES A PDS AND LISTS ALL MEMBERS  *
//*              ALONG WITH THE COBOL ATTRIBUTES ASSOCIATED WITH    *
//*              THE MAIN CSECT WITHIN THE MODULE.  SUCH ITEMS AS   *
//*              COBOL / STATE / / FLOW / / OPTIMIZATION / /TEST/,  *
//*              / ENDJOB /,  AND  / DYNAM / ARE LISTED.            *
//*              THE ABILITY TO SELECTIVELY ANALYZE A SINGLE        *
//*              MEMBER IS ALSO SUPPORTED.                          *
//*                                                                 *
//*              I would suggest running COBANAL from File 321.     *
//*              That's a more modern program, which does the job   *
//*              better.   (SBG 03/00)                              *

//*              This program must be linkedited AMODE 31 or ANY.   *

//*    XREF1     THIS PROGRAM SCANS A PDS AND PRODUCES INTERMEDIATE *
//*              RECORDS TO ALLOW XREF2 TO CREATE A GLOBAL CROSS-   *
//*              REFERENCE OF EXTERNAL SYMBOLS IN THE PDS.  THIS    *
//*              REPORT PROVIDES INFORMATION OF THE FORM: CSECT IS  *
//*              CONTAINED IN THE FOLLOWING LOAD MODULES ...        *
//*                                                                 *
//*    XREF2     THIS IS THE REPORT PROGRAM TO PROCESS THE OUTPUT   *
//*              OF XREF1.  IT MAY HAVE MULTIPLE XREF1 FILES AS     *
//*              INPUT.  ALL INPUTS WILL BE MERGED WITHIN THE       *
//*              REPORT GENERATION PROCESS.                         *
//*                                                                 *
