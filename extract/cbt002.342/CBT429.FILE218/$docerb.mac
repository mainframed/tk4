                 MPL & ASM MONITOR UNDER "RMFMON"

 REPORTS MPL ADJUSTMENT CONSTANTS AND DOMAIN INFORMATION.  ALSO ASM
 DATA SET SUMMARY.  THIS IS AN "RMFMON" USER COMMAND.  IT MUST BE LINKED
 AS REENTRANT (RENT). THE OBJECT DECK TO INSTALL IS:

             FOR SYSTEM              PDS MEMBER
            ------------            ------------
              MVS 3.8                  MVSOBJ
              MVS/SE2                  SE2OBJ
             MVS/SP1.X                 SE2OBJ
           MVS/SP2.1.0-2              SP212OBJ
            MVS/SP2.1.3               SP213OBJ

 THE EASIEST WAY TO INSTALL THIS IS TO COPY THE CORRECT MEMBER INTO A
 DATASET WITH BLKSIZE=3200 AND ISSUE THE TSO COMMAND:
      LINK dataset LOAD('SYS1.LINKLIB') RENT PRINT(*) LIST XREF

 BEFORE INSTALLATION, ENTER "RMFMON" TO USE IBM'S RMF MONITOR II AND
 THEN KEY "USER" ON THE COMMAND LINE.  THE MESSAGE "INSTALLATION DOES
 NOT SUPPORT A USER PICTURE" OR SOMETHING TO THAT EFFECT SHOULD APPEAR.
 IF ANOTHER MESSAGE OR SCREEN APPEARS, A USER PICTURE IS ALREADY
 INSTALLED AND WILL CONFLICT WITH THE INSTALLATION OF THIS ONE.

 TO OPERATE, KEY THE FOLLOWING ON THE COMMAND LINE:
   "RMFMON"       -- TO USE IBM'S RMF MONITOR II
   "USER ASM"     -- FOR ASM DATA SET SUMMARY (NOT AVAILABLE FOR MVS/XA)
   "USER MPL"     -- FOR MPL ADJUSTMENT CONSTANTS
   "USER HELP"    -- FOR OTHER AVAILABLE OPTIONS (IF ANY)

 INCLUDES:
   FIX FOR ABEND0C9 IN ERBUSASM (CAUSED BY NO SWAP DATA SETS).
   VERSION FOR MVS 3.8.
   CHANGE TO ERBUSMPL TO EXCLUDE SPECIAL PURPOSE DOMAINS (WHERE MIN=MAX=
     CMPL=1) FROM THE DISPLAY.  THEY ARE USUALLY FOR STARTED TASKS THAT
     ARE NON-SWAPABLE ANYWAY.
   TESTED MVS RELEASES INCLUDED IN THE COMMENTS OF THE SOURCE CODE OF
     EACH MODULE.
   FIX FOR SRM INTERVAL DURATION PROBLEM IN ERBUSMPL.  THIS IS CAUSED
     BY AN INCORRECT MACRO "IRARMEP" IN APVTMACS.
