THIS MEMBER HAS BEEN ADDED BY ARNOLD CASINGHINO. THIS FILE WAS
SHIPPED AS SIX SEVERAL FILES ON A TAPE, FOR EASE OF USE EACH
FILE HAS BEEN PUT IN THIS PDS AS A SEPARATE MEMBER.

          FILE001          ASSEMBLER PROGRAMS
          FILE002          ISPF CLISTS
          FILE003          COBOL PROGRAMS
          FILE004          ISPF MESSAGES
          FILE005          ISPF PANELS
          FILE006          ISPF SKELETONS

THE FOLLOWING INSTALLATION STEPS MAY BE FOLLOWED IN ANY ORDER:

STEP 1: COMPILE/ASSEMBLE THE COBOL AND ASM PROGRAMS INTO A LIBRARY THAT
        IS ALLOCATED IN YOUR ISPPLIB CONCATENATION. ALTERNATIVELY, YOU
        MAY LINK INTO LINKLIST TO AVOID USING ISPPLIB. NO SPECIAL
        COMPILE PARMS; USE LANGLVL(2).

STEP 2: COPY THE CLIST MEMBERS TO YOUR CLIST LIBRARY, WHICH MUST BE
        ACCESSIBLE BY YOUR SYSPROC CONCATENATION.

STEP 3: COPY THE ISPPLIB MEMBERS TO YOUR ISPPLIB, WHICH MUST BE
        ACCESSIBLE BY YOUR ISPPLIB CONCATENATION.

        IF YOU WANT TO DEFAULT TO A PARTICULAR PANVALET LIBRARY FOR
        ++INCLUDE PROCESSING, MODIFY THE PANMSEL AND PANTOPDS
        PANELS IN THE )INIT SECTION WITH YOUR DEFAULT DATA SET NAME.

STEP 4: COPY THE ISPSLIB MEMBERS TO YOUR ISPSLIB, WHICH MUST BE
        ACCESSIBLE BY YOUR ISPSLIB CONCATENTAION.

        MODIFY THE JOBCARD SKELETON ACCORDING TO YOUR NEEDS. SOME OF
        THE VARIABLES ARE SET BY THE GENPARMS FUNCTION.

STEP 5: COPY THE ISPMLIB MEMBERS TO YOUR ISPMLIB, WHICH MUST BE
        ACCESSIBLE BY YOUR ISPMLIB CONCATENTATION.

YOU MAY USE THE "ISPEXEC LIBDEF" FUNCTION IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO PUT
THESE MEMBERS INTO YOUR ISPF ALLOCATIONS.  CODE THE PROPER LIBDEF
FUNCTIONS IN CLIST=PANMENU TO POINT TO THE PROPER ISPF LIBRARIES.

NOTES:

* THESE FUNCTIONS WERE CODED ON ISPF RELEASE 2.3 AND TSO/E RELEASE 4.0,
  AND THEREFORE MAY NOT BE FULLY SUPPORTED ON LOWER LEVEL RELEASES. SEE
  DOCUMENTATION IN EACH CLIST FOR A LIST OF CALLED FUNCTIONS.

* THE PANMENU CLIST CHECKS TO SEE IF A CERTAIN VARIABLE EXISTS IN THE
  PROFILE POOL. IF NOT, IT CALLS CLIST=GENPARMS TO SET SCREEN COLORS AND
  ATTRIBUTES, AND JOB CARD PARAMETERS. THE USER MAY SIMPLY HIT ENTER,
  FOLLOWED BY THE END KEY, WHEN PRESENTED WITH THE GENPARMS SCREEN TO
  ACCEPT THE DEFAULT COLORS. THIS WAY EACH USER CAN COLOR CUSTOMIZE
  SCREENS WITHOUT UPDATING PANELS.

  GENPARMS IS A GOOD TOOL TO USE AS A STANDARD FOR ALL ISPF DIALOGS, AS
  IT SETS COMMON VARIABLES THAT MOST DIALOGS NEED.

* A PROTECTION KEY MUST BE SPECIFIED FOR PROTECTED LIBARIES, EVEN
  WHEN ONLY BROWSING THE LIBRARY.  THAT IS BECAUSE MEMBER SELECTION
  LISTS ARE BUILT USING THE '++PRINT 0-UP' COMMAND, WHICH REQUIRES
  THE PROTECTION KEY.

* JUST BEFORE SUBMITTING A JOB IN FOREGROUND OR BACKGROUND, THE
  SYSIN STATMENTS OR THE JCL MAY BE REVIEWED BY THE USER. GENREVU AND
  GENSUB ARE CALLED BY EACH FUNCTION THAT PRODUCES JCL.

  GENREVU AND GENSUB ARE GOOD TOOLS TO USE AS A STANDARD FOR ISPF
  DIALOGS, AS THEY ALLOW THE USER TO MAKE LAST-MINUTE CHANGES.

* THE COBOL PROGRAMS DO NOT DO ANYTHING THAT A CLIST CAN NOT DO; THEY
  ARE CODED SIMPLY FOR PERFORMANCE REASONS.
