     Preface

       This article addresses the exploitation of a
       new source of system maintenance information.
       The program referenced in this article has
       been submitted for distribution on the NaSPA
       MVS VIP tape.

       When writing the article the author has
       assumed that the reader is familiar with the
       IBMLink program offering and has a basic
       working knowledge of SMP/E (Release 5).

       The article and program were written by Kim
       Westerling, a Senior System Programmer for
       the Mutual of Omaha Companies of Omaha,
       Nebraska. He is a member and Vice-President
       of the Great Plains Chapter.


     Introduction

       System Programmers are constantly looking for
       ways to improve the availability and
       reliability of the systems they install and
       maintain. Over the years, hardware and
       software vendors have provided various tools
       to the System Programmer to help in this
       noble cause.

       The most visible of these tools was SMP/E.
       While SMP/E has provided a significant
       reduction in the effort required to install
       and maintain system software, a large portion
       of the System Programmer's activities still
       require some outside assistance. This outside
       assistance usually takes the form of the
       vendor's technical support area.

       More and more vendors are providing access to
       their problem management data bases via
       dial-up bulletin boards. IBM's contribution
       in this area is the IBM Information Network
       and the IBMLink application. These facilities
       are available through either a dedicated SNA
       connection or a dial-up line.


     IBMLink and ServiceLink

       With the availability of the IBMLink
       application, a number of new tools are
       available to the System Programmer. These
       tools make it easier for System Programmers
       to resolve problems in the MVS and VM
       operating System and associated IBM products
       installed at their facilities. The System
       Programmer now has direct access to
       facilities that historically required
       intervention by the IBM Support Center or
       local branch office. The most interesting
       component of IBMLink for the System
       Programmer is ServiceLink. As of January 1,
       1990, ServiceLink consists of six separate
       services. These are:

       SRCHSERV - Service Information Search
       PSP      - Preventive Service Planning
       SRD      - Service Request and Delivery
       ASAP     - Automatic Software Alert Process
       ETR      - Electronic Technical Response
       AST      - APAR Status Tracking

       - SRCHSERV allows the System Programmer to
         search the APAR, PTF, SECOM, and Technical
         Question and Answer libraries.

       - PSP gives the System Programmer access to
         Preventive Service Planning libraries.

       - SRD allows the System Programmer to order
         APAR and PTF fixes, via magnetic or
         electronic medias.

       - ASAP gives the System Programmer the
         ability to receive notifications concerning
         critical maintenance for the MVS, VM, and
         DPPX/370 products.

       - ETR gives the System Programmer the ability
         to electronically report problems and to
         ask questions of a technical nature.

       - AST allows the System Programmer to track
         open APARs. The System Programmer is
         notified whenever a change is made to the
         APAR's record.

       Some of the features of ServiceLink require
       special authorization from IBM. See your IBM
       account representative for more information.

       This article will focus on the data provided
       by the ASAP service. The following
       description of the ASAP service is excerpted
       from the SERVICELINK USER'S GUIDE, SH52-0300.

         "ASAP notifications include information
         about high-impact and pervasive (HIPER)
         APARs, PTFs in error, zaps in error, and
         the corresponding fixes. You list the
         product(s) that you want to be notified
         about in your ASAP profile.

         ASAP lists the products that you have
         requested to be notified about, and the
         corresponding APARs and PTFs. This list
         is called your 'ASAP notification list'."

       Each entry in the ASAP notification list
       contains eight fields. These fields are:

         1. APAR/Fixing PTF - The number of the
            APAR or fixing PTF.

         2. Notify Type - The category of the
            notification.
            a. HIPERAPAR
            b. HIPER FIX
            c. PE
            d. PE FIX
            e. PE DELETE
            f. ZE APAR

         3. APAR/PE PTF - The number of the APAR
            or PE PTF.

         4. Product Number - For MVS this is the
            product FMID. For VM and DPPX/370
            this is the component identifier.

         5. Release - The release number of the
            component identifier, VM and DPPX/370
            only.

         6. Notify Date - The date that IBM
            changed the APAR or PTF.

         7. Order Number - The number IBM assigned
            to your PTF order (PE FIX and HIPER
            FIX only).

         8. Product Identifier - The name of the
            product.

       In addition to the notifications, the ASAP
       service allows you to order fixing PTFs,
       delete entries from the notification list,
       or request that SMP/E HOLD and RELEASE
       cards be generated. A complete description
       of the ASAP service can be found in the
       SERVICELINK USER'S GUIDE, SH52-0300.

       While there is a large amount of information
       available in the ASAP data, IBM has not yet
       provided the System Programmer with any tools
       to help automate the utilization of this
       information. Reviewing and cross referencing
       the ASAP data has been strictly a manual
       process. The IEBASAP utility program attempts
       to reduce the manual effort involved in using
       the ASAP data.


     What is IEBASAP?

       IEBASAP is a utility program designed to
       process the ASAP data from the IBM
       ServiceLink application. The program
       maintains the ASAP notification data in a
       VSAM KSDS data set. The program will also
       report on the contents of the data set.
       IEBASAP has the capability to
       cross-reference the ASAP data with the
       installation's SMP/E data to determine if
       an installation has in-error maintenance
       installed, or if any known fixing
       maintenance is installed. While the IEBASAP
       program supports both MVS and VM ASAP data,
       it can currently only be executed on an MVS
       system.

       IEBASAP has four primary commands; UPDATE,
       LIST, XREF, and CLEANUP. The UPDATE command
       is used to create and maintain the ASAP
       data base. The LIST routine is used to
       print the contents of the ASAP data base.
       The XREF command is used to cross reference
       the ASAP data base against an SMP/E TARGET
       or DLIB zone. The CLEANUP command is used
       to delete records from the ASAP data base
       when the FMID in the ASAP record is no
       longer in the SMP/E GLOBAL zone. Each of
       these commands is discussed in greater
       detail later in the article. Only the
       UPDATE and LIST commands support VM format
       data.

       The SET command is used to indicate whether
       the data being processed is MVS or VM and
       to set the page length for the output
       reports. The default data type is MVS and
       the default page length is 60. The SET
       control card is shown in Figure 1.


     Why IEBASAP?

       IEBASAP was written to help process an ever
       increasing number of ASAP notifications. As
       more FMIDs were placed in the ASAP profile,
       the number of notifications received also
       increased. Early on it had been decided to
       'process' the ASAP notifications on a weekly
       basis, rather than as they arrived. The
       reason for this was that on some days there
       might not be any new ASAP notifications or
       the ASAP data would be the only reason for
       logging onto IBMLink.

       The weekly processing worked well with
       smaller numbers of notifications, but the
       larger shipments of notifications were
       becoming difficult to process. The time to
       review the notifications on IBMLink, then
       print a copy to either a local printer or
       to a userid on a local host, check the
       notifications against the SMP/E data bases,
       and so on, was growing. In addition to the
       time involved in checking the ASAP data,
       the overhead of maintaining a record of the
       ASAP data increased as well.

       Something was needed to help automate the
       process. IEBASAP started simply as a way to
       keep track of the ASAP notifications. It read
       an input file consisting of the notifications
       and created/updated the data base. The data
       base was 'printed' using IDCAMS REPRO to copy
       the data to a sequential data set and then
       printed using IEBGENER.


     The ASAP Notifications

       The ASAP notifications can be made available
       for processing on the user's system in
       multiple ways. The first is to print the data
       to a local printer and then enter the data
       manually. The second, and recommended method,
       is to 'print' the data to a userid on a local
       host. The data is sent in TSO
       TRANSMIT/RECEIVE format. The TSO RECEIVE
       command is then used to retrieve the ASAP
       data. Users that use dial-up access could
       capture the data on their PC and then upload
       the data to their host system.

       The data is loaded with the following DCB
       attributes; RECFM of FB, LRECL of 89, and a
       BLKSIZE of 32752. The format of the ASAP
       notifications is shown in Figure 2. The
       names shown are those used by the program.
       A sample of the ASAP notifications is shown
       in Example 1. This sample will be the basis
       for all IEBASAP examples.

       It is recommended that the ASAP
       notifications be pre-sorted using the
       control card shown in Figure 3. This will
       insure that the notifications are processed
       consistently each time the program is
       executed.


     The IEBASAP Data Base

       The ASAP data base is a VSAM KSDS data set.
       The IDCAMS control cards for the allocation
       of the data set are listed in Figure 4. The
       data set must be primed with a blank record
       or IEBASAP will terminate with an error when
       accessing the VSAM data set. The ASAP data
       base is defined with a SHAREOPTIONS of 2,
       allowing for an unrestricted number of read
       users and only one write user.

       The data base records are 72 bytes in length
       and have a 16-byte key. The key for the ASAP
       data base record consists of the APAR and the
       FMID from the ASAP notification. The FMID in
       the ASAP notification is nine bytes long.
       This is because the VM notifications use a
       9-byte component identifier versus the 7-byte
       MVS FMID. The format of the ASAP data base
       records is shown in Figure 5. The names shown
       are those used by the program.


     IEBASAP Data Sets

       The program uses several different data
       sets during execution. The program creates
       two output report data sets, ASAPOUT and
       ASAPRPT. Both have an LRECL of 121 and a
       RECFM of FBA. Sample output can be seen in
       Examples 2 through 6.

       The ASAPOUT data set contains the control
       cards used in the execution of the program,
       messages from the program relating to the
       control cards and any input records that
       were not processed by the program.

       The ASAPRPT data set contains information
       detailing the actions performed against the
       ASAP data base.

       The ASAPDB DD statement is used to identify
       the ASAP data base.

       The ASAPUPD DD statement is used to
       identify the ASAP notification data set.
       The ASAPUPD DD statement is required only
       when executing the UPDATE command.

       The SMPCSI DD statement identifies an SMP/E
       GLOBAL zone. The SMPCSI DD statement is
       required only when executing the XREF and
       CLEANUP commands.

       No DD statements are needed for the TARGET
       or DLIB zones. The IEBASAP program will
       dynamically allocate these data sets as
       needed. The data set names are determined
       by examining the ZONE INDEX records in the
       GLOBAL zone. IEBASAP does issue ENQUEUEs
       for the SMP/E data sets using the same
       QNAME and RNAMEs as SMP/E to insure data
       set integrity.

       The SYSIN DD statement is used to provide
       the program control cards. The control
       cards are 80-byte images. The command name
       must begin between columns 1 and 16.

       The ASAPOUT, ASAPRPT, ASAPDB, and SYSIN DD
       statements are required for all executions
       of the program.

       Sample JCL is shown in Figure 6.


     UPDATE Command

       The UPDATE command creates and maintains
       the data base of ASAP notifications. The
       UPDATE command has only one option, CHECK.
       The CHECK option allows the user to
       simulate the update of the data base. The
       control card is shown in Figure 1.

       The UPDATE command reads records from the
       ASAPUPD data set and then does a read
       against the ASAP data base to determine if
       a corresponding record exists. If the
       record exists, the new or changed
       information is merged with the existing
       record. If the record does not exist, it is
       added to the data base.

       For each new or updated data base record a
       record is written to the ASAPRPT data set.
       Samples of the reports produced by the
       UPDATE command are in Example 3.

       Currently only HIPERAPAR, HIPER FIX, PE,
       and PE FIX records are processed by
       IEBASAP. See the 'Future of IEBASAP'
       section later in this article for comments
       on other record types.


     LIST Command

       The LIST command prints the contents of the
       ASAP data base. The LIST command has two
       options, FMID(xyynnnn) and FMIDGRP(yy). The
       FMID option allows the user to list only
       the entries in the data base for the
       specified FMID. The FMIDGRP option allows
       the user to list the entries for the
       specified group of FMIDs.

       I.E. FMID(HVT3102) will list records for
       that ACF/VTAM FMID and FMIDGRP(VT) will list
       records for all FMIDs relating to ACF/VTAM.
       The FMID and FMIDGRP options are used
       primarily with MVS format data. The control
       card is shown in Figure 1.

       The LIST command reads the ASAP data base
       sequentially and a record is written to the
       ASAPRPT data set for each record in the data
       base. Samples of the reports produced by the
       LIST command are in Example 4.


     XREF Command

       The XREF command cross references the ASAP
       data base records against an SMP/E TARGET
       or DLIB zone. There is one required
       parameter for the XREF command, the TARGET
       or DLIB zone that IEBASAP is to use. The
       XREF command has two options, CLEANUP and
       CHECK. The CLEANUP option will delete from
       the ASAP data base any records that contain
       a fixing PTF that is installed in the
       specified zone. The CHECK option allows the
       user to simulate the deletion of records
       from the ASAP data base. The CHECK option
       is valid only with the CLEANUP option. If
       specified without the CLEANUP option, it is
       ignored. The control card is shown in
       Figure 1.

       The XREF command reads the ASAP data base
       sequentially and the FMID from each ASAP
       record is checked against the GLOBAL zone's
       FMID list. If the FMID is not in the FMID
       list, the next ASAP record is retrieved. If
       the FMID is in the FMID list, the ASAP
       record is checked for a PE PTF. If there is
       a PE PTF, the specified zone is checked for
       the PE PTF. The ASAP record is then checked
       for a fixing PTF. When there is a fixing
       PTF, the specified zone is checked for the
       fixing PTF. If the fixing PTF is not in the
       specified zone, the GLOBAL zone is checked
       to see if the fixing PTF has been received.
       If the CLEANUP option was specified and the
       fixing PTF is installed in the specified
       zone, the corresponding ASAP data base
       record is deleted.

       Records are written to the ASAPRPT data set
       detailing the results of the processing
       described above. Samples of the reports
       produced by the XREF command are in
       Example 5.


     CLEANUP Command

       The CLEANUP command deletes records from
       the ASAP data base when the FMID in the
       ASAP record is no longer in the GLOBAL
       zone's FMID list. The CLEANUP command has
       one option, CHECK. The CHECK option allows
       the user to simulate the deletion of
       records from the data base. The control
       card is shown in Figure 1.

       The CLEANUP command reads the ASAP data
       base sequentially and the FMID from each
       ASAP record is checked against the GLOBAL
       zone's FMID list. If the FMID is in the
       FMID list, the next ASAP record is
       retrieved. If not, the corresponding ASAP
       data base record is deleted.

       A record is written to ASAPRPT data set for
       each record deleted. Samples of the reports
       produced by the CLEANUP command are in
       Example 6.


     SHARE Requirements

       SHARE requirement SOMVSE90011, 'IBMLink ASAP
       Needs Automated Process to Interact with
       SMP/E', identifies five requirements to IBM
       regarding the processing of the ASAP data.
       IEBASAP was started in the fall of 1989 with
       no knowledge of the SHARE requirements until
       the ballot arrived in February of 1990.

       The current and future versions of IEBASAP
       address these requirements to some degree.
       Unfortunately, IBM has not yet announced
       the added capabilities needed to fulfill
       all of the requirements. The most
       significant of the required capabilities
       are:

         1. The ability to receive ASAP data
         directly at the customer's host without
         having to logon to IBMLink.

         2. The ability to interact with the other
         ServiceLink facilities from the
         customer's host processor.

       IEBASAP is a first step in allowing the
       System Programmer to manage his/her ASAP
       data in an automated manner and to continue
       to take a pro-active approach to installing
       maintenance to the MVS and VM operating
       systems.


     Future of IEBASAP

       The IEBASAP program is not yet fully
       developed. Future enhancements will include
       a DELETE command, expanded reporting
       capabilities, and support for ZE APAR and
       PE DELETE records. The ZE APAR and PE
       DELETE records are presently written to the
       ASAPOUT data set when they are encountered
       in the ASAPUPD data set. IEBASAP currently
       identifies an APAR that is written against
       more than one PTF by putting the literal
       *MULTI* in the PE PTF field of the ASAP
       record.


     Availability of IEBASAP

       The IEBASAP program, as described in this
       article, has been submitted for distribution
       on the NaSPA MVS VIP tape. Comments and
       questions concerning the program and its
       use can be sent to the address in the
       source.

       As with any program on the VIP tape the
       user must evaluate the program to determine
       if the program will introduce any exposure
       in their systems. The IEBASAP program does
       read the SMP/E data sets directly. As a
       result the user must take appropriate
       action to insure that no SMP/E functions
       are executing at the same time as IEBASAP.
