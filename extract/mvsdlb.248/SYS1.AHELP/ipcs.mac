=EVALUATE=EVAL
)F FUNCTION
   USE THE EVALUATE SUBCOMMAND TO RETRIEVE DATA FROM A DUMP
   AND USE IT AS A RETURN CODE TO A CLIST.  THE SUBCOMMAND
   RETRIEVES A MAXIMUM OF 4 BYTES OF DATA, RIGHT JUSTIFIES IT IN
   REGISTER 15 AND ZEROES THE HIGH-ORDER BYTE.  MAY BE ACCESSED VIA
   A CLIST VARIABLE NAMED &LASTCC.  BECAUSE OF THIS, EVALUATE HAS
   LITTLE USE OTHER THAN IN CLIST'S SINCE THE RETRIEVED DATA IN
   &LASTCC IS NOT AVAILABLE TO SUBCOMMANDS NOT IN THE CLIST.

   EACH SUBCOMMAND IN A CLIST RESETS &LASTCC.  THUS THE DATA
   RETRIEVED BY EVALUATE MUST BE EXAMINED OR MOVED FROM &LASTCC
   BEFORE ANOTHER SUBCOMMAND IN THE CLIST OVERLAYS IT.
   EXERCISE CARE IN USING THE CONTENTS OF &LASTCC AFTER THIS
   SUBCOMMAND.  IT MAY CONTAIN DATA OR A RETURN CODE, AND YOU
   HAVE NO WAY OF KNOWING WHICH.  FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE SPECIFIED
   STORAGE CANNOT BE RETRIEVED, EVALUATE PUTS X'0000000C' IN

=FIND=F
)F FUNCTION -
   USE THE FIND SUBCOMMAND TO LOCATE DATA IN A DUMP.  YOU CAN
   LIMIT THE SEARCH BY SPECIFYING THE RANGE OF ADDRESSES TO BE
   SEARCHED OR BY SPECIFYING A BOUNDARY AND THE LOCATION
   RELATIVE TO THE BOUNDARY.

   FIND USES THE SYMBOL FINDAREA (RECORDED IN THE SYMBOL TABLE)
   TO DESCRIBE THE BEGINNING ADDRESS AND THE LENGTH OF THE AREA
   BEING SEARCHED.  THIS AREA IS CALLED THE SEARCH RANGE.  IF
   YOU DO NOT SPECIFY AN ENDING ADDRESS FOR THE SEARCH, FIND
   SETS THE LENGTH OF THE SEARCH RANGE SO THE SEARCH ENDS AT
   X'FFFFFF'.

   FIND SETS X (THE CURRENT ADDRESS) TO THE BEGINNING ADDRESS
   OF THE SEARCH RANGE.  IF IT FINDS THE SEARCH ARGUMENT, FIND
   SETS X TO THE ADDRESS.  IF IT DOES NOT FIND THE SEARCH ARGUMENT,
   FIND LEAVES X SET TO THE BEGINNING OF THE SEARCH RANGE.

   ONCE THE SUBCOMMAND SETS THE SEARCH RANGE, IF YOU ENTER ANOTHER
   FIND WITHOUT SPECIFYING A NEW RANGE, AND IF X IS OUTSIDE
   THE CURRENT RANGE (THIS COULD  HAPPEN IF YOU MODIFIED
   FINDAREA OR X OR BOTH BETWEEN THE TWO FIND SUBCOMMANDS),
   FIND TERMINATES IMMEDIATELY.  HOWEVER, IF X IS WITHIN THE
   SEARCH RANGE, FIND SETS X TO THE BEGINNING ADDRESS OF THE
   SEARCH RANGE.

   FIND WITHOUT A SEARCH ARGUMENT OR ADDRESS RANGE ATTEMPTS TO
   LOCATE THE LAST-ENTERED ARGUMENT, STARTING AT X+1.

   FIND SAVES THE SEARCH ARGUMENT, BOUNDARY, OFFSET, AND ASID
   BETWEEN USES OF THE SUBCOMMAND.  IT DOES NOT SAVE THE MASK.
   YOU MUST SPECIFY A SEARCH ARGUMENT THE FIRST TIME YOU USE
   FIND IN AN IPCS SESSION.

   THE SCAN SUBCOMMAND INITIATES ITS PROCESSING FROM YOUR

   THE STORAGE MAP THAT ARE WITHIN THE ADDRESS RANGE SPECIFIED
   BY YOU.  AS IT VALIDATES EACH CONTROL BLOCK, SCAN MAKES NEW
   ENTRIES IN THE STORAGE MAP FOR THE CONTROL BLOCKS POINTED TO
   FROM THE BLOCK BEING VALIDATED.  DEPENDING ON THE DEPTH AND
   PASSES KEYWORDS, THESE NEW ENTRIES (CONTROL BLOCKS) IN THE
   MAP MAY OR MAY NOT THEMSELVES BE VALIDATED.  BUT EVEN IF
