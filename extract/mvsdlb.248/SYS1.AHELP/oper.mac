  DELETE COMMANDS:

         SLIP/SL MOD,ENABLE/DISABLE,ALL/ID='XXXX'

         SLIP/SL DEL,ALL/ID='XXXX'

  REQUIRED - SET, MOD, OR DEL.
           - ID OR ALL (WHEN MOD OR DEL IS SPECIFIED).
           - ENABLE OR DISABLE (WHEN MOD IS SPECIFIED).
           - RANGE OR LPAMOD (WHEN SETTING AN IF OR SB PER TRAP).
           - RANGE (WHEN SETTING AN SA PER TRAP UNLESS
             ACTION=IGNORE IS USED).
           - END (COMPLETES THE SLIP SET COMMAND).

  OPTIONAL - ALL OTHER KEYWORDS.
           - ALL PARAMETERS SHOWN BETWEEN < AND >.

  DEFAULTS - FOR PER TRAPS (IF,SB, OR SA SPECIFIED):
             ENABLE,ACTION=SVCD,

           - FOR NON-PER TRAPS (IF,SB, OR SA NOT SPECIFIED):
             ENABLE,ACTION=SVCD,RBLEVEL=ERROR

                MATCHLIM=1(FOR PER TRAPS ONLY)
           - IF TRACE IS CHOSEN AS AN ACTION, TRDATA=STD IS THE
             DEFAULT TRACE RECORD REQUESTED.
           - IF TRDUMP IS CHOSEN AS AN ACTION, TRDATA=STD IS THE
             DEFAULT TRACE RECORD REQUESTED AND SDATA=TRT IS THE
             DEFAULT DUMP REQUESTED.

  NOTES    - THE SLIP USER MUST SUPPLY INFORMATION FOR ITEMS ENCLOSED
             IN SINGLE QUOTES ('). THE QUOTES ARE NOT PART OF THE
             COMMAND SYNTAX.
           - IF THE USER HAS A CHOICE, THIS IS INDICATED BY A SLASH
             (/) BETWEEN THE ITEMS THAT MAY BE CHOSEN. THE SLASH IS
             NOT PART OF THE COMMAND SYNTAX.
           - PROMPTING WILL OCCUR FOR MISSING REQUIRED
             PARAMETERS, INVALIDLY SPECIFIED PARAMETERS, AND
             INCOMPLETE (END NOT SPECIFIED) TRAPS.
           - IN OPERATOR COMMAND SYNTAX, BLANKS ARE THE ONLY
             SEPARATORS ALLOWED BETWEEN THE COMMAND AND OPERAND.
           - OPERANDS MUST BE SEPARATED BY ONE COMMA.
           - SB,IF, OR SA MUST IMMEDIATELY FOLLOW SET WHEN SPECIFIED.
           - THE FOLLOWING KEYWORDS AND OPTIONS ARE INVALID FOR
             NON-PER TRAPS:
             RANGE, PRCNTLIM, RECOVERY.
           - THE FOLLOWING KEYWORDS AND OPTIONS ARE INVALID FOR
             PER TRAPS:
             NODUMP, ERRTYP, COMP, RBLEVEL.
           - ACTION=WAIT IS NOT AVAILABLE TO A TSO USER OF SLIP.
           - GTF MUST BE ACTIVE WITH THE GTF SLIP OPTION TO COLLECT
             SLIP RECORDS WITH THE TRACE, TRDUMP OR DEBUG OPTION.
           - FOR IF AND SB PER TRAPS, THE STORAGE RANGE MONITORED BY
             THE PER HARDWARE SHOULD INCLUDE EXECUTABLE INSTRUCTIONS.
           - FOR SA PER TRAPS, THE STORAGE RANGE MONITORED BY THE PER
             HARDWARE SHOULD USUALLY BE CONTROL BLOCK OR DATA AREAS.
           - FOR SA PER TRAPS THAT HAVE ACTION=IGNORE, RANGE
             CANNOT BE SPECIFIED.
           - THE SLIP COMMAND ACCEPTS ONLY ONE LINE AT A TIME FOR
             INPUT BUT ALLOWS THE USER TO ENTER AS MANY LINES AS
             NEEDED USING THE FOLLOWING MECHANISM:
             1) A BLANK (EXCEPT BETWEEN SLIP AND SET, MOD, OR DEL)
                SIGNIFIES THE END OF THAT LINE OF INPUT.
             2) THE LINE OF INPUT CAN END ANYWHERE A COMMA OR
                PARENTHESIS EXISTS WITHIN THE COMMAND (THE
                PARENTHESIS AROUND THE BINARY INDICATOR OF THE TARGET
                IN THE DATA KEYWORD IS THE ONLY EXCEPTION).
             3) THE END KEYWORD ON THE SET COMMAND SIGNIFIES THE
                DEFINITION OF THE TRAP IS COMPLETE.
             4) WHEN PROMPTING THE USER FOR THE NEXT LINE ON AN
                INCOMPLETE SET COMMAND, THE PARAMETERS SPECIFIED
                AND DEFAULTED TO WILL BE DISPLAYED.
           - ONLY ONE NON-IGNORE PER TRAP MAY BE ENABLED AT ONE TIME.

)O OPERANDS
))SET      - CAUSES A SLIP TRAP TO BE CREATED.
))MOD      - ALLOWS AN EXISTING SLIP TRAP TO BE ENABLED OR DISABLED.
))DEL      - CAUSES AN EXISTING SLIP TRAP TO BE DELETED.
))IF       - SPECIFIES A PER INSTRUCTION FETCH TRAP.
))SB       - SPECIFIES A PER SUCCESSFUL BRANCH TRAP.
))SA       - SPECIFIES A PER STORAGE ALTERATION TRAP.

))ENABLE   - SPECIFIES THAT THE TRAP IS TO BE ACTIVE (CHECKED FOR
             MATCH). THIS IS THE DEFAULT WHEN A TRAP IS INITIALLY
             SET.

))DISABLE  - SPECIFIES THAT THE TRAP IS TO BE INACTIVE (NEVER CHECKED
             FOR MATCH).

))ALL      - SPECIFIES THAT ALL EXISTING SLIP TRAPS ARE TO BE AFFECTED.

))ID       - SPECIFIES A 1 TO 4 CHARACTER ALPHANUMERIC STRING USED TO
             IDENTIFY THE TRAP. WHEN A TRAP IS INITIALLY SET, IF THIS
             OPERAND IS OMITTED, THE SYSTEM WILL ASSIGN AN ID.

    ID KEYWORD EXAMPLE:   ID=PER1

))ACTION   - DEFINES WHAT ACTION IS TO BE TAKEN WHEN THE TRAP
             CONDITIONS ARE MATCHED.
    SVCD     - INDICATES AN SVC DUMP WILL BE SCHEDULED FOR THE CURRENT
               (OR FAILING) ADDRESS SPACE. THIS IS THE DEFAULT.
    TRACE    - PROVIDES FOR THE COLLECTION OF GTF TRACE RECORDS FOR
               EACH MATCHING EVENT PROVIDED GTF IS ACTIVE AND THE GTF
               SLIP OPTION HAS BEEN CHOSEN.
    TRDUMP   - PROVIDES FOR THE COLLECTION OF GTF TRACE RECORDS FOR
               EACH MATCHING EVENT PROVIDED GTF IS ACTIVE AND THE GTF
               SLIP OPTION HAS BEEN CHOSEN. WHEN THE TRAP IS
               DISABLED OR DELETED, AN SVC DUMP WILL BE SCHEDULED.
    IGNORE   - CAUSES THE SYSTEM TO PROCEED WITH NORMAL PROCESSING WHEN
               THE SPECIFIED EVENT OCCURS. THIS OPTION IS NORMALLY
               USED TO EXCLUDE A SUBSET OF EVENTS FROM BEING TRAPPED
               BY A DIFFERENT, MORE GENERAL, SLIP TRAP.
    NODUMP   - CAUSES DUMPS TO BE SUPPRESSED WHEN THE CONDITIONS
               DEFINED IN THE TRAP OCCUR. THIS ACTION IS NOT VALID
               FOR PER TRAPS.
    RECOVERY - FORCES PER TRAPS TO INITIATE RECOVERY FOR THE
               INTERRUPTED PROCESS AFTER THE ACTION IS PERFORMED.
               THIS KEYWORD IS VALID ONLY FOR PER TRAPS.

    ACTION KEYWORD EXAMPLE:   ACTION=SVCD

))TRDATA   - SPECIFIES THE TYPE AND CONTENT OF THE GTF TRACE RECORDS
             COLLECTED WHEN USED WITH ACTION=TRACE AND ACTION=TRDUMP.
             THE SYNTAX FOR TRDATA IS:
             TRDATA=(STD<,REGS><,'LIST'>/'LIST'/REGS<,LIST>)
    STD      - SPECIFIES THAT THE TRACE RECORDS WILL CONTAIN THE
               INFORMATION IN THE STANDARD SLIP RECORD.
    REGS     - SPECIFIES THAT THE TRACE RECORDS WILL CONTAIN THE 16
               GENERAL PURPOSE REGISTERS AT THE TIME OF THE INTERRUPT
               OR ERROR.
    'LIST'   - SPECIFIES ONE OR MORE PAIRS OF ADDRESSES TO BE DUMPED.
               ADDRESSES MAY BE EITHER DIRECT OR INDIRECT (SEE LIST
               KEYWORD).

             IF ONLY STD IS SPECIFIED WITH 'LIST', THE 'LIST' MAY
             REQUEST UP TO 136 BYTES OF USER DEFINED DATA (INCLUDING
             A ONE BYTE LENGTH FIELD FOR EACH ADDRESS PAIR REQUESTED).

             PROVIDED THAT GTF IS ACTIVE AND THE GTF SLIP OPTION HAS
             BEEN CHOSEN. THE RECORD WRITTEN CONTAINS INFORMATION

))END      - SPECIFIES THAT NO ADDITIONAL SLIP PARAMETERS WILL BE
             ENTERED.
