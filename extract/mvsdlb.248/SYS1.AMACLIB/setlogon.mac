*     THAT NO MORE LOGON REQUESTS ARE TO BE QUEUED FOR THE APPLICATION
*     VIA THE SPECIFIED ACB
*
*01*  NOTES = THIS OPTION ALLOWS AN APPLICATION ALREADY RECEIVING
*     REQUESTS FOR LOGON TO CLOSE DOWN IN A WAY THAT IS LEAST LIKELY TO
*     CAUSE OPERATOR CONCERN.  IF THIS FACILITY IS NOT AVAILABLE, THERE
*     IS POTENTIALLLY A LONG PERIOD OF TIME (FROM THE TIME THE SYSTEM
*     ACCEPTS THE LOGON REQUEST TO WHEN THE ACB IS CLOSED) DURING WHICH
*     FURTHER LOGON REQUESTS ARE QUEUED,  ONLY TO BE REJECTED WHEN THE
*     ACB IS CLOSED
*
*     THIS MACRO GENERATES NO CODE ITSELF, BUT INVOKES AN INNER
*     MACRO (IHBRDWRA) TO GENERATE CODE TO MODIFY THE RPL AND LINK
*     TO THE INTERFACE ROUTINE THAT WILL BEGIN PROCESSING THE REQUEST.
