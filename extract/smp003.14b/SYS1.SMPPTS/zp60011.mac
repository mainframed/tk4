++USERMOD(ZP60011)            /* TRACE SIO CHANNEL PROGRAM */  .
++VER(Z038) FMID(FBB1221)
 /*
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
     GTF CANNOT TRACE ANY CCWS USED IN A CHANNEL PROGRAM.
       GTF DOES NOT PROVIDE A FACILITY FOR PERFORMING A CCW TRACE.
       CCW TRACES ARE A SIGNIFICANT TOOL FOR DIAGNOSING I/O PROBLEMS.

       THIS USERMOD CHANGES THE SIO RECORD BUILD ROUTINE TO CAPTURE
       UP TO 25 CCWS IN AN I/O PROGRAM PROCESSED BY SIO, AND PLACE
       THE CONTENTS INTO THE GTF SIO TRACE RECORD.  STRICTLY
       SPEAKING, THIS IS NOT A CCW TRACE AS THERE IS NO GUARANTEE
       THAT ALL OF THE CAPTURED CCWS WERE EXECUTED BY THE CHANNEL.
       UP TO 8 BYTES OF WRITE DATA MAY BE CAPTURED FOR NON-DASD
       DEVICES WHICH IS STORED IN THE SEEK ADDRESS TRACE FIELD.

       ADDITIONALLY THE SIO TRACE RECORD FORMAT ROUTINE IS ALTERED
       TO FORMAT CAPTURED CCWS, EACH ONE ON ITS OWN PRINT LINE.

   SPECIAL CONDITIONS:
     ACTION:
       A "CLPA" MUST BE PERFORMED AT IPL TIME FOR THIS SYSMOD TO
       BECOME ACTIVE.

   COMMENTS:
     PRYCROFT SIX P/L PUBLIC DOMAIN USERMOD FOR MVS 3.8 NUMBER 11.
