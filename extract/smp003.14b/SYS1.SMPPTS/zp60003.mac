   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
     THE XF ASSEMBLER CANNOT ACCEPT BLANK INPUT SOURCE RECORDS.
       MUCH ASSEMBLER CODE WRITTEN FOR THE HIGH-LEVEL ASSEMBLER
       WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE BE FULLY PROCESSABLE BY PUBLICLY
       AVAILABLE ASSEMBLERS CANNOT BE PROCESSED BECAUSE OF
       CHANGES TO RULES FOR ALLOWABLE INPUT.  ONE SUCH RULE IS
       THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE "SPACE" ASSEMBLER INSTRUCTION
       WHENEVER A BLANK LINE IS TO BE PRODUCED IN THE OUTPUT
       LISTING, WHEREAS THE HIGH-LEVEL ASSEMBLER (ASMA90) CAN
       ALSO ACCEPT BLANK INPUT RECORDS.

       THIS USERMOD UPDATES THE XF ASSEMBLER (IFOX00) TO
       ALLOW RECORDS WITH BLANKS IN THE FIRST 72 COLUMNS AS
       VALID INPUT.  NEW LOGIC ADDS THE INTERNAL TEXT FOR THE
       "SPACE" INSTRUCTION IN COLUMN 10 BEFORE THE INPUT RECORD
       IS PARSED WHENEVER A RECORD IS FOUND TO START WITH 72
       BLANKS.

   SPECIAL CONDITIONS:
     NONE.
