   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
     SYSTEM TRACE DOES NOT CAPTURE THE MODULE NAME OF THE EVENT.
       PROGRAM INTERRUPTS, INCLUDING THOSE CAUSED BY MONITOR CALL
       (MC) INSTRUCTIONS HAVE THE PSW CONTENTS REPORTED BUT FURTHER
       DATA ANALYSIS IS NEEDED TO OBTAIN THE MODULE NAME WHERE THE
       EVENT TOOK PLACE.

       THIS USERMOD OVERLAYS THE R0 CONTENTS IN THE SYSTEM TRACE
       DATA FORMATTED IN A DUMP IN CASES WHERE
         (1) THE TRACE EVENT IS A PROGRAM INTERRUPT, AND
         (2) THE PSW ADDRESS CORRESPONDS TO A PLPA MODULE.

       THE 'R0' LABEL IS OVERLAID WITH 'EP' WHEN THE ADDRESS
       CORRESPONDS TO THE DISPLAYED ENTRY POINT, AND 'R0' IS
       OVERLAID WITH 'NM' WHEN THE ADDRESS HAS ONLY BEEN RESOLVED
       TO RESIDE IN THE EXTENT OF THE NAMED MODULE.

       SVC INTERRUPT TRACE ENTRIES ARE NOW FORMATTED TO SHOW THE
       DECIMAL SVC NUMBER.

       PER PROGRAM CHECKS ARE FLAGGED WITH THE LITERAL 'PER'.  MC
       INSTRUCTION PROGRAM CHECKS ARE FLAGGED WITH THE LITERAL 'MC'.
       OTHER PROGRAM CHECKS (EXCEPT PAGE FAULTS) ARE FLAGGED WITH
       THE LITERAL '**'.

   SPECIAL CONDITIONS:
     ACTION:
       A "CLPA" MUST BE PERFORMED AT IPL TIME FOR THIS SYSMOD TO
       BECOME ACTIVE.
