++USERMOD(ZP60016)     /* REPORT JES2 STATUS SEARCH RESULTS */  .

 /*
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
     TSO STATUS ONLY LOOKS FOR JOB NAMES OF USERID PLUS ONE CHARACTER.
       WHEN THE TSO STATUS COMMAND IS ISSUED WITHOUT ANY OPERAND
       THE SYSTEM LOOKS FOR ALL JOBS WITH NAMES BEGINNING WITH THE
       USERID PLUS ONE CHARACTER.  IF THE USERID IS SHORTER THAN
       SEVEN CHARACTERS THEN OTHER JOBS WITH NAMES BEGINNING WITH
       THE USERID BUT HAVING MORE THAN ONE EXTRA CHARACTER ARE NOT
       REPORTED BY THE STATUS COMMAND.

       THIS USERMOD ALTERS THE STATUS COMMAND TO REPORT UP TO
       THREE EXTRA CHARACTERS AFTER THE USERID IN THE JOB NAME.
       THESE JOBS WILL HAVE BEEN RETURNED BY JES2 PROCESSING AFTER
       THE ACTIVATION OF ZP60015.  WITHOUT THIS SYSMOD SUCH JOBS
       WILL BE REPORTED WITHOUT THE UP TO TWO EXTRA CHARACTERS
       IN THE JOB NAME.

   SPECIAL CONDITIONS:
     NONE.
