++USERMOD(ZP60030)       /* FIX MF/1 CHANNEL MEASUREMENT */  .
++VER(Z038) FMID(EMF1102)
 /*
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
     MF/1 DOES NOT CORRECTLY ACCESS THE CHANNEL AVAILABILITY TABLE.
       THE CHANNEL AVAILABILITY TABLE (CAT) HAS MOVED FROM THE
       PCCA (WHERE THERE WAS ONE FOR EACH ACTIVE CPU) TO COMMON
       STORAGE (SQA).  FURTHER, CAT ENTRIES HAVE BEEN EXTENDED
       FROM EIGHT BYTES IN LENGTH TO SIXTEEN BYTES IN LENGTH.

       THIS USERMOD UPDATES THE MF/1 CHANNEL SAMPLING MODULE
       IRBMFECH AND THE MF/1 CHANNEL INITIALIZATION MODULE
       IRBMFIHA TO CORRECT ACCESS CAT ENTRIES.

       A CONSEQUENCE OF THIS IS THAT TYPE 73 SMF RECORDS WILL
       NOW CONTAIN NON-ZERO CHANNEL DATA.

   SPECIAL CONDITIONS:
     ACTION:
       A "CLPA" MUST BE PERFORMED AT IPL TIME FOR THIS SYSMOD TO
       BECOME ACTIVE.

   COMMENTS:
     PRYCROFT SIX P/L PUBLIC DOMAIN USERMOD FOR MVS 3.8 NUMBER 30.

     REWORK HISTORY:
       2011-01-30: INITIAL VERSION.
