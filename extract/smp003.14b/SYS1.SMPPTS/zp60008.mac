 /*
   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
     ERASE/WRITE ALTERNATE AND WRITE STRUCTURED FIELD NOT SUPPORTED.
       VTAM APPLICATIONS CANNOT USE EXTENDED 3270 FACILITIES SINCE
       VTAM DOES NOT SUPPORT THE WRITE STRUCTURED FIELD (WSF)
       COMMAND NECESSARY TO ISSUE A READ PARTITION (QUERY) TO THE
       TERMINAL, AND THE ERASE/WRITE ALTERNATE (EWA) COMMAND
       NECESSARY TO SWITCH A 3270 SCREEN INTO ITS ALTERNATE AND
       USUALLY LARGER SCREEN SIZE.

       THIS USERMOD ADDS SUPPORT TO VTAM FOR THE WSF AND EWA COMMANDS
       FOR LOCAL NON-SNA 3270 TERMINALS ONLY.  THE RELEVANT COMMAND
       CODES (X'7E' FOR EWA AND X'F3' FOR WSF) HAVE NON-ZERO ENTRIES
       INSERTED INTO THE TRANSLATE TABLE OF THE 3270 SEND/RECEIVE LOCAL
       TRANSLATION CONTROLLER ISTZBF0L WHICH ARE DECODED BY THE 3270
       LOCAL WRITE CCW PROCESSOR ISTZBFBA SO THAT THE CORRECT CCW
       OPCODES ARE SET.

   SPECIAL CONDITIONS:
     ACTION:
       A "CLPA" MUST BE PERFORMED AT IPL TIME FOR THIS SYSMOD TO
       BECOME ACTIVE.
     DOC:
       WSF AND EWA ARE NOW VALID VTAM WRITE COMMANDS FOR LOCAL NON-SNA
       3270 TERMINALS.  IT IS UP TO THE VTAM APPLICATION TO DETERMINE
       IF THE USE OF EITHER OF THESE COMMANDS IS APPROPRIATE FOR THE
       3270 HARDWARE (OR EMULATION(S) THEREOF) INVOLVED.

   COMMENTS:
     PRYCROFT SIX P/L PUBLIC DOMAIN USERMOD FOR MVS 3.8 NUMBER 8.
       THE ZAP DOES NOT VERIFY THAT THE TRANSLATE TABLE ENTRIES BEING
       REPLACED ARE NULL, SO THIS USERMOD CAN BE REAPPLIED IF NECESSARY.

     THE FOLLOWING MODULES AND/OR MACROS ARE AFFECTED BY THIS USERMOD:
