                             DSSDUMP

Enclosed is a preliminary version of the DSSDUMP program, complementing
DSSREST, for users who do not have access to ADRDSSU.

JCL:     install the load library as a separate PDS (due to size and
           many anticipated changes, it should not be copied to an
           existing PDS.

         Add the PDS name (and volser) to your IEAAPFnn authorization
           facility member in SYS1.PARMLIB. Ensure that all entries
           other than the last have a continuation comma. Then IPL
           to make the addition effective.

     //dump     JOB  ...per local specifications...
     //         EXEC PGM=DSSDUMP,REGION=4096K,TIME=20
     //STEPLIB   DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=....PDS containing DSSDUMP....
     //SYSPRINT  DD  SYSOUT=*  (normally FBA, 133, but VBA supported)
     //TAPE      DD  DISP=(,KEEP),UNIT=tape,VOL=SER=...,DSN=....
     //*    see application notes on DCB options
     //SYSIN     DD  *       control cards

Controls (free format using columns 1-72):

       * comments

       DUMP name.or.mask    * dump by catalog lookup

       DUMP name.or.mask    VOL(serial)  * use specified pack only

       SELECT or INCLUDE may be used instead of DUMP

       EXCLUDE name.or.mask  * skip matching data sets from the prior
       *  specification.

       TEST    bypass output processing; generate statistics only

       ALLDATA (or ALLEXCP)  dump all allocated tracks; otherwise
               only used tracks are dumped for sequential and
               partitioned data sets.

       PREFIX  index.
       RENAME  oldindex.  newind.
       REPLACE oldind.    newindex.levels.
       STRIP   oldind.
               PREFIX prepends the specified index level (1-22 chars)
               to each data set name. RENAME/REPLACE remove the old
               level (1-22 chars) and replace it by the new one. STRIP
               removes the specified string. Names exceeding 44 chars
               will be truncated, and all names are checked for
               duplicates. Limit 1 PREFIX or 16 RENAME/REPLACE/STRIP.

       OPTIONS flag1 flag2 flag3 .....
               This card allows setting one or more run options.
               TEST inhibits writing output, but has already opened
                 the TAPE output file.
               ALLDATA or ALLEXCP - writes all allocated tracks, even
                 if not used
               ENQUEUE protects data set from changes during the dump,
                 and bypasses if the data set is not available.
                 (NOT YET IMPLEMENTED)
               EXPORT indicates output will go to another installation,
                 and results in resetting flags (RACF, Password, and
                 expiration date).
               DEBUG - not implemented

Note that any number of dump/select/include statements may be used.
Exclude statements apply only to the previous dump request, and are
currently limited to 16 (assembly option). Reserved words may be
abbreviated to three characters (SEL for SELECT, ALL for ALLDATA, etc.)

A name entry is considered a mask when it contains at least one
asterisk or question mark/percent sign. A name with a trailing period
is also a mask, and has ** appended. Masks are either data set name
oriented (e.g., HERC01.TEST.** dumps all data sets with beginning with
HERC01.TEST., HERC01.TEST.* dumps only data sets with one additional
level, etc.), or positional. A positional mask is defined by having
at least one percent sign, also doubling as a general match character.
A question mark matches all characters other than period and blank.
Two asterisks terminate the compare with a match.

At present there are some limitations:

Catalog locate may not return the correct name of a data set with an
alias, so these will be ignored. Use the VOL(...) option with the
true name to dump these. I've also had incomplete catalog data returned
when the catalog contains a GDG (GDG processes, but not other data).

Names selected by serial may be duplicates, and are not supported by
ADRDSSU. To bypass the problem, these data sets are qualified by
appending .D#nnnnnn to create a unique name.

The number of data sets processed in one dump varies; the maximum
number is 65504 divided by the sum of (each name length+45), being
just over 700 if all names are 44 bytes.

Data sets are skipped if they are not currently supported. This
includes any DSORG other than PS, PO, and DA (DA may not get restored
correctly). New data set types (HFS, PDS/E) have a zero LSTAR value
and are skipped because they appear empty. Also multi-volume data
sets are not currently processed.

Running time is approximately 1 CPU minute, 2 elapsed, on a 2GHz CPU
per output tape.
The TAPE DD may be omitted, or specify a device other than tape or
disk. In that case it is ignored, and the program runs in TEST mode
(performs all processing other than writing dump tape). The TAPE DD
may also specify a sequential DASD data set; for DASD the default
block size is reduced to half-track (modulo disks) or full-track (older
DASD). Note that RECFM=V(B) is supported for TAPE and DASD output;
it creates one record per block, with BDW and RDW, and may be useful
when transferring the file to different systems (e.g., with ftp). The
file may be rendered usable by running IDCAMS recfm V to U conversion.

The program may be invoked by another, provided it is authorized. The
caller may provide a DDNAME override list to replace, in order, SYSIN,
SYSPRINT, and TAPE. R1 points to a PARM address, then X'80'+DDN list
address. The DDN list has a half-word length, and up to 3 CL8 name
fields. A blank or hex zero name is not replaced. Valid lengths are 2,
10, 18, and 26 (length of length included).
