                      SXMACLIB Overview

This macro library is mainly intended to provide support for the
instructions emulated by loading the Hercules S37X module when running
in S/370 mode. For more information, please see the $$S37X member.

To allow the structured programming macros provided with the original
TK3 system to utilize the additional S37X instructions, changes
were required to the structured programming macros. In general these
changes should be transparent to the user. A few additional features
have been implemented in the structured programming macros. These new
features along with the capabilities provided by the original macros
are fully documented in the $$SPDOC member.
