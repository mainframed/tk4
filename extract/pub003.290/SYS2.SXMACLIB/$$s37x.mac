This library provides macros which generate code for the z/Architecture
instructions provided by the Hercules S37X module when assembling with
the IFOX00 assembler. It is based on the SIMZ9 macro library created
by Tom Armstrong in support of the SIMZ9 simulator. Those macros are
included in this library, as the SIMZ9 instructions are a subset of
those provided by S37X.

Notes:
1. Displacement values are limited to a maximum of 12 bits. Instructions
   with 20-bit displacement values will contain zeroes in the high-order
   8 bits (DH field).
2. The second operand of SS-f format instructions (e.g. PKA, PKU)
   must be coded as a symbolic value without an explicit length. This
   restriction arises from the fact that the 8-bit length field in SS-f
   format instructions applies to the second operand, as opposed to the
   first operand in S/360 SS format instructions (e.g. MVC).
3. For instructions containing relative address references (e.g. CHRL),
   the relative address operand may not be a literal.
