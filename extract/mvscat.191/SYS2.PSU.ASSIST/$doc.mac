How to install Assist on your system:

Read member ASDISTRB for full install directions if you want to
install from scratch.


Fasttrack:

All parts of ASSIST with generous default options have been completed
for you and the resultant object code from assembling ASSIST is
included in this library along with original distribution files from
PSU.

As a result, all that needs to be done is to edit the member ALINK
and submit it on your system.  This will link-edit ASSIST to the
load library you specify using the pre-assembled object decks here.



Testing:

The member @TEST provides a sample PROC (internally) and JCL to
invoke ASSIST and has a program which will test that ASSIST works
minimally.  To do full testing, after reading the userguide (ASUSERGD
or AUSERGD), submit @TEST substituting ASTEST01 through ASTEST05 as
input to the interpreter.
For example, using @TEST, delete everything from the //SYSIN DD down
and replace //SYSIN DD with:
//SYSIN  DD  DSN=thispds(ASTEST01),DISP=SHR
to run test suite number 01.
You'll want to run all five of the test suites.

Also included are members ESAxxxx which will are tailored for
installing ASSIST using standard PROCs in an MVS/ESA environment
with HLASM.


Documentation:

For distribution on the CBT Tape the manual has been added in member
$MANUAL.  This is the ASSIST INTRODUCTORY ASSEMBLER USER'S
MANUAL dated "ASSIST1-1 3.0/B MARCH 1974"
