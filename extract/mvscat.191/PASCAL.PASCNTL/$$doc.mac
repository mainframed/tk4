This collection of PASCAL libraries was picked up by me in the
seventies, but I don't recall where from (possibly one of the SHARE
groups). The original version failed on anything larger than 3330s,
and got 0C4s under MVS. The SRC and UTIL libraries contain the original
source, and the CNTL library contains my fixes. The OBJ and LIB files
contain modules with my changes, and have been tested on MVS 3.8j
under Hercules. The P-code processor may be protected (free to use,
but not modify), but much of my documentation disappeared in the
interim. To begin, install the PASPROCS procedures in your preferred
PROCLIB. Job RUNTEST is a sample run to verify proper installation.
The PASxxx procedures provide basic PASCAL execution, and the PAXxxx
procedures additionally provide a cross-reference listing.
Other jobs in this PDS were jobs I used to create the modified version
of the code.

Problems and questions may be reported to Gerhard Postpischil at

but I don't use PASCAL, and at best may only be able to help with the
MVS interface.
