21 DEC 82  NOTE -  IT IS POSSIBLE FOR THE SYSTEM TO GENERATE S0C1
                   OR S0C9 ABENDS DURING THE DD COMMAND.  IF THIS
                   HAPPENS, CHECK THE LINKEDIT TO SEE IF THE LENGTH
                   OF THE FINDPDDB ROUTINE (OR ANY OTHER MODULE) IS
                   ZERO.  IF IT IS, RELINK QUEUE WITH AN EXPLICIT
                   INCLUDE CARD FOR THE MODULE.
                   THE PROBLEM IS THAT SOMEWHERE THERE IS A CSECT CARD
                   WITH THE WRONG NAME ON IT.  IN THIS CASE, MODULE
                   CPDDB HAD A FINDPDDB CSECT CARD IN IT INSTEAD OF THE
                   PROPER ONE (CPDDB).  IT HAS BEEN FIXED AS OF
                   23 DEC 82, BUT THERE ARE PROBABLY OLD VERSIONS OUT
                   THAT STILL HAVE THE PROBLEM.

24 JAN 83  PLACED ON JES2 MODS TAPE SP-009.

15 FEB 83  UF083 - CHANGE TGPS COMMAND TO ALSO LIST THE NUMBER OF JOBS
                   THAT HAVE CERTAIN NUMBERS OF TRACK GROUPS ASSIGNED
                   TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO SEE IF THE NUMBER OF BUFFERS
                   IN A TRACK GROUP IS REASONABLE.

20 MAR 83  NOTE -  FOR THE QUEUE COMMAND TO SET QXAUTH BASED UPON
                   THE USER HAVING THE TSO OPER FLAG SET, IT IS
                   NECESSARY FOR THE COMMAND TO BE INVOKED AS A TSO
                   COMMAND, NOT VIA CALL.
                   THIS IS BECAUSE THE CODE ASSUMES THAT UPON ENTRY
                   R1 IS POINTING TO THE CPPL, AND THE CALL ENVIRONMENT
                   DOES NOT SET THINGS UP IN THIS WAY.  NO CHECKING IS
                   DONE TO VERIFY THE ENVIRONMENT UPON ENTRY, OR EVEN
                   IF THE FIELDS POINTED TO BY R1 ARE EVEN IN THE
                   ADDRESSABLE REGION.

29 APR 83  PLACED ON JES2 MODS TAPE SP-011.
