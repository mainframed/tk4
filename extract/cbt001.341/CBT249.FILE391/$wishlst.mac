WISH LIST FOR FUTURE WORK.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

FILE FORWARD / FILE BACKWARD COMMANDS.
  L * +/- IS ALMOST IT, BUT WOULD BE EASIER WITH FF/FB

COMMAND TO PRINT CURRENT DATASET WITH OPTIONS FOR DEST/CLASS/FORMS.
  ALSO OPTION TO LIMIT TO RANGE OF LINES.
  SPIN COMMAND COVERS MOST OF IT - JUST NEED TO ADD OPTIONS.

ALLOW QUEUE TO WORK ON A SYSTEM WITH REMOVED SPOOL VOLUMES.

ALLOW SPECIFICATION OF ALTERNATE PREFIX FOR DATASET NAMES.

CHANGE PF-KEY DEFINITIONS TO ALLOW FOR 24 KEYS.
  RIGHT NOW THE SYSTEM MAPS 13-24 INTO 1-12, BUT IT MIGHT BE NICE TO
  ALLOW UNIQUE DEFINITIONS FOR 13-24.

PICK UP SYSTEM ID'S FROM QSE'S IF THE FIELDS IN QCOMMON ARE BLANKS.
  THIS WILL ALLOW USERS TO CONTINUE TO SPECIFY "USER FRIENDLY"
  SYSTEM NAMES IF THEY SO DESIRE, BUT THE REST OF US WILL BE ABLE TO
  JUST LET IT RUN WITH THE SMFID'S.  (ONE FEWER THING TO HAVE TO
  MODIFY TO GET THE SYSTEM RUNNING.)

JCLERROR COMMAND THAT LOOKS AT JOB MESSAGES AND LISTS LINES THAT
  START WITH IEF BUT ARE NOT THE IEF MESSAGE FOR SUBSTITUTION JCL.

NOTE:  USERS WITH ACF2 RELEASE 3.1.3 AND JES2 SP1.3 WILL HAVE PROBLEMS
  WITH THE ASSEMBLY FAILING DUE TO MOVED AND DELETED FIELDS IN CONTROL
  BLOCKS.  FOR THE TIME BEING, YOU ARE ON YOUR OWN.  IF YOU GET IT
  TO WORK, PLEASE SEND ME A COPY.

ADD HELPS FOR SYSOUT CANCEL REQUEUE DELETE COMMANDS KEYED OFF OF THE
  AUTHORIZED FLAG FOR THOSE USERS THAT MAY WANT TO USE THEM.

POSSIBLE PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT TO USE ACB INTERFACE FOR SPUN OUTPUT
  RATHER THAN DCB.

HAVE INIT CHECK TO SEE IF RUNNING THE RIGHT LEVEL OF THE CODE FOR THE
  VERSION OF JES2 RATHER THAN ABENDING WITH AN 0C4 AT SOME LATER TIME.

PROBLEMS WITH MORE THAN 7 (9) SPOOL VOLUMES?????

TSO COMMAND CAN NOT FIND COMMANDS THAT RESIDE ONLY IN LPA.
  PROBABLY SHOULD USE PLPA SEARCH ROUTINE THEN TRY IDENTIFY WITH ENTRY
  ADDRESS OF ZERO AND NAME OF COMMAND NAME.  RETURN CODE SHOULD BE
  DIFFERENT. IF INVALID ADDRESS, TRY THE BLDL.  IF OTHER RETURN CODE
  IS IN EITHER PLPA OR MLPA, THEN DO ATTACH WITHOUT DE=.
