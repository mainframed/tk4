*               SYSTEM MONITOR PROGRAM (SYSMON)
*
*  DESCRIPTION:
*
*       SYSMON IS A PROGRAM WRITTEN IN ASSEMBLER WHICH FACILITATES THE
*  BROWSING OF CERTAIN CONTROL BLOCKS IN THE OS/VS2 OPERATING SYSTEM BY
*  A LOGGED ON TSO USER.
*
*  INSTALLATION:
*
*       TO INSTALL SYSMON , ASSEMBLE THE PROVIDED SOURCE PROGRAM INTO
*  A LOAD MODULE LIBRARY.
*       DUE TO SYSMONS USE OF SPECIAL MACROS A SPECIAL TYPE OF
*  SYSLIB DD CARD IS REQUIRED DURING ITS ASSEMBLY AS FOLLOWS.
*
*         //SYSLIB   DD DSN=SYS1.MACLIB,DISP=SHR
*         //         DD DSN=SYS1.AMODGEN,DISP=SHR
*         //         DD DSN=SYS1.AMACLIB,DISP=SHR
*
*
*  IMPLEMENTATION:
*
*       TO USE SYSMON FROM TSO OR FROM 6 IN SPF ENTER THE FOLLWING:
*
*           CALL 'LIBNAME(SYSMON)' 'GO'
*
*       THE 'GO' IS REQUIRED PARM INFORMATION TO SYSMON WHICH IF
*  NOT SUPPLIED WILL CAUSE SYSMON TO RETURN CONTROL BACK TO THE CALLER
*  WITHOUT EXECUTING.
*
*       THE FOLLWING IS A LIST OF VALID 1 CHARACTER SYSMON COMMANDS.
*  THESE COMMANDS ARE TYPED IN ROW 1 COLUMN 1 OF THE SCREEN, WHICH
*  IS THE ONLY VALID INPUT AREA DURING SYSMON EXECUTION.
*
*  TYPE 'S' TO STOP (RETURNS TO USER)
*       'A' TO DISPLAY ALL JOBS CURRENTLY EXECUTING
*       'T' TO DISPLAY TSO USERS ONLY
*       'B' TO EXCLUDE TSO USERS
*       'C' TO DISPLAY TSO AND NON TSO USERS (JOBS)
*       'I' TO DISPLAY ACTIVE JOBS
*       'O' TO DISPLAY NON ACTIVE JOBS
*       'J' TO DISPLAY ACTIVE AND NON ACTIVE JOBS
*       'Y' TO DISPLAY JOBS ON EXCLUSION LIST
*       'N' TO EXCLUDE JOBS ON EXCLUSION LIST
*
*
*  SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS:
*
*      DURING CERTAIN DISPLAYS SYSMON MAKES USE OF A HIGHLITING
*  FEATURE TO DELINEATE BETWEEN WHICH JOBS ARE IN WAIT STATE OR SWAPPED
*  OUT AND WHICH JOBS ARE ACTIVE.  ACTIVE JOBS WILL BE INTENSIFIED
*  AS OPPOSED TO THE OTHER TYPES WHICH WILL BE NORMAL.
*
*
*  P. S.
*
*      SYSMON HAS BEEN CALLED "A POOR MANS OMEGAMON."  BY SOME
*  INDIVIDUALS IN THE SYSTEMS STAFF AT OUR INSTALLATION, BUT SINCE
*  IT ALLOWS THE APPLICATIONS PROGRAMMER TO DISPLAY INFORMATION
*  ABOUT JOBS OTHER THAN HIS OWN, MANY SYSTEMS PEOPLE FROWN ON ITS
*  USE.
