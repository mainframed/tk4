PROGRAM FUNCTION:
      THIS PROGRAM WILL EXTEND THE NUMBER OF DIRECTORY BLOCKS IN
A PDS BY A 3 BYTE AMOUNT PASSED IN THE PARM FIELD ON THE EXECUTE
CARD.  THIS SAVES THE SCRATCHING AND REALLOCATING OF THE DATA SET.
METHOD OF OPERATION:
      THE FORMAT 1 DSCB IS READ AND A CHECK IS MADE TO INSURE
PARTITIONED ORGANIZATION.  THE FORMAT 4 DSCB IS READ AND THE NUMBER
OF DIRECTORY BLOCKS THAT CAN FIT ON A TRACK IS STORED OFF.  THE
DIRECTORY IS READ, NUMBER OF DIRECTORY BLOCKS IS COUNTED AND NOTE IS
MADE OF END OF DIRECTORY.  THE END OF THE NEW DIRECTORY IS CALCU-
LATED AND ANY MEMBERS OF THE PDS THAT ARE IN THE NEW DIRECTORY AREA
ARE MOVED UNTIL THAT AREA IS CLEARED.  ALIASES ARE NOTED AND A STOW
REPLACE IS DONE FOR THEM ALSO.  ALL LOAD MODULES THAT HAVE A NOTE
LIST ARE READJUSTED TO REFLECT THEIR NEW LOCATION IN THE PDS.  THE
DIRECTORY IS NOW EXTENDED BY THE NUMBER OF BLOCKS SPECIFIED.
NOTE:
      AT THIS TIME THERE IS NO SUPPORT FOR UPDATING A SCATTER
TRANSLATE TABLE IN A MOVED MEMBER IF THAT MEMBER WAS LINK-EDITED
WITH THE SCATTER LOAD ATTRIBUTE (I.E. IEANUC01).
