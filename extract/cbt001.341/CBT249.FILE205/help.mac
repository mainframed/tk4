             CLASS IF EITHER FCB OR CHARS IS SPECIFIED.
  DEFAULTS - CLASS(1), COPIES(1), ROUTE('SYSTEM DEFAULT'),
             LINESIZE(133), LINECOUNT(83),
             NOPAGE AND INDEX WHEN PRINTING A PDS,
             HEADING WHEN INPUT DOES NOT HAVE ASA CONTROL CHARACTERS,
             NOHEADING WHEN INPUT DOES   HAVE ASA CONTROL CHARACTERS
  ALIAS    - NONE
  NOTES    - IF THE FULLY QUALIFIED DATA SET NAME IS SPECIFIED, IT MUST
             BE ENCLOSED IN SINGLE QUOTES. IF THE DATA SET NAME IS NOT
             ENTERED WITHIN QUOTES, THE USERID IS ALWAYS APPENDED TO
             THE LEFT OF THE NAME.
           - TO PRINT A SINGLE MEMBER OF A PARTITIONED DATASET,
             SPECIFY 'DSNAME(MEMBERNAME)' AS THE FIRST OPERAND.
           - THE SEARCH ARGUMENT MUST BE ENCLOSED IN APOSTROPHES.
           - THE OPERAND CLASS MAY ALSO BE SPECIFIED AS SYSOUT.
           - THE OPERAND ROUTE MAY ALSO BE SPECIFIED AS DEST.
           - THE OPERAND NOMESSAGES MAY ALSO BE SPEC AS NOMSG.
)O OPERANDS -
))'DSNAME'  - DSNAME IS THE NAME OF THE DATASET TO BE PRINTED.
))HEADING   - SPECIFIES THAT A HEADING IS TO APPEAR ON THE TOP OF EACH
              OUTPUT PAGE.
))NOHEADING - SPECIFIES THAT A HEADING IS NOT TO APPEAR ON THE TOP OF
              EACH OUTPUT PAGE. THIS IS NECESSARY WHEN PUNCHING CARDS
              OR PRINTING DATASETS THAT CONTAIN CARRIAGE CONTROL (ASA)
              CHARACTERS.
))HOLD   - OUTPUT IS TO BE PLACED IN HOLD STATUS.
))CLASS('CLASS')   - THE OUTPUT CLASS (SYSOUT CLASS) TO BE USED.
))COPIES('NUMBER') - NUMBER OF COPIES OF SYSOUT DATASET TO BE PRODUCED.
                     MAXIMUM NUMBER OF COPIES IS 255.
))DEST('LOCATION') - LOCATION TO WHICH PRINT WILL BE ROUTED.
                     ('ROUTE' MAY BE USED INSTEAD OF 'DEST')
))FUNC('FUNCTION') - IF THE SYSOUT DATASET IS TO BE PUNCHED CARDS,
                     FUNC(I) WILL SPECIFY INTERPRETING.
))PAGE   - SPECIFIES THAT EACH MEMBER OF A PDS WILL BEGIN ON A NEW PAGE
))NOPAGE - SPECIFIES THAT EACH MEMBER OF A PDS WILL NOT BEGIN ON A NEW
           PAGE.
))INDEX   - A PAGE INDEX IS TO BE PRODUCED FOR A PDS.
))NOINDEX - NO PAGE INDEX IS TO BE PRODUCED.
))NOMESSAGES - FOR A PDS LISTING, NO MESSAGE IS TO APPEAR ON THE TSO
               TERMINAL AFTER PROCESSING EACH MEMBER.
))LINESIZE - SPECIFIES THE OUTPUT LINESIZE WHERE  121<= LINESIZE <=205.
             HAS NO EFFECT IF NOHEADING SPECIFIED. LINESIZE MUST BE
             1 GREATER THAN RECORD SIZE TO ALLOW FOR ASA CHARACTER.
))LINECOUNT - SPECIFIES THE NUMBER OF LINES PRINTED PER PAGE.
              NOTE: LINECOUNT CANNOT EXCEED THE JES2 DEFAULT.
              NOTE: LINECOUNT INCLUDES THE 2 HEADING LINES (UNLESS NOH)
))FCB   - ALLOWS FOR SPECIFICATION OF AN FCB.
))CHARS - ALLOWS FOR SPECIFICATION OF A CHARACTER SET (OR UCS).
))SELECT - FOR A PDS LISTING, ALLOWS FOR SELECTING SPECIFIED MEMBERS.
           A LIST OF MEMBER NAMES SEPARATED BY BLANKS OR COMMAS IS THE
           ACCEPTED FORMAT (I.E. SELECT(MEMBERX MEMBERY MEMBERA) ).
))RANGE  - USED TO SPECIFY A RANGE OF MEMBERS TO BE PRINTED FROM A PDS.
           THE RANGE MAY BE GENERIC (I.E. RANGE(A:C) - WILL CAUSE ALL
           MEMBERS THAT BEGIN WITH A,B, OR C TO BE PRINTED).
))START - SPECIFIES THE RECORD FOR WHICH PRINTING IS TO START. WILL
          APPLY TO ALL MEMBERS OF A PDS.
))COUNT - SPECIFIES THE NUMBER OF RECORDS TO BE PRINTED. MAY BE USED
          WITH THE START OPTION (I.E. START(5) COUNT(10) - WILL PRINT
          10 RECORDS STARTING WITH RECORD 5). WILL APPLY TO ALL
          MEMBERS OF A PDS.
))VOLUME - SPECIFIES THAT DATASET TO BE PRINTED RESIDES ON THIS VOLUME.
           IF VOLUME IS SPECIFIED, UNIT MUST ALSO BE SPECIFIED.
))UNIT   - SPECIFIES VALID UNITNAME IF VOLUME IS SPECIFIED. MUST BE
           SPECIFIED IF VOLUME IS SPECIFIED.
))SEARCH - SPECIFIES THAT ONLY LINES CONTAINING THIS SEARCH ARGUMENT
           ARE TO BE PRINTED. OPTIONALLY, THE SEARCH ARGUMENT MUST
           START IN A SPECIFIED LOCATION BY SUPPLYING THE SECOND
           POSITIONAL PARAMETER - LOCATION.
           NOTE: THE SEARCH ARGUMENT MUST BE ENCLOSED IN APOSTROPHES.
           NOTE: THE MAXIMUM SEARCH ARGUMENT LENGTH IS 256 CHARACTERS.
           EXAMPLE:  SEARCH('THIS IS ARGUMENT')
))LIST   - SPECIFIES THAT EACH RECORD THAT IS PRINTED WILL ALSO BE
           WRITTEN TO THE TSO TERMINAL. NOTE: RECORDS LONGER THAN
           205 BYTES WILL BE TRUNCATED. MAY BE USED WITH SEARCH
           OPTION TO IMMEDIATELY SEE RECORDS FOUND.
