°  This SAS  program is derived from  a program entitled "RMF  Reduction
°  Type 79 for Working Set Statistics Evaluation" from the Connecticut B
°  and Trust tape  that was written by  Bob Widney, County of  Los Angel
°  phone (213)  771-5421 X2723.   Bob used this  program to  facilitate
°  evaluation of an  online environment needing storage  isolation and t
°  to help in the evaluation of the storage isolation parameters.  I gen
°  alized the program for  use at Federal Express with the  intent of mo
°  toring real storage usage and demand page fault rates.

°  The following  reports and  plots are  produced for  each "group".
°  later discussion concerning _GROUP macro):

°   ø From ASD data (subtype 1)
°     ø Plot of time vs. real storage.
°   ø From ARD data (subtype 2)
°     ø List of avg real storage (AVG_RS) and pagein rate (PINRT) by tim
°     ø Plot of time vs. AVG_RS, PINRT and DPIN_SEC.
°   ø From SPGA data (subtype 4)
°     ø Plot of time vs. total page rate, demand page rate, UIC, and AFC

°  In order to make the plots come  out pretty, some rules must be follo
°  in generating the RMF input data:


°    (1) The Monitor II session must be started on a 10 minute boundary.

°    (2) SINTV, ARD, ASD, SPAG, and RECORD must be specified.

°    (3) If the session must be modified later,  do so on a SINTV bounda
°        ry.  Even then the Y-axis on  the plots may be disrupted, bette
°        to not modify the session if possible.


°  I handle this by an automatic command at or before 7:50 AM:
°      $TANNN,T=HH.00,'$VS,''F RMF,S XX,MEMBER(XX)

°  Our SYS1.PARMLIB(ERBRMFXX) member is below:

°      ARD
°      ASD
°      NOOPTIONS
°      RECORD
°      SINTV(300S)
°      SPAG
°      STOP(8H)

°  Other considerations include:


°    (1) //SMFIN  DD statement  contains RMF Type 79 data  stream in tim
°        sequence.

°    (2) Specify installation dependent macros.

°    (3) Ensure that  the arrays are large  enough to contain all  of th
°        'JOBID's  that are  allowed through  the  _SELJOB1 and  _SELJOB
°        macros.   A  'JOBID' is  the  jobname  with the  ASID  appended
°        Currently the  source is set up  for 512 entries  which require
°        about a 500K region.  If this  is exceeded, you will receive th
°        message 'JOBID  TABLE OVERFLOW' in the  SAS LOG and  the progra
°        will continue.


°  MACROS:

°    ø _SELECT :  Used to select at the RMF/SMF header level.  Data
°                 available are SMF79SID and DATETIME.
°    ø _SELJOB1:  Used to select jobs at the ASD (subtype 1) level.  Dat
°                 available are SMF79SID, DATETIME, R791ASID, R791JBN,
°                 R791DMN, R791NPG, and R791PGP.  To bypass further
°                 processing for this job go to SKPJOB_1.
°    ø _SELJOB2:  Used to select jobs at the ARD (subytpe 2) level.  Dat
°                 available ARE SMF79SID, DATETIME, R792ASID, R792JBN,
°                 R792DMN, and R792NPG.  To bypass further processing
°                 for this job go to SKPJOB_2.
°    ø _TITLE  :  Used for report titles.
°    ø _GROUP  :  Used to group jobs for reporting purposes.  For exampl
°                 to group TSO users into a single or multiple groups
°                 rather than reporting on singly.  This macro should
°                 define a variable 'GROUP' to be used later.  Data
°                 available are JOBNAME, ASID, DOMAIN, PERFORM, and
°                 DATETIME.

°  SAS DATASETS CREATED:

°    ø ASD     :  Contains data from the ASD records.  This includes
°                 jobname, ASID, domain, performance group and period,
°                 a timestamp, the RMF interval duration and the number
°                 of read storage frames at the end of the interval.
°    ø ARD     :  Contains data from the ARD records.  This includes
°                 jobname, ASID, domain, performance group, a timestamp,
°                 the RMF interval duration, average real storage, page
°                 seconds, page ins, page ins per CPU second, EXCPs per
°                 second, total EXCPs, and CPU time.  Since many of thes
°                 variables are step and/or transaction based, I have
°                 attempted to validate that the step and/or transaction
°                 were active for the entire RMF interval before using
°                 the reported values.  For example, tha average real
°                 storage reported for a TSO user is that of the current
°                 transaction and cannot be assumed to have been that
°                 value for the entire interval.  This problem makes thi
°                 dataset mostly useless for all but long running tasks.
°                 You will notice that the average real storage is seldo
°                 the same value as the real storage recorded in the ARD
°                 records.  The ASD value is calculated for the entire
°                 interval where the ARD value is simply the count at th
°                 end of the interval.  I have also noticed that
°                 occasionaly the EXCP related variables go negative.

°                 This seems to be due to the halfword counter in the
°                 RMF bucket wrapping.
°    ø SPAG    :  Contains data from the SPAG records.  This includes
°                 a timestamp, the duration of the RMF interval, the
°                 demand paging rate, the total paging rate, the availab
°                 frame count, and the unreferenced interval count.
