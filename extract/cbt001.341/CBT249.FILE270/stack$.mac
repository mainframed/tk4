     STACK is a TSO COMMAND PROCESSOR which enables interception of
 PUTGET IO for the duration of the TSO command following STACK. Thus
 the output from a TSO command may be directed to a dataset. STACK
 imitates the TMP to obtain the next TSO command and attach it with
 the IO redirected via the STACK macro. STACK can be used to
 execute a command from a specific library (for example a test version)
 or to call a program using dynamic linkage since the optional TASKDD
 is also used as the tasklib for the duration of the command.
 VIO datasets may be used for the IO files. All operands are optional.
