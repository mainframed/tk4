  PROGRAM:       NEWWAIT
  AUTHOR:        Kermit Kiser
  AGENCY:        WDPSC
  LANGUAGE:      Assembler
  LOCATION:      WDPSC.SHARED.LOAD
  FUNCTION:      Wait for a specified period  of time without using
                 CPU time (replaces WAITER).

  RUN MODE:      Batch or interactive

  NEWWAIT  is a  program  which can  be  called by  a  CLIST or  an
  application program executing under control of  TSO to wait for a
  specified period of time without using  CPU time.  It can be used
  for generating temporary displays.

  To call from a CLIST:
       CALL 'WDPSC.SHARED.LOAD(NEWWAIT)' 'nn'

             nn  =  the number of seconds to halt execution.  The
                    minimum which can be specified is '.01' (one-
                    hundredth second).

  EXAMPLE:  CALL 'WDPSC.SHARED.LOAD(NEWWAIT)' '5'

            Will cause a five second wait before continuing execution.

  To call from a COBOL Program:

       CALL 'NEWWAIT' USING parameter.

       Parameter is a two field data item:  length, time.

            length  =  binary halfword (2 bytes) giving length of
                       parameter not including this length field.

            time    =  time in seconds to wait.  The format is the
                       same as for a CLIST.

  EXAMPLE:

            01 PARAMETER.
               05   LEN   PIC S9999 COMP VALUE +1.
               05   TIM   PIC X VALUE '2'.

       CALL 'NEWWAIT' USING PARAMETER.
            will wait two seconds.

       NOTE:     This  program  can  be  interrupted  by  pressing
                 your attention key (BREAK, PAl, ATTN, etc.).
