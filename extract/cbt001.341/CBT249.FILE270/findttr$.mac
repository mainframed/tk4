    Program FINDTTR is CALLED BY THE FINDTTR CLIST TO SEARCH A PDS FOR A
 GIVEN STRING. THE TTR OF ALL BLOCKS CONTAINING THE STRING IS DISPLAYED
 WHETHER IN DIRECTORY,MEMBERS,GAS, OR BEYOND DS1LSTAR.

    URZAP (K.U) can then be used to point a directory entry to the
 desired TTR location.

    The only advantage of this over PDSGAS (option K.P) might be the
 ability to search beyond DS1LSTAR and find things compressed out.

    The clist syntax is:

        %FINDTTR  dsname

    The clist will prompt for the search string.
