  PROGRAM:       TIMECOND
  AUTHOR:        Linda Luebcke
  AGENCY:        WDPSC
  LANGUAGE:      Assembler
  LOCATION:      WDPSC.SHARED.LOAD
  FUNCTION:      Set a condition code which reflects either the day
                 of the week,  day of the month, Julian  day of the
                 year,  month  of the  year,  or  hour of  the  day
                 depending upon which date or time is specified.

  RUN MODE:      Batch or Interactive

  This program  is intended to  provide information to  control the
  conditional execution  of other  steps in  a jobstream.   It will
  sense the day of  the week, month of the year,  Julian day of the
  year, day of the  month or hour of the day  and set its condition
  code to  a value reflecting the  result.  This value can  then be
  tested in succeeding steps to control whether they are executed.

  To execute this program, code the following:

       //stepname EXEC PGM=TIMECOND,PARM='?'

       ? is:     Blank (or no PARM='?') if you wish to know the day
                      of the week.   Condition Code set is  0-6 for
                      Sunday-Saturday.
                 D    if you  wish to  know the  day of  the month.
                      Condition code set is 1-31.
                 J    if you  wish to  know the  Julian day  of the
                      year.  Condition code set is 1-366.
                 M    if you  wish to know  the month of  the year.
                      Condition code set is 1-12.

                 H    if  you wish  to know  the hour  of the  day.
                      Condition code set is 0-23.

  If an  invalid parameter  value is specified,  the job  step will
  abend with an OC1.

  EXAMPLES:

  1.   Execute program  TUESONLY only  if the  day of  the week  is
       Tuesday:

            //STEP0   / EXEC PGM=TIMECOND,PARM=' '
            //STEPLIB DD DSN=WDPSC.SHARED.LOAD,DISP=SHR
            //STEPX EXEC PGM=TUESONLY,COND=(2,NE,STEP0)

  2.   Execute program  AFTRNOON only  if the time  of day  is past
       noon:

                 //STEP0   / EXEC PGM=TIMECOND,PARM='H'
                 //STEPLIB DD DSN=WDPSC.SHARED.LOAD,DISP=SHR
                 //STEPX EXEC PGM=AFTRNOON,COND=(12,LT,STEP0)

  3.   Execute program PAYDAY only if the  day of the month is 10

            //STEP0   / EXEC PGM=TIMECOND,PARM='D'
            //STEPLIB DD DSN=WDPSC.SHARED.LOAD,DISP=SHR
            //STEPX EXEC PGM=PAYDAY,COND=(10,NE,STEP0)

  4.   Execute program SUMTIMES if the day of the week is Friday or
       if the day of the month is past the 25th of the month:

            //STEP0A EXEC  PGM=TIMECOND,PARM=' '
            //STEPLIB  DD  DSN=WDPSC.SHARED.LOAD,DISP=SHR
            //STEP0B EXEC  PGM=TIMECOND,PARM='D'
            //STEPLIB  DD  DSN=WDPSC.SHARED.LOAD,DISP=SHR
            //STEPX  EXEC  PGM=SUMTIMES,COND=((5,NE,STEP0A),(25,LT,STEP0
