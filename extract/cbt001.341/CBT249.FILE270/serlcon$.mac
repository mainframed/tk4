  PROGRAM:       SERLCONV
  AUTHOR:        Charles J. Wilson
  AGENCY:        Dept. of Labor and Industries
  LANGUAGE:      COBOL
  LOCATION:      WDPSC.SHARED.LOAD
  FUNCTION:      Convert serial dates to standard date format after
                 date validation.

  RUN MODE:      N/A...this is a subroutine.

  This is a subroutine which accepts  a serial date and converts it
  to a standard date  of the form MMDDYY if and  only if the serial
  date  is a  valid  date.  A  serial  date is  of  the form  NNNNN
  representing the displacement from the beginning of the twentieth
  century.   For example  January  1, 1900  is  serial date  00001,
  January 2, 1900  is serial date 00002, January 1,  1901 is serial
  date 00366 (since 1900  was not a leap year), and  so on.  Serial
  dates  are generated  from standard  dates  by program  STOJCONV.
  Thus,  this   program  reverses  the  conversion   that  STOJCONV
  performs.

  HOW TO USE THIS PROGRAM:

  Place the following 01 level into your WORKING STORAGE SECTION:

       01   SERLCONV-I-O-AREA.
            05   FILLER                        PIC X(8).
            05   SERIAL-DATE                   PIC X(5).
            05   STANDARD-DATE                 PIC X(6).
            05   VALID-INPUT                   PIC X(3).

  Do the following in your PROCEDURE DIVISION:

       MOVE your date to be converted TO
            SERIAL-DATE OF SERLCONV-I-O-AREA.
       CALL 'SERLCONV' USING SERLCONV-I-O-AREA.
       If VALID-INPUT NOT EQUAL 'YES'
            do your error routine
       ELSE
            Your date is now in standard format and is available
            in STANDARD-DATE OF SERLCONV-I-O-AREA.
