0Function -
0  The KOMM command is a CLIST communication routine for 3270 terminals.
 It is for use within CLISTs to give simple applications control over
 the formatting capabilities of the 3270 type terminals.

-Operands -
0 Required - None.
-  WCC(char) -    char is the write control character to be used
                  (see a 3270 programming guide for description).
                  'C' is the default if this operand is not used.
0  RESET(line) -  line is the line you wish the line count to be set to.
                  Normal output (non-fullscreen) will begin at this line
                  line defaults to '1' if the subfield is omitted.
0  CLEAR -        Causes the 3270 screen to be cleared.
0  MESSAGE(row,col,'mess') -
                  Displays a message on the 3270 screen. "row,col" is
                  where the message begins. "mess" is the message to be
                  displayed. A "о" in the message must appear as "оо"
                  (See "message-note" below).
0  CURSOR(row,col) -
                  This causes the cursor to move to the given location.
                  An alternate name for this operand is IC(row,col).
0  READTO(var) -  This requests the command to obtain a reply and place
                  it in the CLIST variable "var". The variable must
                  be initialized with a data field at least as large
                  as the reply you may obtain.
0  AI -           This operand tells the command not to remove the
                  leading SBA sequence from the input buffer.

-Example -
0 If you enter the following command on a 3270 terminal:
0  KOMM CLEAR MESS(10,40,'о#bbZ')
0 where bb indicates two spaces for the RA address, the screen will be
  cleared, then all positions from column 40 of line 10 to the bottom
  of the screen would be filled with the letter "Z".

-Return-codes note--> KOMM return codes are as follows:
- WRITE operation only return codes-
0   ____________________________________________________________________
0              0 - normal completion
             256 - parse error occured
           other - I/O error occured
    ____________________________________________________________________
0
- READ operation return codes - The return code, if a read operation
      was requested, normally indicates which transmit key was pressed:
0   ____________________________________________________________________
0    241 - PF1        193 - PF13             1 - TEST REQ

     243 - PF3        195 - PF15           125 - ENTER
     244 - PF4        196 - PF16          2048 - PA1 (Followed by ENTER)
     245 - PF5        197 - PF17
     246 - PF6        198 - PF18
     247 - PF7        199 - PF19

     124 - PF12        76 - PF24
    ____________________________________________________________________
0        Other read return codes are:
0            256 - parse error occured
             260 - CLIST variable-name not found
           other - I/O error occured

-Message note--> In order to give the user more control over the
         3270 screen format, KOMM scans the message line and upon
         encountering a "о" (cent symbol) , removes the "о" from
         the message and translates the following character to a
         3270 control character or a TSO problem character, using
         the table given below:
    ____________________________________________________________________
0        3270 control characters           TSO problem characters
        char   translation   hex          char   translation   hex
         _         IC        13            <          (        4d
         -         SBA       11            >          )        5d
         О         SF        1d            "          '        7d
         *         NULL      00            /          ^        5f
         #         RA        3c            о          о        4a

         .         PT        05            B          ,        6b
    ____________________________________________________________________
0           Others should not be considered as defined at this time,
         but are generally translated to themselves. The problem
         characters are translated because, while all 3270 characters
         are used in screen address specification, some have special
         significance to TSO and cannot be used in the command.
