  CLIST:              FIREUP
  AUTHOR:             Jeff Sprehn
  AGENCY:             WDPSC
  FUNCTION:           Allocate  user SPF  Dialog Manager  libraries
                      ahead of the SPF Program Development Facility
                      libraries  and/or  to allocate  libraries  to
                      Dialog Manager DDNAMES not already allocated.

  TERMINAL TYPE: 3270 type only


  This CLIST will allocate for you ANY  OR ALL of the following SPF
  Dialog Manager libraries:
       Panel library
       Message library
       Skeleton library
       Table input library
       Table output library
       File tailoring output library
       SPF link library

  The format of this command is as follows:

       FIREUP PANEL (dataset name of panel library) -
              MESSAGE(dataset name of message library) -
              SKELETON(dataset name of skeleton library) -
              TABLEIN(dataset name of table input library) -
              TABLEOUT(dataset name of table output library) -
              TAILOUT(dataset name of file tailoring output) -
              SPFLOAD(dataset name of SPF link library) -
              PRINT(alloc notification)

       'alloc notification' enter 'YES' if you wish the CLIST
            to write out a one line message for each library
            to be allocated stating that the allocation was
            successful or enter 'NO' if you do NOT wish this
            to take place.

  EXAMPLE #1
  __________

       Allocate  a  panel library  called  "AGNCY999.PANEL.LIB",  a
       message  library called  "AGNCY999.MESSAGE.LIB",  and a  SPF
       link library  called "AGNCY999.SPF.LOADLIB"  (User's PROFILE
       PREFIX  is  XX00999  and  user   does  not  want  allocation
       notification messages).

            FIREUP PANEL('''AGNCY999.PANEL.LIB''') -
                   MESSAGE('''AGNCY999.MESSAGE.LIB''') -
                   SPFLOAD('''AGNCY999.SPF.LOADLIB''') -
                   PRINT(NO)

  EXAMPLE #2
  __________

       Allocate  a panel  library  called "XX00999.SPF.PANELIB",  a
       message library called "XX00999.SPF.MSGLIB",  and a skeleton
       library called "XX00999.SKELETON.LIB" (User's PROFILE PREFIX
       is  XX00999  and  user  does  want  allocation  notification
       messages).

            FIREUP PANEL (SPF.PANELIB) -
                   MESSAGE(SPF.MSGLIB) -
                   SKELETON(SKELETON.LIB) -
                   PRINT(YES)




1                                                        FIREUP.3
                                                         06/25/82


  This CLIST must be placed in one of the following:

       .    Inside a CLIST executing in  "straight TSO" (outside of
            SPF).

       .    Inside      a     LOGON      PROCEDURE     such      as
            PREFIX.MISC.CLIST(LOGON) for PRODl users.

  The  Dialog Manager  libraries  cannot  be allocated  within  SPF
  (Option '6') because the concatenation  will fail because the SPF
  Program  Development Facility  libraries  are  OPEN and  are  not
  CLOSED until you exit SPF.
