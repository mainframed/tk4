  PROGRAM:       FINDMEM
  AUTHOR:        Jeff Sprehn
  AGENCY:        WDPSC
  LANGUAGE:      Assembler
  LOCATION:      WDPSC.SHARED.LOAD
  FUNCTION:      Subroutine  to be  called by  high level  language
                 program to  determine whether  a specified  member
                 exists in a given PDS data set.

  RUN MODE:      Batch or Interactive

  This program is a subroutine  which dynamically allocates the DSN
  passed to it and then searches the directory to determine whether
  the member name passed to it exists or not.

  To call this program from a COBOL program, do the following:

  If your dataset IS cataloged:
       MOVE your dataset name
            TO DSNAME OF FINDMEM-I-O-AREA.
       MOVE your member name
            TO MEMBER-NAME OF FINDMEM-I-O-AREA.
       CALL 'FINDMEM' USING FINDMEM-I-O-AREA.

  If your dataset is NOT cataloged:

       MOVE your dataset name
            TO DSNAME OF FINDMEM-I-O-AREA.
       MOVE  your member name
            TO MEMBER-NAME OF FINDMEM-I-O-AREA.
       MOVE your volume serial number
            TO VOL-SER-NO.
       CALL 'FINDMEM' USING FINDMEM-I-O-AREA
                            VOL-SER-NO.

            05   OP-SYS VALUE 'VS'   PIC X(2).
            05   MEMBER-NAME         PIC X(8).
            05   DSNAME              PIC X(44).
            05   SUCCESS-INDICATOR   PIC 99.
       01   VOL-SER-NO     PIC X(6).
