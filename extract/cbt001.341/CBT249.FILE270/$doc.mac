*                             25 State Office Bldg Two, OB-01
*                             Olympia, Washington 98504
*
*
*     The purpose of this tape is to transfer some of WDPSC's local
*   utilities. All this stuff works here, but we don't guarantee it
*   to work anywhere else. Some programs may need modification for
*   an installation. Some are good only as "HOWTO" samples.
*
*     This tape contains the WDPSC programs which were released in
*   CBT files 270-274. Two of those programs, named FTL and KOMM, have
*   been modified and the latest versions are on this tape.
*
*     We do not have TSO EXTENSIONS or XA yet. Some programs may
*   need to be modified for these system levels.
*
*     MANY OF THE TSO COMMANDS USE THE SETVAR SUBROUTINE.
*   You will need to assemble SETVAR before these commands will work
*   CORRECTLY, THIS PROGRAM IS LINKED WITH AN IBM MODULE.
*
*     If a utility has documentation which is maintained separately,
*   the document is in the source PDS with a similiar name but ending
*   with the "$" character.
*
*  To create the necessary MACLIB, CLIST, PROCLIB, etc libraries:
*      Modify and submit either member REDIST or REDISTI which are in
*      this library.  (Use REDIST if program PDSLOAD from the CBT tape
*      is available, else use job REDISTI.)  REDIST or REDISTI will
*      create the MACLIB, CLIST, PROCLIB, PANELS, SKELS, MESSAGES, TEXT,
*      and PARM libraries from the appropriate members in this library.
*
******** NOTE: CLISTs should be copied to a VB dataset after reloading.

*                       functions. We use it as Tech Services option
*                       K.N here. Good if you have multiple master and
*                       user catalogs like we do. Change cat names in
*                       the CLIST.

*                       TASKDD  - DDNAME THE COMMAND SHOULD BE
*                                        ATTACHED FROM IF DESIRED
*                       LIST    - MEANS DISPLAY THE COMMAND ON THE

*                       the SUPERZAP vanilla cards. It allows a dataset
*                       to be renamed or scratched with no ENQ
*                       contention even if the dataset name is allocated
*                       to another job. It also allows a format one DSCB
*                       to be dumped or zapped without knowing the CCHHR
*                       address in the VTOC.
*
*  SYSOUT     TSO CMD   Command to allocate sysout files using the

*                       year, etc for conditional execution of steps.
*
*  UNCLIB     CLIST     DEALLOCATE (REMOVE) A PRIVATE CLIST
*                       LIBRARY PREVIOUSLY ALLOCATED TO YOUR
*                       SESSION.
*

*
*  VSAMSCAN   PROGRAM   Reads catalog and writes IDCAMS uncatalog
*                       cards for all NVSAM datasets which are then
*                       processed by program CATBYVOL. See job in
*                       CATBYVO#. I think DLY260 step is not needed.
*
*  WATDSN     CLIST     Utility to diplay datasets allocated to a given
*             PROGRAM   DDNAME.
*
*  WDPSCXS    PROGRAM   Subroutine called by ISPF dialogs to stack a
*                       command for execution when ISPF terminates.
*                       Used for our option XL (Exit,Logoff). Requires
*                       NEWISPF frontend to work correctly.
*
*  WHATDSN    TSO CMD   RETURN TO THE CLIST THE DSNAME(S) OF THE
*                       DATASET(S) WHICH IS (ARE) ALLOCATED TO
*                       THE DDNAME GIVEN.
*
*  WTORCOND   PROGRAM   Ask operator a question (Y or N) and set
*                       condition code for execution of later steps.
