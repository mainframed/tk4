  EXAMPLE:

    IFALC FILE(SYSPRINT) DATASET(OUT.PRINT)

    NOTE:   IFALC returns a condition code of 0 if any of
            the following conditions are met:

       (1)  The FILE keyword  only is given:  The  ddname specified
            is currently allocated to the TSO session.

       (2)  The  DATASET   keyword  only  is  given:    The  dsname
            specified is currently allocated to the TSO session.

       (3)  Both  the FILE  and DATASET  keywords  are given:   The
            dsname  specified   is  currently   allocated  to   the
            specified ddname.

            IFALC returns  a condition code of  4 if none  of these
            conditions  were  met.   The   condition  code  may  be
            obtained from the CLIST variable &LASTCC.
