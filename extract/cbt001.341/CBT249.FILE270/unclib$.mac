  Example -

       Suppose that the following CLIST libraries are allocated to your
       session such that their member names may be invoked implicitly:
                 AGNCY999.MY.CLIST
                 JD00999.MISC.CLIST
                 WDPSC.MASTER.CLIST
                 USER.CLIST

  Then, further suppose that the following CLIST was entered:

                 UNCLIB 'AGNCY999.MY.CLIST'

  Then, in the shown order, the  following CLIST libraries would be
  allocated to your session after execution of the UNCLIB:

                 JD00999.MISC.CLIST
                 WDPSC.MASTER.CLIST
                 USER.CLIST
