  PROGRAM:       CLRSPFIO
  AUTHOR:        Kermit Kiser
  AGENCY:        WDPSC
  LANGUAGE:      Assembler
  LOCATION:      Located in a "system library".  That is, it can be
                 executed without supplying STEPLIB.
  FUNCTION:      Prevent the  need for an unnecessary  ENTER (three
                 asterisks at bottom of  screen) when attempting to
                 do a Dialog Manager DISPLAY of a panel after doing
                 CLIST WRITE(s).

  RUN MODE:      To be used under SPF only.  Used in Dialog Manager
                 applications.

  This   program  is   useful   when   developing  Dialog   Manager
  applications which  are driven  by CLISTs  when these  CLISTs mix
  CLIST WRITE statements and Dialog Manager panel displays.

  For example, if you prompt for a  variable in a CLIST via a WRITE
  or WRITENR and READ statement and  then issue an ISPEXEC DISPLAY,
  then three  asterisks will  appear at the  bottom of  the screen.
  You will then be required to  hit ENTER before the Dialog Manager
  panel will be displayed.

  This program will eliminate this unnecessary ENTER and the Dialog
  Manager panel  will be displayed  directly.  Place  the following
  code in  your CLIST just prior  to displaying the  Dialog Manager
  panel.

       ISPEXEC SELECT PGM(CLRSPFIO)
