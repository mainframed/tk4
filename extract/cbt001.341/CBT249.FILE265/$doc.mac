                    A JES2 PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS SYSTEM

 The JES2 Performance Analysis System provides a means for a systems
 programmer involved in the maintenance and extension of JES2
 Release SP/2 and SP/3 to obtain information about JES2 performance
 on a dynamic and useful basis in a real world environment.

 The JES2 Performance Analysis System contains four source modules that
 generate two load modules.  One of the modules, called the JES2
 Performance Monitor, is used to gather JES2 performance data and write
 the data into an OS sequential data set.  The other module, the JES2
 Performance Monitor Report Utility, is used to process data from the
 JES2 Performance Monitor and generate a report.

 The Report Utility provides this data:

    o JES2 CPU utilization

    o Time JES2 spent processing a page fault

    o JES2 activity that results in creation of SVRB's and IRB's

    o JES2 usage of SVC's that create SVRB's

    o JES2 PCE utilization

    o Histograms of spool, TP, console, and SMF buffer utilization

    o A histogram of STIMER interval values obtained when the Performanc
      Monitor detected that JES2 was executing the STIMER macro

    o An analysis of PSW addresses to determine areas in JES2 code that
      are frequently used

    o A summary of processor time spent in each JES2 module

             JES2 PERFORMANCE MONITOR DATA COLLECTION ROUTINE

 The JES2 Performance Monitor Data Collection Routine is used to collect
 data from the JES2 address space.  Data collection is performed by
 periodically using the MVS SCHEDULE macro to initiate an SRB routine
 into the JES2 address space.  The SRB routine, coded as part of the dat
 collection routine and moved into SQA during data collection routine
 initialization, collects data from the JES2 HCT, and other areas in JES
 that may be interesting such as buffer utilization information and the
 JES2 RB chain, and returns this data to the primary monitor by using
 branch entry POST to restart the monitor address space.

 The main monitor routine uses the data returned from the SRB routine to
 compute the JES2 module and module offset currently active, and then
 copies the record created by the SRB into an I/O buffer which is
 scheduled for I/O when the buffer has been filled.

 The following JCL is used to initiate the JES2 Performance Monitor Data
 Collection routine:

    See member JES2MON  for a sample of the JCL required.
    Note: Besure the monitor dispatch priority is higher than JES2.

 To return correct JES2 CPU utilization information, the monitor must ru
 at a dispatching priority higher than the JES2 address space.  If
 necessary, the JES2 dispatching priority must be altered to
 DPRTY=(15,14).

 The following default DCB parameters are assigned:

                 DDNAME RECFM LRECL BLKSIZE
                JESDATA   FB    32    3648
                CONFIG    F     32      32

 The default block size of the JESDATA data set has been chosen to allow
 5 records to be written onto a 3350 track.  If the data set is to be
1
 JES2 PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS SYSTEM                               PAGE



 allocated onto a device other than a 3350, the block size can be
 specified as appropriate for the output device.  The monitor will ensur
 the block size is rounded down to the nearest multiple of the logical
 record length.

 The interval value that can be passed to the monitor in the parm field
 is the value used to select the sampling intervals to be used by the
 monitor.  The value is specified in 1/100th second intervals.  For
 example, 10 will cause the monitor to sample JES2 every 10/100th
 seconds, and 100 will cause the monitor to sample JES2 once a second.

                 JES2 PERFORMANCE MONITOR REPORT UTILITY

 The JES2 performance Monitor Report Utility is used to generate a repor
 from the data obtained by the data collection monitor.

 The following JCL is used to run the utility:

    //A       EXEC PGM=report,REGION=256K
    //RPTPRINT DD  SYSOUT=A
    //MONDATA  DD  DSN=monitor.output.data,DISP=SHR
    //CONFIG   DD  DSN=monitor.configuration.data,DISP=SHR
    //SYSOUT   DD  SYSOUT=A
    //SORTLIB  DD  DSN=SYS1.SORTLIB,DISP=SHR
    //SORTWK01 DD  UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(CYL,(1,1))
    //SORTWK02 DD  UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(CYL,(1,1))
    //SORTWK03 DD  UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(CYL,(1,1))

 The contents of the report are pretty much self-explanatory.  The repor
 includes estimates of JES2 active time, paging information, JES2
 processing at other than the primary JES2 RB, a summary of interruptabl
 SVC usage, that is SVC's that create SVRB's and can be interrupted by
 timer interrupts, and PCE usage.  Histograms of JES2 SPOOL, TP, console
 and SMF buffer usage, and STIMER interval values are provided.  Finally
 a summary of JES2 addresses following interrupts is provided so that
 heavily used areas in JES2 can be determined.  A table showing processo
 usage within JES2 modules is then printed, followed a table very
 similiar to the address map table that shows JES2 page fault activity.

                          USING THE ADDRESS MAP

 The Address Map is used to determine heavily used areas in JES2.  A
 complete segment of an address map is shown below:

    512 BYTE      256 BYTE      128 BYTE       64 BYTE       32 BYTE
 RTAM 0616  7% RTAM 0616  6% RTAM 0616  2%
                             RTAM 068E  4% RTAM 0642  2% RTAM 0666  2%
                                           RTAM 068E  1% RTAM 06A0  1%
                                           RTAM 06C0  2% RTAM 06C0  1%
                                                         RTAM 06E4  1%

 The data inserted into the address analysis table is ranges of address
 that use more than 1% of JES2 active time.  The report program supports
 address ranges from 32 to 512 bytes.  The above table shows the complet
 entry for RTAM at offsets 0600 through 07FE.  The first instruction
 offset encountered by the report was at offset 0616, and 7% of JES2
 active time was spent in the range 0600 to 07FE.  Additional entries ar
 printed on the first line only if the offset of the first instruction i
 the range exactly matches the offset of the first instruction in the 51
 byte range which was true for the 256 byte and 128 byte ranges.
 Additional lines are printed as required, and can be considered to
 consist of subranges within the 512 byte range.

                                 MESSAGES

 The following message is generated by the data extraction monitor:

 xx REPLY 'y' TO TERMINATE JES2 PERFORMANCE MONITOR

 EXPLANATION: The JES2 Performance Monitor Data Extract Utility is
   operating.

 SYSTEM ACTION: The JES2 performance monitor will continue operation
   until a correct response is entered.

 OPERATOR ACTION: Reply with a lower case Y to cause the monitor to
   immediately terminate.  Entering a lower case Y in the normal form of
   the short reply format (e.g., xxy) will cause the letter to be
   translated to upper case prior to being transmitted to the monitor.
   short form reply of the form xx'y' will cause a lower case Y to be
   sent to the monitor.

 The following messages are generated by the Report Program:

 UNABLE TO OPEN ddname

 EXPLANATION: The report utility is unable to open the required data set
   defined by the indicated ddname.

 SYSTEM ACTION: The report utility terminates.

 PROGRAMMER RESPONSE: Provide JCL that points to the indicated data sets
   and rerun the job.

 COMMENTS: This message is sent to the operator's console if RPTPRINT is
   not provided.

 UNEXPECTED DATA LENGTH IN MONITOR DATA SET

 UNEXPECTED DATA LENGTH IN CONFIGURATION DATA SET

 JES2 PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS SYSTEM                               PAGE




 EXPLANATION: The report utility confirms that the logical records in th
   monitor and configuration data sets are the length the report program
   is prepared to process.  If they are not, one of the messages above i
   printed.  These messages indicate one of two possible errors:

    1) The MONDATA or CONFIG DD cards are pointing to the wrong data
       sets.

    2) The data collection routine and the report utility are at
       different programming levels.

 SYSTEM ACTION: The report program terminates.

 PROGRAMMER RESPONSE: In the event of the first problem, correct the
   error and rerun the job step.  In the event of the second problem,
   update the report utility so the output data sets from the monitor ar
   at the same level as the input data sets expected by the report
   utility, assemble and link the report utility, and rerun the step.


                               ABEND CODES

 In addition to "normal" OS/MVS system ABEND's, the report utility is
 subject to the following user ABEND's:

 0001

 EXPLANATION: The DCB passed to the HIST subroutine was not OPEN or did
   not have the proper DCB parameters.

 SYSTEM ACTION: HIST terminates with a user 0001 ABEND code.

 PROGRAMMER RESPONSE: There is probably an error in the main report
   module.  Correct the error and resubmit the job.

 0002
1
 JES2 PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS SYSTEM                               PAGE




 EXPLANATION: A constant value passed to HIST was invalid.

 SYSTEM ACTION: HIST terminates with a user 0002 ABEND.

 PROGRAMMER RESPONSE: There is probably an error in the main report
   utility.  Correct the error and rerun the job.

 System 0C1

 EXPLANATION: There are two errors that can be detected by the main
   report utility and which are reported by a System 0C1 ABEND:

    1) A record was returned from sort out of sequence.

    2) An internal table used to hold control blocks about address
       utilization overflowed.

 SYSTEM ACTION: The report utility terminates by attempting to execute a
   illegal instruction.

 PROGRAMMER RESPONSE: In case 1, the error might be an internal error in
   the sort program, but it is more likely to be an error in the report
   utility itself.  Be sure the SORT statement passed to the sort/merge
   utility is valid and corresponds to the DATASECT DSECT record
   defintion.  If it does not, correct the program and rerun the job.
   For case 2, examine the range entries chained from chain headers in
   the ADR table for validity.  If they are valid, increase the size of
   the table defined at RUNTABLE and the end of table pointer defined at
   RUNMAX and rerun the job.

                               RESTRICTIONS

 The JES2 Performance Monitor Data Collection Routine must be authorized
 and reside in an authorized library.  The dispatching priority of the
 Data Collection routine must be higher than the dispatching priority of
 JES2.

 The JES2 Performance Monitor Data Collection program has been tested on
 System/370 168 AP's and UP's , 3033 UP's and the 3081 model D under MVS
 Release  SP/2, and SP/3 .

 Because of the inherrent nature of AP/MP processing, the monitor can
 return different data when it is run on an AP or MP if JES2 is active o
 one CPU and the monitor SRB is run on the other.  The report created by
 the report program will reflect the different data.

 The monitor extracts data only by sampling.  No guarantee of the
 usefulness of the results is possible.  In general, the following
 observations may be valid:

 o The CPU utilization reported by the monitor is lower than the TCB CPU
   utilization for the address space as a whole as reported by RMF.

 o The SVC usage table is limited to those SVC's which create SVRB's and
   which are interruptable.  JES2 provides services that use the STIMER,
   ENQ and DEQ SVC's.

 The JES2 Performance Monitor routine requires that JES2 macros that
 correspond to the JES2 macros used to create the JES2 subsystem being
 monitored be used to assemble the program.

 Information about utilization of Console Message Buffers and SMF buffer
 is aquired by counting the free chain of these two groups of buffers,
 and by subtracting the count of free buffers from the number of buffers
 in the system.  This counting method makes the entire buffer pool, for
 all intents and purposes, part of the working set.  Some users have ver
 large numbers of console message buffers.  The size of an unmodified CM
1
 JES2 PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS SYSTEM                               PAGE   1



 in both JES2 and NJE is 152 bytes.  If you have 100 CMB's, the working
 set will be 15,200 bytes.  If you have 500, and there is at least one
 user with 500, the working set will be 76,000 bytes.

 An SE option is provided in JESMON to indicate that MVS/SE is being
 used.  As distributed, the SE option is enabled.  No attempt has been
 made to assemble or operate the JESMON module with the SE option
 disabled, or to operate the monitor on CPU's without the MVS/SE softwar
 and hardware support.  However, another site has reported successful
 operation of the monitor under MVS without MVS/SE.

                               DISTRIBUTION

 The performance monitor and report utility is distributed on magnetic
 tape.  The tape is unlabelled and contains these files:

    FILE DESCRIPTION
      1   IEBCOPY unloaded source pds

 The PDS created by file 1 contains 6 members:

    DOCUMENT -- This document, prepared for the TSO FORMAT command.
    HIST     -- A module used to generate the histograms of buffer
                utilization.
    JESMON   -- The JES2 Performance Monitor Data Extract Program.
                When assembled, JESMON requires the JES2 macros.
    RECTRK   -- A module used to compute the number of records of a
                specified data length that can fit on a track.
    REPORT   -- The main report program module.
    TNPRINT  -- A program to post process output from TSO FORMAT to
                make the output suitable for a 3800 printer.
    //

                       INSTALLATION CONSIDERATIONS

 The report utility provides two facilities that are disabled by
 physically branching around the function.  The branch instruction at
 label SW1 can be changed to a NOP, in which case the monitor will
 generate one line for each input record which is fully processed that
 enters the utility.  The branch instruction at SW2 can be changed to a
 NOP, in which case the LIMSET routine will be used to set default limit
 for the buffer usage frequency tables based on the values obtained from
 the JES2 configuration data set.

 JES2 PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS SYSTEM                               PAGE   1



 The following modules are used as part of the JES2 Performance Monitor
 System, or are used to prepare the documentation of the system.  The
 material below is a brief users guide for these modules.


                                   HIST

 The HIST subroutine provides a method of generating a histogram.  The
 HIST subroutine provided with the performance monitor was written
 explictly for the requirements of the performance monitor reporting
 function, but it is of general enough value for independent use.

 HIST may be called as follows:

 ----+----1----+----2----+----3----+----4----+----5----+----6----+----7-
 label    CALL  HIST,(OUTDCB,HORZHDR,VERTHDR,VALTAB,LIMTAB,TABSIZ),VL
          ....
 OUTDCB   DCB   RECFM=VBA,LRECL=125,DSORG=PS,DEVD=PM
 HORZHDR  WTO   'HORIZONTAL HEADER PRINTED AT TOP OF HISTOGRAM',MF=L
 VERTHDR  WTO   'VERTICAL HEADER PRINTED AT THE SIDE OF THE HISTOGRAM',
                MF=L
 VALTAB   DC    F'value1,...,value10'
 LIMTAB   DC    F'lower1,upper1,lower2,upper2,...,lower10,upper10'
 TABSIZ   DC    F'10'

 All parameters are required.  HIST confirms that the RECFM and LRECL of
 the output DCB have been coded as shown, and that the DCB is open.  If
 these conditions are not met, HIST abnormally terminates with user ABEN
 code 0001 and a dump.  If the TABSIZ value is not 10, HIST terminates
 with user ABEND code 0002.

 HIST constructs a histogram of 10 vertical bars whose size corresponds
 to the relative values supplied by the 10 values in VALTAB.  The 20
 values supplied in LIMTAB are translated to EBCDIC and are displayed
 below each vertical bar.  If the lower and upper values specified for a
 bar are different, the two values are displayed with leading 0's delete
 and separated by a "-", and centered under the bar.  If the lower and
1
 JES2 PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS SYSTEM                               PAGE   1



 upper values are the same, the single value is displayed with leading
 0's deleted and centered under the bar.  Value combinations that
 generate 11 characters can cause the printed values to run together.  I
 two different values are provided, the largest value that will be
 translated correctly is 99999.  If the two values are the same, the
 value may be 99,999,999,999.


                                  LIMSET

 The LIMSET subroutine, provided as part of the HIST assembly, is used t
 generate a 20 value limit table that can be passed to HIST, and also
 used to generate the frequency tables.

 LIMSET can be called as follows:

 ----+----1----+----2----+----3----+----4----+----5----+----6----+----7-
 label    CALL  LIMSET,(MAXVAL,TABLE),VL
          ....
 MAXVAL   DC    F'maximum value to be generated into table'
 TABLE    DS    20F                 RESULT TABLE

 The values actually placed into the table have been chosen for their
 "intelligence".  The final value actually placed into the table may be
 greater than the maximum value supplied to LIMSET.


                                  RECTRK

 The RECTRK subroutine provides an interface to compute the maximum
 number of fixed length records which may be placed onto a DASD track.
 The code of RECTRK is loosely based on JES2 code that performs the same
 function, but RECTRK supports the use of keyed records.

 RECTRK may be called as follows:

 ----+----1----+----2----+----3----+----4----+----5----+----6----+----7-
1
 JES2 PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS SYSTEM                               PAGE   1



 label    CALL  RECTRK,(OPENDCB,DATALEN,SWITCH,RESULT),VL
          ....
 OPENDCB  DCB   --- any DCB parameters ---
 DATALEN  DC    F'data length of record or record and key'
 RESULT   DC    F'records per track' NUMBER OF RECORDS PER TRACK
 SWITCH   DC    B'00000000'         CONTROL SWITCH
 KEYED    EQU   B'10000000'         IF ON, RECORD IS KEYED

 The DCB provided to RECTRK must be open.  If it isn't, RECTRK returns
 with return code 4.  If the data set pointed to by the DCB is not on
 direct access storage, RECTRK returns with return code 8.


                                 TNPRINT

 The TNPRINT module is used to reformat output from the TSO FORMAT
 command to a format which makes it more suitable for output on a 3800
 printer.

 The input data set for TNPRINT must be created by the TSO FORMAT comman
 by using the PRINT(data-set-name PS) parameter.

 TNPRINT can be invoked by using the following JCL:

    //A       EXEC PGM=tnprint,PARM='paper-width,line-width'
    //INPUT    DD  DSN=data-set-created-by-TSO-FORMAT-command,DISP=SHR
    //OUTPUT   DD  -- any output parameters --

 The paper-width and line-width operands are expressed in terms of
 characters.  The default is '100,72'.

 TNPRINT performs these functions:

    o Each output line is centered on the page in accordance with the
      specifications of the paper width and line width operands.

    o A leading lower case o is translated to the TN bullet (X'AF')

      character.



                          CHANGES FOR RELEASE 3

 The following changes have been made for release 3:

 o Several minor errors have been corrected in the report utility

 o The report utility generates reports about module usage and the page
   fault table

 o The monitor will attempt to monitor the JES2 system that started the
   monitor, rather than just a primary system named JES2.  This feature
   allows poly-JES systems to be monitored.
