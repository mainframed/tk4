THE SP VERSION OF THE QUEUE COMMAND IS OBTAINED BY SPECIFYING
"SYSPARM=((SP))" FOR THE ASSEMBLIES (SEE MEMBER $NERJCL2).
MEMBER QSTART CAN ALSO BE UPDATED TO CHANGE THE DEFAULT FLAG SETTING
TO ELIMINATE THE NEED TO SPECIFY ANY SYSPARM AT ALL.

SEE MEMBER $UFDOC FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE OTHER MODIFICATIONS.

THIS VERSION OF QUEUE WAS DEVELOPED AS IN INTERNAL AID FOR THE DEBUGGING
OF THE NEW JES2 SYSTEM, WHICH NORMALLY RUNS AS A SECONDARY SUBSYSTEM.
IT IS BELIEVED THAT MOST OF THE DISPLAY COMMANDS WORK PROPERLY, WITH THE
EXCEPTION OF STATUS AND DO.  BOTH OF THERE COMMANDS ARE IN MODULE Q20
(SEARCH).  THE PROBLEM WITH THE DISPLAY OUTPUT COMMANDS IS THAT THERE
ARE NOW TWO QUEUES FOR OUTPUT JOES, ONE FOR LOCAL ROUTING, AND THE OTHER
FOR REMOTE ROUTING.  AT THIS TIME ONLY THE LOCAL ROUTING QUEUE IS
PROCESSED.  THE PROBLEM WITH THE STATUS COMMAND SEEMS TO BE THAT THE
COMMAND SKIPS SOME OF THE QUEUES ENTIRELY, BUT THAT SEEMED TO BE A
PROBLEM WITH THE OLD VERSION OF THE COMMAND AS WELL.
IN PARTICULAR, JOBS IN THE OUTPUT QUEUE (NOT HARDCOPY) SEEM TO
BE IGNORED IN ALL ENVIRONMENTS.

THIS VERSION WILL NOT WORK IF ANY OF THE DEFINED SPOOL VOLUMES
ARE NOT AVAILABLE, INCLUDING A SPOOL VOLUME THAT WAS ADDED AND
THEN PURGED AT A LATER TIME.

THERE WAS ONE PROBLEM WITH THE SYSLOG COMMAND CAUSED BY A CHANGE IN
THE WAS THAT SPUN OUTPUT PDDB'S ARE GENERATED.  IT APPEARS THAT A
SPUN SYSOUT WILL NOW HAVE TWO SEPARATE PDDB'S; A NULL ONE IN THE
NORMAL IOT, AND THE TRUE ONE IN A SPIN IOT.  BECAUSE BOTH OF THE
PDDB'S HAVE THE SAME NUMBER, NORMAL QUEUE PROCESSING WOULD LOCATE
THE FIRST ONE, SEE THAT IT WAS NULL, AND INDICATE THAT THE FILE WAS
EMPTY.  CODE HAS BEEN CHANGED IN LISTDS TO CHECK IF THE MTTR FIELD
IS ZERO BEFORE TESTING FOR THE PROPER DATASET ID NUMBER.  ANY PDDB
WITH A ZERO MTTR FIELD WILL BE IGNORED.  THE ONLY POSSIBLE CHANGE
THAT THE USER WILL NOTICE IS THAT THERE WILL BE TIMES WHEN THE OLD
VERSION WOULD INDICATE "DATASET IS EMPTY" WHILE THE NEW VERSION
WILL INDICATE "DATASET ID NOT FOUND".

AT THIS TIME THE FINDPDDB ROUTINE HAS NOT BEEN CHANGED, SO THE
DD COMMAND WILL PROBABLY GIVE SOME INCORRECT INDICATIONS ABOUT
THE STATUS OF SOME SYSOUTS.

A PDDB COMMAND HAS BEEN ADDED THAT WILL DUMP OUT SOME OF THE MORE
RELEVANT INFORMATION ABOUT THE PDDB'S IN GENERAL, OR DUMP OUT
SELECTED ONES IN HEX, TO ASSIST IN FIGURING OUT WHAT IS REALLY
GOING ON.

I WOULD APPRECIATE HEARING FROM ANYONE WHO COMES UP WITH EITHER
ADDITIONAL BUGS OR FIXES TO THE KNOWN ONES.  ALSO, I WILL TRY TO
PASS ON ANY FIXES TO THOSE USERS THAT I AM AWARE OF, SO PLEASE DROP
ME A NOTE IF YOU GET THIS OFF OF ONE OF THE MODS TAPES.
