GDG   - A CLIST WHICH ALLOWS PSEUDO-FULLSCREEN CONTROL OF
        GENERATION DATA GROUPS.  THE CLIST CALLS THE 'ERASE' COMMAND
        PROCESSOR FOR FULL SCREEN EFFECT.  IT CALLS 'HKNGDG02' TO
        PERFORM INDEX BUILDS AND DELETES.  IT CALLS 'HKNGDG01' TO
        PERFORM LISTS AND MODIFICATIONS.
ERASE - A SIMPLE COMMAND PROCESSOR TO CLEAR YOUR TSO SCREEN.  INSTALL
        IN A LINKLIB OR SYS1.CMDPROC.  THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT FOLLOW
        ALL OF IBMS STANDARDS FOR COMMAND PROCESSORS BECAUSE IT IS NOT
        COMPLEX ENOUGH TO NEED THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE.
LINKIN - A MACRO TO PERFORM REENTRANT LINKAGE CONVENTIONS. I'M SURE
        YOU HAVE ONE TOO, BUT I USE THIS ONE IN 'ERASE'
LINKOUT - MACRO TO PERFORM REVERSE OF 'LINKIN'.
REGEQU - A MACRO TO PROVIDE 'RN EQU N' TYPE REQISTER EQUATES FOR
        LAZY PROGRAMMERS LIKE ME.  USED BY 'ERASE'.
HKNGDG01 - A SLIGHTLY MODIFIED VERSION OF GDGCHNGE, FILE 263 ON THE
        CBT TAPE.  GDGCHNGE HAD A SLIGHT PROBLEM IN THAT IF IT WAS
        TOLD TO LIST ENTRIES IN AN EMPTY INDEX, IT WOULD RESET THE
        NUMBER OF GENERATIONS IN THE INDEX!  NOTE THAT THIS PROGRAM,
        AND HENCE THE TWO 'GDG' CLIST FUNCTIONS 'LIST' AND 'CHANGE'
        ONLY SUPPORT OS CVOL GDG STRUCTURES.
        *NOTE* - MY INITIALS 'JCE' ARE IN COLS 73-75 OF THE ADDED CODE
HKNGDG02 - A SIMPLE LINKAGE TO IEHPROGM WHICH SUPPLIES THE 'ADD'
        AND 'DELETE' FEATURES FOR 'GDG'.

SURE HOPE SOMEONE ADDS VSAM GDG CAPABILITY TO GDGCHNGE, NOT TO MENTION
THE NEW CATALOG SUPPORT COMING UP.  WISH I HAD THE TIME.
