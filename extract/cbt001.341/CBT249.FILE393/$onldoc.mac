ONL01 -- CREATED THE &QBGEN GOBAL SET SYMBOL TO CONTROL THE EXPANSION
         OF JES2 AND SYSTEM CONTROL BLOCK DSECTS SEPARATELY FROM THE
         EXPANSIONS OF MACROS WITHIN THE CODE CONTROLED BY &QGEN.  THE
         QPRBGEN MACRO WAS ALSO CREATED FOR THIS PURPOSE.

ONL02 -- CREATED A COMMAND FUNCTION AUTHORIZATION CSECT (MEMBER AUTH)
         AND A MACRO USED TO REQUEST AUTHORIZATION CHECKING (QAUTHCK).
         ALL CODE CONCERNED WITH WHO USES WHICH QUEUE SUBCOMMAND, AND
         ON WHICH JOBS, HAS BEEN MOVED TO THE AUTH CSECT.  SEE THE
         COMMENTS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE AUTH CSECT FOR ADDITIONAL
         INFORMATION.

         THE HELP CSECT WAS REWRITTEN TO ALLOW CONTROL OVER WHO CAN
         LOOK AT HELP INFORMATION FOR WHICH SUB-COMMANDS.  SEE THE
         COMMENTS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE HELP CSECT FOR ADDITIONAL
         INFORMATION.

         CODE WAS ALSO ADDED TO THE INIT CSECT TO VERIFY A TSO
         ENVIRONMENT AND TO VERIFY SOME FIELDS IN THE COMMAND PROCESSER
         PARAMETER LIST (CPPL).  THIS CODE SUPERCEEDS THE UF010 CHANGE.

         THE FOLLOWING MODS WERE RELOCATED:

              FCI01 (CODE FOR MVS/SP JES2 WAS ALSO ADDED)
              RNB03
              RNB05
              RNB08

              NOTES:
               (1) SOME CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE ABOVE RELOCATED
                   CODE.  HOWEVER, THE OLD PARSE TEXT WAS USED TO
                   AID IN THE IDENTIFICATION OF ALL CODE PERTAINNING
                   TO A GIVEN FUNCTION.
               (2) AS OF JUNE 1983, THE ABOVE RELOCATED CODE HAS
                   NOT BEEN TESTED BY FCI OR RNB.

         THE FOLLOWING MODS WERE SUPERCEEDED:

              RNB02
              UF033

ONL03 -- ENSURED THAT JCT'S AND IOT'S READ FROM THE SPOOL BELONG TO
         THE JOB FOR WHICH THEY WERE READ.

ONL04 -- CHANGED THE LISTDS CSECT TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN EMPTY AND
         NONEXISTENT DSID'S.  ALSO, SINCE THE DSID FIELD IS OFTEN
         CLEARED BY AUTHORIZATION CHECKING CODE, A SEPERATE FIELD IN
         THE QCOMMON CSECT IS USED TO KEEP TRACK OF THE LAST DSID FOR
         THE "L * +/-" COMMAND.  THE FINDJOB, LIST, AND LISTDS CSECT'S
         USE THE NEW FIELD.

ONL05 -- CHANGED THE JLOG COMMAND TO BETTER DETERMINE IF THERE IS
         A VALID JOB LOG.  THIS SUPERCEEDS THE RNB04 CHANGE.

ONL06 -- USES THE &QONL GOBAL SET SYMBOL TO ALLOW THE GENERATION
         OF ONL'S OWN BRAND OF CONTROL IN THE AUTH CSECT.

ONL07 -- ADDED THE THE FOLLOWING COMMAND ABBREVIATIONS:

            DELE FOR DEL
            CANC FOR CAN

ONL08 -- USES THE &QONL GOBAL SET SYMBOL TO SKIP TESTING A V-TYPE
         ADDRESS CONSTANT BEFORE LOADING QUEUECMN TO PREVENT GETING
         CONDITION CODES ON THE LINK-EDIT.

ONL09 -- ADDED THE &QDSPRFX GOBAL SET SYMBOL TO DEFINE THE FIRST LEVEL
         QUALIFIERS FOR THE HASPCKPT AND HASPACE DATA SET NAMES.  THE
         DEFAULT IS 'SYS1'.  A VALUE OF 'JES2' IS USED IF &QONL IS SET
         TO ONE.

ONL10 -- CHANGED THE "DC" COMMAND TO SUPPORT AN OPERAND OF "J" (JOB)
         IN ADDITION TO "B", "S", AND "T" (BATCH, STC, AND TSU).

ONL11 -- ADDED SP V1.3.3 SUPPORT FOR THE DD COMMAND.

ONL12 -- USES THE &QONL GOBAL SET SYMBOL IN CSECT REPOS TO DO AN
         'OLD TIME' FIND IF THE STRING BEGINS WITH A SLASH ("/").

ONL13 -- QUOTED STRING SPECIFICATIONS FOR THE FIND COMMAND MAY BE
         DELIMITED WITH DOUBLE QUOTES AS WELL AS SINGLE QUOTES.
         THE FIND COMMAND HELP INFORMATION HAS ALSO BEEN UPDATED.

ONL14 -- DEFINED THE QFLG1SDS BIT TO INDICATE WHEN THE CURRENT JOB
         IS A SYSTEM DATA SET JOB AND DOES NOT HAVE A JCT.  THE
         FLAG IS DEFINED IN QCOMMON, SET IN FINDJOB, AND IS TESTED
         BY VARIOUS MODULES.

ONL15 -- ADDED ACF2 SP 1.3.3 SUPPORT TO THE JHIST COMMAND.
