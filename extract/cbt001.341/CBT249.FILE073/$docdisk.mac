 INTRODUCTION



 XXDISKMP  is a disk activity analysis program, taking as input GTF inpu
 records  and  producing  a  report  of  disk  usage over the entire mea
 period, one report for each disk.

 Written  in  PL/I,  it provides support for 3330 model 1, 3330 model 2
 disks with or without the fixed head over cylinders 1 and 2.

 The  program  is  driven by a device table which contains information a
 the  disk  devices configured into the system, and includes support for
 with  alternate  paths  to them. The program, as distributed contains p
 for  two  separate  device tables, selection between them being under E
 control. It is also possible to alter the device table for a specific r
 EXEC  parm  information.  This  could be used, for example, to separate
 activity  on  a  disk,  treating  the main path address, and the altern
 address as essentially different devices.

 Output  from the program is in the form of a page of statistics for all
 for  the  measurement  period as a whole, plus a two-page report for ea
 The  first  page  of  the disk report has general information about the
 plus  a  seek  analysis  table  of all cylinders divided into slots of
 cylinders  each,  depending on the number of cylinders that the device
 second  page  of  the report contains another seek analysis table, this
 the  50  busiest  cylinders  by  single  cylinders.  There are three me
 choosing the busiest cylinders selectable by EXEC card parameters, as d
 in  the  section on running XXDISKMP. The second page also gives an ide
 performance  of  the  sparse  matrix  scheme  used  in  the seek analys
 creation as to how near overflow it is.

 This  program  will  cope  with up to 20 devices in a single run, input
 21st  device  being  counted  but ignored. It allocates storage dynamic
 each  device,  its storage use being dependent on the number of devices
 the input.

                                 INSTALLATION

 The device information in XXDISKMP is contained in tables in the two pr
 XXGOODM  and  XXKEGWM.  There are two separate tables which enables the
 to  support  two  different I/O configurations, controlled by an exec p
 program  was  written this way to support the bank's two separate insta
 which had the different configurations.

 Device tables were used for the following reasons:

 1.   It provided a means of supporting alternate paths for devices.

 2.    It was the only  means of determining which of the 3350 devices h
 heads on cylinders 1 and 2.

 The  device tables are arrays (0:4095) fixed binary(15).  The bounds co
 with  the possible device address range (X'000' to X'FFF'). the meaning
 entries are as follows -

 NEGATIVE  - This address is the alternate path to a device. The main pa
 the address (absolute value of entry).

 ZERO - There is no device at this address, or the device at this addres
 a direct access device. Either way, ignore any input records for this a

 POSITIVE - The device type is as follows:

     1 - 3330 Model I
     2 - 3330 Model II
     3 - 3350
     4 - 3350 with fixed heads over cylinders 1 and 2.

 Positive  values  larger  than  4  are treated as invalid device types
 program and are ignored.

 Two small programs were written to aid in the production of the device
 and are included in the source library.  A suggested method of using th
 follows:

 1.   Compile and run the program XXHEXPT in the source library.  It is
 procedure  program  needing  no external subroutines.  The program has
 printer  output  file  with  the  DDNAME  of  PRINT, and produces a lis

  Sample JCL for running XXHEXPT is:

  //GOSTEP EXEC PGM=XXHEXPT,REGION=50K,PARM='/A'
  //PRINT DD SYSOUT=A,DCB=(LRECL=137,BLKSIZE=1374,RECFM=VBA)

 In  this  case the output would include channels up to and including ch
 Note  that  the '/' is required before the parm as parm information bef
 is used to provide execution time options to the PLI run time routines.

 2.  Take an IOGEN listing for your installation and write against the a
 of  the  disk devices their types.  For devices with alternate paths, w
 negative of the main path addresses against the alternate path address.

 3.   Print  off  from the source library the members XXGOODM, XXKEGWM,
 XXDEVPT  and  XXPARSM.  Using the list of devices prepared, code a devi
 similar to the one in XXGOODM and replace the one in XXGOODM with it.

 4.  Compile  the  routines XXDEVPT XXCONVH and your version of XXGOODM
 them  together  to form a single load module. Give it the name of XXDEV
 is the main procedure name. Run this program. It requires a region size
 and  has  a  single  printer output file with a DDNAME of PRINT. Sample
 running the program is:

  //GOSTEP EXEC PGM=XXDEVPT,REGION=?????????
  //PRINT DD SYSOUT=A,DCB=(LRECL=137,BLKSIZE=1374,RECFM=VBA)

 The output from this program is a list, similar to that of XXHEXPT, exc
 device types have been 'filled in'. Asterisks appear where:
 1.  The device type is illegal (The entry >5).
 2.  The alternate path specified is illegal (The entry <-4095).
 3.   When  the  entry  is  for an alternate path, the entry at the main
 illegal  (The entry is either negative which implies another alternate

 5.   If  you  have  two  configurations  repeat  the  process  to  prod
 subroutines, naming the second one XXKEGWM.


 6.  If you only have one configuration, attach another label - XXGOODM
 procedure XXKEGWM so that it has two entry names, both being for the sa
 point.

 7.   The  heading  routine,  XXNWPGE, which prints a heading at the top
 page will print either GOODMANS or KEGWORTH in the heading. This can be
 by  editing  the declarations for the heading lines within XXNWPGE to s
 relevant to your heading.

 8.   The  EXEC  parm options contain a keyword option to give informati
 which  centre  the  program  is run, which in Nat West decides the devi
 used.  The  two keywords are GOODMANS and KEGWORTH; the parameter parse
 accepts  any truncated version of them. To change these parameters to s
 meaningful  to  your  installation  edit  the  keywords  list  in  the
 procedure  VALID  in the parameter parse procedure XXPARSM. This proced
 contains  the  defaults for the maximum number of devices that the prog
 allocate  space  for (at present 2), the default centre (1 - meaning GO
 and  the  method  of  choosing the busiest cylinders for the selective
 print  (1  -  meaning  row  sums).  These  could  be changed if desired
 suitable values for your installation.

 9.   The  seek analysis table uses a sparse matrix scheme, which can co
 most  at  the  moment  10,000  entries. This is a guesstimate and the t
 never  overflowed so far in use at Nat West. Should the table size be t
 or  too  large  for your use, it can easily be changed up to a maximum
 elements  (the  maximum  upper  bound of a PLI array). The following ar
 need changing:

 A) the declaration of TO_LIST in XXMAINL to the value.
 B) the declaration of TO_LIST in XXPRTDV to the value.
 C) the allocation statement for BIG_AREA in XXMAINL to reflect
 the changed size of the structure DEVICE_DATA.
 D)  the  ISASIZE parameter in the PLIXOPT declaration in XXDEVMN to ref

 RUNNING XXDISKMP



 Sample JCL for running XXDISKMP is:

  //X2345678 JOB accountinginfo,MSGLEVEL=1,MSGCLASS=A,REGION=450K,
  // TIME=2
  //DSTEP EXEC PGM=XXDISKMP,PARM='ISASIZE(210K),NR/3,GOOD,MAX'
  //INFILE DD DSN=name.of.gtf.input.file,DISP=SHR

  //PRINT DD SYSOUT=A,DCB=(LRECL=137,BLKSIZE=1374,RECFM=VBA)

 NOTES:

 1.   The  importance of the ISASIZE parameter to the execution performa
 PLI  program  is crucial. The value specified for this program should b
 65K for each device to be used over the default of 2. Getting the ISASI
 can  result in an 80A abend, or a much larger region being used than ne
 Use  the  REPORT  option  of  the run time routines the first few times
 XXDISKMP to get an idea of how much is required.

 2.  The region size specified should be 200K more than the ISASIZE to a
 program, loaded routines and buffers.

 3.  Program parms: There are four parameters available to control the e
 of the program. Any combination of them may be specified, or none in wh
 the  default  values  will  be  used. Separate each parameter with a co
 space. The parameters available are:

 a)  Maximum  number  of  devices  to  be  allocated. This should be an
 integer  between 1 and 20. If a value larger than 20 is specified, then
 be used.

 b)  Method of deciding which cylinders will be selected for the print o
 busiest cylinders:

   i)  ROWS  -  The  rows of the array are summed, and the 50 cylinders
   largest  row  sums  are  used.  The  rows of the array correspond to
   cylinder  numbers,  the  columns correspond to the TO cylinder number
   what  comes  into  a  column  must  leave by the same row number (TO
   number becomes the next FROM cylinder), the row sums and the column s

 Disk activity analysis program


   differ  in  each case by only 1 in two cylinders, to the largest row
   used for the 50 largest column sums also.

   ii)  MAXIMUM  -  The  largest elements in each of the rows and column
   matrix  are found, and the 50 largest in each is used. This can mean
   column numbers in the printout can differ from the row numbers.

   iii)  NODIAG  -  This is the same as the largest elements in each of
   and  columns  except  that  elements  on  the  diagonal  are  ignored
   comparison.  (This  means  in effect that seeks from a cylinder to it
   not used).


 3.  Device  configuration table to be used. In the distributed version,
 options available are GOODMANS and KEGWORTH.

 Note: any of the keyword parameters may be truncated as much as desired
 one character.


 4. Device table alteration parameters. There may be as many of these as
 subject  to the system restriction that the EXEC parm field cannot be m
 100  characters  long. Each parm is of the following form (tttt,sss,eee
 The brackets must be present. The meaning of each of the subparameters

 tttt  -  device  type.  Must  be  one  of  3330,  3330-II,  3350,  3350
 abbreviations  are  allowed.  If the device type is not one of these, t
 parameter up to the next right hand bracket will be ignored.

 sss - starting address for the table replacement. Must be a 3 digit hex
 without any X or quotes.

 eee  -  ending  address  for  table  replacement. Must be a 3 digit hex
 without any X or quotes.

 aaa  -  optional.  If  present  the  comma  preceeding it should be pre
 absent,  then leave the comma out also. This subparameter should be of
 ddX,  where  dd  are hex digits. This is the alternate path address, sh
 exist.  To get the address of the first device on the alternate path, t
 two  hex  digits  of  the alternate path parameter are merged with the
 digit of the main path address. This is the alternate path address of t
 device  in  the  range.  Alternate  paths are incremented by 1 as the m

 addresses are incremented by 1.

 Examples of valid device table alteration parms:

 (3350,700,707,80X)  -  Eight  3350  disk  drives in the address range X
 X'707' with alternate path addresses in the range X'800' to X'807'.

 (3330,1F0,1FF)  -  A bank of 16 3330 disk drives in the address range X
 X'1FF'. No alternate path address exists.



 Files:

 INFILE - input file of GTF records for the devices under measurement.

 PRINT  -  printer  output  file  for results. DCB information is option
 program will open the file with a linesize of 132.

 Timings  -  the  time  taken  by  the program depends directly on the a
 input. GTF is a very prolific program - the sample output covered three
 for about two and a half hours, producing over 100,000 output records t
 cylinders  of 3350 disk space. The analysis of this output took 45 seco
 model  3033 running multiprogramming batch mode. A reasonable guesstima
 be 14 seconds per 10 (3350) cylinders of input.

 INPUT

 The  input  to  the  program  consists  of GTF start IO, and IO interru
 records  for  the  disk  devices  under measurement. GTF should be star
 MODE=EXT, TIME=YES (external mode, timestamps required) in the EXEC par
 with  a  request  to  trace  IO and SIO records. (Specify IOP and SIOP
 trace for selected devices - reply to the prompts issued).

 Other types of GTF records pertaining to IO are counted but are then ig
 the program.

 Full  details  on  how  to  use  GTF  are  in the IBM manual 'OS/VS2 MV
 Programming Library: Service Aids'. The formats of the various records
 given in the IBM manual 'OS/VS2 MVS Service Aids Logic'.

 OUTPUT

 A sample output is included as dataset number 6 on this tape.

 The  output  from the program consists of a single page of summary data
 two  page  report  for  each device for which data has been collected u
 maximum  number  of  devices specified in the EXEC parm or the default
 addition, should there be a lost events record in the input, the data c
 so  far  is  printed,  provided there have been a significant number of
 read  -  (this  number is defined as a constant in the procedure XXMAIN
 set at the moment to 100) - and then the device data collected is clear

 Each page has a heading giving details of the date and time of the star
 measuring  period, the date and time of the analysis, the centre where
 was  collected  (implying which of the possible device tables was used)
 version number of the program (currently 2.0.0).

 The overall report gives the following information:

 1)  Reason  for  the end of processing - usually end of file reached on
 data  input file, but it could also be that a SYNAD error occurred, rai
 PL/1  transmit  condition preventing the reading of more data. The othe
 for  the  program to stop processing data is that the timestamps on the
 are more than 2 days apart. This is because the program converts all ti
 into  relative  times  to  the  first  time  recorded and holds them as
 milliseconds  in binary fullwords. Should overflow occur when trying to
 a  timestamp  to  this  format,  then the program is terminated. This c

 usually  arises  when a GTF dataset is reused, since GTF does not reset

 3  Count  of  all  the  records read and list of counts of the various
 records  read.  The  Start  IO  records are subdivided into the conditi
 returned  by the instruction. In addition to those types of records use
 program  (Start  IO  and  IO  interrupt records) the following record t
 counted but not used further:
 PCI - Program controlled interruption record
 LOST  DATA  -  Any  sort  of lost events record - causes data accumulat
 printed then discarded.
 SENSE - A sense Start IO is one to record 0 on track 0 of cylinder 0.
 EOS - End of Sense interrupt record.
 BAD - Unidentifiable record.
 TIMESTAMP - Timestamp record - there is one at the start of each block.
 BYPASSED  -  This  is  a  separate  count  of  all valid record types t
 bypassed  for  one  of two reasons - a - the device type for the addres
 record  was defined in the device table as not a direct access device -
 maximum  number  of  devices specified in the EXEC parm or default were
 allocated and this record was for a different device address.

 4  List  of  character  ranges  for  the seek analysis table and list o
 Channel Status Words stored when a Start IO returns condition code 1.



 The format of the report on each device is as follows:

 Each  page  has a heading giving the device address, the alternate path
 if  found,  the  device  type  and  the number of cylinders. This is th
 device capacity plus 20 for alternate tracks etc.

 The  first  page also has general information about the device: number
 IO records received for this device, divided into the condition codes r
 For  start  IO  condition code 1 - (device busy) the hex value of bits
 the  Channel  Status  Word is given together with a list of the number

 XXDISKMP                                                              P
 Disk activity analysis program


 that  channel status word occurred. A list of common CSWs is given on t
 page of the report, full details of what each bit means are given in Pr
 of Operation.

 The number of records received for this device is divided into the numb
 were  addressed  through  the  main  path  and the number addressed thr
 alternate path.

 The  number  of cylinders seeked is the total number of cylinders seeke
 by  the moving head. It does not take into account any seeks to cylinde
 2  of  a  3350  fixed  head  device  and compensates for the order of c
 (2,1,0)  on  that  device.  The  average  seek is the total number of c
 seeked  divided  by the number of seeks to non fixed heads and the maxi
 is the largest single seek.

 The  average  IO  and  maximum IO times are calculated as the differenc
 timestamps  on  the  start  IO  condition code 0 record starting the IO
 corresponding  IO  interrupt  or  next  start  IO condition code 0 for
 device.

 The  average and maximum defer times are the times between a Start IO c
 code  1 indicating a device busy and a successful Start IO for the same
 If there are seeks to cylinders which do not exist, then the number of
 printed.

 For 3350 Fixed head devices the number of seeks to cylinders 1 and 2 is
 as the number of dummy seeks.

 The  busiest  cylinder  is  defined  as the cylinder which has the most
 activity  in  terms  of  seeks  to it, and the highest self hit cylinde
 cylinder with the largest number of seeks to itself.

 The other part of the first page of the report is a table of seeks by s
 the  entire  device.  The  grid  presents  the  number of seeks from on
 cylinders  in  each  slot  to  a  cylinder in another slot. The numbers
 across  the  top  and  down  the  side  are the numbers of the cylinder
 beginning of each slot.

 The  second page of the report is a table of seeks between individual c
 -  the  50 busiest cylinders being chosen according to the method liste
 top  right  hand  corner  of  the  page. This method is selectable by E
 parameters and is described in the section on running XXDISKMP.
