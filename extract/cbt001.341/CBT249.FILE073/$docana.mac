 GENERAL INFORMATION


 Analyse  is a PL/I post processing program for SMF type 73 records, whi
 a continuous graph of channel activity over the measurement period.

 The output is in the form of a line printer graph of the average utilis
 each  channel  over  the  sampling  period  of  each  record, calculate
 percentage  of  samples taken where the channel was busy, and the perce
 samples where the channel was busy and the CPU was in a wait state.

 Optionally  the  output can also include a plot for each channel of the
 utilisation  recorded against the start io rate, and a histogram of uti
 against time for each channel.


 Analyse was written to measure channel activity at the bank's Kegworth
 Centre,  to  find out what effect the installation of 3800 laser printe
 have  on  channel capacity. It is now in occasional use as part of the
 monitoring process.

 INPUT


 The  input  to  ANALYSE  is  SMF  records type 73 (channel activity). T
 produced  by RMF or MF/1 and are collected by SMF and written to one of
 datasets (SYS1.MANX or SYS1.MANY). ANALYSE will read these datasets and
 the type 73 records for its use.

 Information  about  production and collection of the input data can be
 IBM's SMF, RMF and MF/1 reference manuals.

 INSTALLATION OF ANALYSE



 The  ANALYSE program uses two members of the source library PDS, datase
 2  on this tape. The two members are ANALYSE and XXEXPCM. (XXEXPCM is a
 by  XXDISKMP, the other program on this tape). The main procedure is th
 ANALYSE.

 Installation  of  ANALYSE merely consists of compiling the two members
 restored  PDS  and linking them together into a load module. Each membe
 PDS  contains  one  external  procedure  which  is preceeded by a *PROC
 turning all the listing options on and specifying OPT(2).

 RUNNING ANALYSE



 ANALYSE will run in a REGION size of 250Kb. It has one input file with
 of INFILE, and one output file for the results with a DDNAME of PRINT.
 is a DD card for PLIDUMP and an error occurs, then a dump is taken.



 The  EXEC  parm  information  that  optionally can be specified to ANAL
 combination of any of the characters

                     0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 A B C D E F   P H

 The  characters 0-9,A-F are channel specifications and alter the normal
 the  printout  so  that  the  two  graphs  printed  per  page have the
 separated  between them. The characters P and H are flags to turn the h
 printing  and  busyness  against  start-io rate plotting. Full details
 options are given in the section 'Format of the Output' below.

 Sample JCL for running ANALYSE is as follows:

  //x2345678 JOB accounting-info,MSGLEVEL=1,MSGCLASS=A,REGION=250K
  //ANSTEP EXEC PGM=ANALYSE,PARM='/say678PH'
  //INFILE DD DSN=SYS1.MANX,DISP=SHR
  //PRINT DD SYSOUT=A,DCB=(LRECL=137,RECFM=VBA,BLKSIZE=1374)
 (//PLIDUMP DD SYSOUT=A)

 The line length of PRINT is specified in the program as being 132.

 OUTPUT FORMAT



 A sample output from ANALYSE is included as file 5 of this tape.

 The  output  from  ANALYSE  consists of two graphs plotted immediately
 input records, side by side running down the page until there is no mor
 The  graph on the left gives the channel utilisation calculated as a pe
 of  the  samples  where  the channel in question was busy, and the grap
 right  gives  the  percentage of samples where the channel was busy and
 was  in  the  wait  state,  plotted  separately  for  each block multip
 selector  channel.  No  information  about  the utilisation of byte mul
 channels  is  provided  in  the  input  records.  The  time  of the end
 measurement interval is printed at the left hand side of each line.

 If  any  channel  ids are specifiead in the EXEC parm, then the right h
 graph  is  changed  to  be the percentage utilisation of the specified
 which are printed in the right hand graph, the remaining channels being
 in  the left hand graph. This was included so that the utilisation of a
 path channels could be easily seen.

 At  the bottom of each page is a summary for each channel of the averag
 of  start  ios  per second and for block multiplexors and selector chan
 average utilisation, for the period covered by the records on the page.

 If  the  letter 'P' is included in the EXEC parm list, then summary inf
 is  collected for each block multiplexor channel. At the end of file, a
 made,  consisting  of  a grid with channel utilisation along the left h
 and  start  io  rage across the bottom. An entry is made for each recor
 element  of  the  grid  corresponding  to  the  start  io  rate and the
 utilisation  for  that  channel.  The  sum of each entry is printed as
 character code as follows.

 1 .... 9     represent the numbers 1 ... 9.
   A         represents the range  10 - 19.
   B         represents the range  20 - 39.
   C         represents the range  40 - 79.
   D         represents the range  80 - 159.
   E         represents the range  160 - 320 etc.

 One of these plots is printed for each block multiplexor channel.

 If  the  character  'H'  is  specified  as  part  of the EXEC parm list
