                  INTRODUCTION TO QUANDARY

                        Version 5.0

I.  Access keys and the READ statement.

1.  The basic READ statement.

     The READ statement is used to specify the references to
be read by QUANDARY.  The simplest form of the READ statement
specifies a single, complete access key:

     READ *SENTENCE STRUCTURE/

The word READ must be followed by exactly one blank.  This
statement will read only references with *SENTENCE STRUCTURE
as an access key.

2.  Access keys.

     ERIC references are designed to be retrieved using ERIC
descriptors and identifiers.  Abstractors assign descriptors
to each reference from a standardized list of keywords.
Descriptors of primary relevance to the reference are prefixed
with an asterisk and referred to as "major descriptors."
Descriptors of secondary relevance are left unprefixed and are
referred to as "minor descriptors."  ERIC identifiers are similar
to descriptors but are created by the abstractor in the absence
of a suitable descriptor.  References are typically assigned
several descriptors and, possibly, one or two identifiers.
     QUANDARY access keys are generalizations of ERIC descriptors.
There are two types of access keys:

          1)  Unstarred access keys are not prefixed with an
     asterisk.  A READ statement specifying an unstarred access
     key will cause the records containing that access key as a
     major or minor ERIC descriptor , a major or minor identifier,
     or an author to be read.
          2)  Starred access keys are prefixed with an asterisk.
     A READ statement specifying a starred access key will cause
     only those records containing the access key as a major
     ERIC descriptor or identifier to be read.

A listing of access keys may be found in a QUANDARY access key
dictionary.

3.  Truncating access keys.

     Although a complete access key was used in the READ statement
above, access keys can be truncated to as few as four characters.
A QUANDARY dictionary lists the access keys

     SENSORY TRAINING

     SENTENCE DIAGRAMMING

     SENTENCE STRUCTURE

     SENTENCES

     SEQUENTIAL APPROACH

All of the following are equivalent:

     READ SENTENCE STRUCTURE/

     READ SENTENCE STRUCT/

     READ SENTENCE S/

Suppose we write

     READ SENT/

SENT is a truncation for SENTENCE DIAGRAMMING, SENTENCE STRUCTURE,
and SENTENCES.  The preceding statement will read references for
all of these access keys.  Ambiguous truncations can thus be used
to specify whole classes of related access keys.
     Care should be taken to insert blanks as needed.  The following
statement must be used to read only SENTENCE DIAGRAMMING and
SENTENCE STRUCTURE references:

     READ SENTENCE /

4.  OR:  Broadening the search request.

     Suppose we want to examine references on LINGUISTICS and on
SENTENCE DIAGRAMMING.  We can write

     READ LINGUISTICS×SENTENCE D/

The OR symbol ("×") specifies that any reference with LINGUISTICS,
SENTENCE D, or both as access keys will be read.  The OR symbol
broadens the search to cover an entire class of (usually related)
descriptors:

     READ LINGUISTICS×SENTENCE D×*GRAMMAR/

5.  AND:  Narrowing the search request.

     Access keys frequently encompass subject areas which are wider
than our actual area of interest.  If we were interested in all
references dealing with the grammatical aspects of linguistics, we
would not want to print all the LINGUISTICS references and pore
through them to select those which are also GRAMMAR references.  We
can write:

     READ GRAMMAR&LINGUISTICS/

The AND symbol ("&") specifies that every reference with both the
access key GRAMMAR and the access key LINGUISTICS will be read.
In casual conversational use, "and" and "or" are often used
interchangeably, but in QUANDARY statements, AND is always used
strictly in the sense of "both . . . and."
     The AND symbol narrows the scope of the search to cover
only references common to several access keys.  Occasionally
the search may be narrowed to the point where no reference
contains every access key specified.  This is less likely if
only one or two ANDS are used together.

II.  Continuing QUANDARY statements.

    Long statements with many ANDs and ORs may not fit on a single
line.  If this happens, interrrupt the statement after a convenient
AND or OR and resume it at the beginning of the next line.  Continue
in this manner until the statement is completed.  An example is

    READ *ROMANCE LANGUAGES×FRENCH  ×ITALIAN  ×
ROMANIAN/

The blanks at the end of the first line will be eliminated and the
statement will be interpreted as if on one long line:

     READ *ROMANCE LANGUAGES×FRENCH  ×ITALIAN  ×ROMANIAN/

Notice that FRENCH has been written with two trailing blanks so
that it will not be interpreted as a truncation for FRENCH and
FRENCH LITERATURE.

III.  Running QUANDARY from TSO.

     QUANDARY is normally run from TSO terminals.  A terminal
session might begin

     logon xy123cd

     The LOGON command is used to initiate the terminal session.
Instead of "xy123cd" a userid assigned by an instructor or department
head should be used.  Upper and lower case letters may be used
interchangeably during a QUANDARY terminal session.  The terminal
will respond to the LOGON command with

     READY

     The next line to type is

     qndinit

     The terminal will respond with several initialization messages
followed by

     READY

     Then type

     qndrun

     The terminal will respond with a colon to request a QUANDARY
statement.

     :
     read *linguistics/go/

The GO statement causes the first ten references which satisfy the
READ statement to be printed.  The listing can be stopped at any
time by hitting the attention key (marked ATTN or PA1).  Following
the references the terminal will print

     181 RECORDS SATISFIED THE READ STATEMENT
      10 RECORDS WERE PRINTED
     :

(These statistics can be printed without the accompanying references
by typing TALLY/ instead of GO/.)
     The colon requests another QUANDARY statement.  We can
enter another search request or type

     end/
     logoff

The END statement terminates the QUANDARY run.  The LOGOFF
command, which is not a QUANDARY statement and does not end
with a diagonal, terminates the TSO session.
    It's a good idea at this point to go to a terminal and
try a few simple searches before reading further.

IV.  More complex search requests.

     When combinations of ANDs and ORs are used in an expression,
the ORs will be applied first to broaden the search.  The resulting
classes will then be narrowed by the ANDs so that only references
with an access key in each of the resulting broader classes will
be read:

     READ *LINGUISTICS×*GRAMMAR&
COLLEGE CURRICULUM×COLLEGE INSTRUCTION&GRADUATE STUDY/

Each reference read will pertain to either *LINGUISTICS or
*GRAMMAR, and also to COLLEGE CURRICULUM or COLLEGE INSTRUCTION,
and to GRADUATE STUDY.  This statement might be used to research
curricula and instruction for graduate level programs in grammar
and linguistics.

V.  Running QUANDARY in the background.

     QUANDARY can also be run in the background, that is, without
a TSO terminal.  There is no limit to the number of references
which can be printed in the background.  The easiest way to run
in the background is to use the SUBMIT statement:

     READ *GRAMMAR/SUBMIT/

The SUBMIT statement builds a job to run the current search request
and print all references on the printer.  The printout normally
will be filed in bin 9O at the Computer Center.  The terminal
will respond with the jobname which will be used to identify the
printout:

     JOB XY123CDQ WILL BE SUBMITTED

VI.  The OPTIONS statement.

     Options can be specified to QUANDARY by means of an OPTIONS
statement:

     options pagesize(50),space(2)/

This statement requests fifty lines per page, double-spaced.
Options must be immediately followed by their values in
parentheses and must be separated by blanks or commas. OPTIONS
statements can be placed anywhere in a QUANDARY program.  If an
option is repeated, the last value specified will be used.
     The printing and formatting options, and their initial
values are

     LINESIZE(60)         Sixty characters per line.
     SPACE(1)             Single-spaced.
     PAGESIZE(59)         Fifty-nine lines per page.
     SKIP(3)              Triple-space between references.  If
                          SKIP is greater than PAGESIZE, one
                          reference will be printed per page.
     COLUMN(6)            Left margin in column six.
     SEARCH(1)            The number to be assigned to the next
                          search.  This normally begins at 1 and
                          is automatically incremented by 1 after
                          each search.
     PRINTLIM(10)         Up to ten references will be printed
                          on TSO.  The maximum value permitted
                          for TSO is PRINTLIM(40).

     Several options apply to programs submitted through TSO.
These are effective only when specified before the first SUBMIT
statement.

     DEST(LOCAL)          Submitted programs will print at the
                          Computer Center.  Other locations can
                          be specified as DEST(RMTn), for example,
                          DEST(RMT2) for Haley Center.
     BIN(9O)              Printouts will be filed in bin 9O.
     TIME(0100)           The submitted job will be allowed to
                          execute up to 1 minute.  The format
                          is TIME(mmss) in minutes and seconds:
                          TIME(0029) or TIME(29) both mean 29
                          seconds.
     LINES(30000)         The submitted job will be allowed to
      or LINES(30K)       print up to 30000 lines.
     FORMS(8101)          The submitted job will be printed on
                          8101 paper (standard green forms).
     JOBNAME(XXXXXXXX)    The jobname to be assigned to the
                          submitted job.


VII.  Miscellaneous statements.

     This section should probably be skimmed or skipped on the
first reading.

1.  The LISTDICT statement.

     The LISTDICT statement is used to list parts of the access
key dictionary:

     listdict fren/

This statement would list all access keys beginning FREN and give
the number of references for each.  The format of the access keys
is the same as for a READ statement.

2.  The PRINT statement.

     The PRINT statement is used to restrict printing to
specified fields of references:

     print author,title/

This statement would limit printing to the AUTHOR and TITLE
fields (along with the ACCNUM, CHNUM, and DATE fields, which
are always printed).  The TITLE, AUTHOR, DESCRIPTOR, IDENTIFIER,
NOTE, ISSUE, ABSTRACT, AVAILABILITY, JOURNAL, INSTITUTION, and
SPONSOR fields can be specified, separated by blanks or commas.
(The ACCNUM, CHNUM, and DATE fields can also be specified, but
are always printed anyway.)  The fields which are printed when
a search is run are determined by the last PRINT statement entered.
To resume printing all fields, specify

     print all/
