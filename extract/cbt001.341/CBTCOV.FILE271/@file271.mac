//***FILE 271 is the QUANDARY system from Don Hudson of Auburn      *
//*           University in Auburn, Alabama.  This system is        *
//*           used for examining some Department of Education       *
//*           databases that are still available, but for more      *
//*           modern computing systems, these Dept of Education     *
//*           files are also available in different formats.        *
//*                                                                 *
//*           The Dept of Education databases are called CIJE       *
//*           and RIE.  File 277 contains samples of them.          *
//*                                                                 *
//*           The entire package is contained on Files 271          *
//*           through 277 of the CBT Overflow Tape.                 *

//*           This file is the documentation for the                *

//*           The author says that the system still should work,    *
//*           although Auburn University stopped using it several   *
//*           years ago.  In any case, it is available as a nice    *
//*           coding example, and I hope that somebody can profit   *
//*           from it.                                              *
