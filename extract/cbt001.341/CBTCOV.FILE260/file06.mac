0                    HOW TO CONTRIBUTE TO
                       THE PL/I PROJECT
                 CONTRIBUTED PROGRAM LIBRARY
-     The Contributed Program Library of  the PL/I Project of
 SHARE,  Inc  is a  collection of  useful programs,   macros,
 modules and techniques for use  by the PL/I programmer.   It
 is maintained  currently at  the University  of Georgia  and
 distributed  through the  SHARE  Program  Library Agency  at
 Triangle University Computation Center.   The program number
 of this program,   to be used when ordering it  from SPLA is
 360D-03.2.019.
      Contributions  are solicited  from all  members of  the
 PL/I using community.  These contributions will be converted
 to the format  of the Library tape,  which has  no object or
 load modules, and consists of sequential files.
      Contributions can be of  any form,  programs,  systems,
 macros,   techniques described  in  papers  or fragments  of
 programs, or combinations of any of the previously mentioned
 items.   The only  requirement is that the  submission be of
 some use to other members of the PL/I user community.
      Since the  contributions are  converted to  the Library
 format by the librarian,  there are some restrictions on the
 form of a contribution.   In general,  these are very minor.
 All contributions must  be either on cards or  on tape 9-trk
 800BPI,   9-trk  1600BPI  or 9-trk  6250  BPI.    The  paper
 documentation for any given contribution  should be not more
 than 2  or 3 pages,  since  it will be converted  to machine
 readable   form   by   the   librarian.     Other   required
 documentation should be in machine readable form,  either as
 input to  a text  processor or  as directly  printable files
 (both is the best way).   Contributions should be limited in
 size  to  much   less  than  one  reel   of  tape.    Larger
 contributions should be submitted directly to SPLA.  IEBCOPY
 or IEHPROGM unloaded tapes are  allowed,  but IEHDASDR files
 cannot be  restored at the librarians  location.   Inovation
 Data Processing FDR tapes can  be restored and can therefore
 be submitted.   All load libraries and object libraries will
 be dropped from any submission.
