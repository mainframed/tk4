 HOW TO DO IT .....

   Make a pds on your MVS system.  Be sure to include documentation
   members.

   Put the pds into TSO XMIT format using the DSN( ) and OUTDSN( )
   keyworks of XMIT, as follows:

   XMIT node.id DSN(your.pds) OUTDSN(your.pds.xmi)

   The XMIT-format dataset is FB-80, and can be downloaded to a pc
   in binary (that is, no ASCII or CRLF).

   From the pc, attach the file to an email to me.  If it's very
   big, you can pkzip it first.  My email addresses are:

       sbgolob@ibm.net   and   sbgolob@aol.com

   and I'd suggest that you copy both of them, when you send the
   email with your attached file.

   That's all there is to it, folks!  Thanks in advance.  Your
   stuff will be appreciated by the public.


Sincerely,    Sam Golob
