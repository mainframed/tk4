        SHARE PL/I Project Contributed Program Library

0     This is  the Contributed  Program Library  of the  PL/I
 Project of SHARE,  Inc.  It represents contributions by PL/I
 users to the general community. There are many types of con-
 tributions possible,   from documentation  of techniques  to
 whole systems of programs.  As new contributions are made to
 this library,  new versions will be placed in the SHARE Pro-
 gram Library, from where it can be ordered.
      In order to make the  contributed programs available to
 as many different  systems as possible,  all of  the data on
 this  tape  is  in  a  simple  sequential  format,   not  an
 "unloaded" format.   For the same reason,  the tape is unla-
 beled,  and the documented file numbers refer to actual phy-
 sical files (i.e. tape marks).  The programs to unload an OS
 PDS to this format, as well as recreate one from this format
 are present on the tape.  However, due to the simple format,
 it should be straightforward for anyone with a system having
 a tape drive to use the data and programs on this tape.
      There are no load modules on  the tape due to inconsis-
 tencies between  different systems.  All  of the data  is in
 some printable form,  although some of it is upper and lower
 case. Upper and lower case files will be designated.
      The first  10 files on this  tape are reserved  for the
 use of the librarian.  The remaining  files are used to con-
 tain the  contributions in  the different  formats possible.
 The most common contribution format is an OS PDS, which will
 be converted to  a sequential file with a line  of text con-
 taining
0                      ./ ADD NAME=membernm
0before each member.   The other possible format  is a simple
 sequential  file  containing either  documentation  of  some
 sort, or a program or program segment.
      The major contributions  on this tape will  all have as
 part of the distribution a  documentation file of some sort.
 There might be a sequential documentation file, such as this
 one, or a PDS of documentation files to be printed, or a PDS
 of documentation  to be  formatted using  a text  formatting
 processor.
      The relative positions of  the various contributions on
 this tape  will remain constant  through various  updates of
 both this tape  and the individual contributions.   The only
 exception to this rule will occur when an update to a parti-
 cular contribution takes  more files than the  original con-
 tribution.  To this end,  if  a contribution is either shor-
 tened or withdrawn its place on the tape will be taken by an
 empty file,  as will the files of contribution moved because
 the number of its files increased.
      The remainder  of this file contains  documentation for
 each of the files on this  tape.  For each file number,  the
 contributor, the contribution date and a summary of the con-
 tents are given.  The last line  for each file gives the DCB
 attributes of the file (which are  the same as those for the
 reconstituted PDS if  applicable),  the type (either  PDS or
 SEQ) and the number of tracks required on a 3350 to hold the
 dataset in its original form.
0     Note that the BLKSIZE given is the BLKSIZE of the data-
 set on the tape.   When a PDS  is loaded from this file with
 the  program found  on file  4  or a  sequential dataset  is
 loaded with a  system utility,  any BLKSIZE  compatible with
 the LRECL, RECFM, and target DASD device may be used.
