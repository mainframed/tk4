This is the Contributed Program Library of the PL/I Project
of SHARE, Inc. It represents contributions by PL/I users to
the general community. There are many types of contributions
possible, from documentation of techniques to whole systems of
programs. As new contributions are made to this library, new
versions will be placed in the SHARE Program Library, from
where it can be ordered.
 In order to make the contributed programs available to as many
different systems as possible, all of the data on this tape is
in a simple sequential format, not an "unloaded" format.
For the same reason, the tape is unlabeled, and the documented
file numbers refer to actual physical files (i.e. tape marks).
The programs to unload an OS PDS to this format, as well as recreate
one from this format are present on the tape. However, due to the
simple format, it should be straightforward for anyone with a
system having a tape drive to use the data and programs on this tape.
 There are no load modules on the tape due to inconsistencies
between different systems. All of the data is in some printable
form, although some of it is upper and lower case. Upper and lower
case files will be designated.
 The first 10 files on this tape are reserved for the use of the
librarian. The remaining files are used to contain the contributions
in the different formats possible. The most common contribution
format is an OS PDS, which will be converted to a sequential file
with a line of text containing
.nf
.sp
.ce 1
    ./ ADD NAME=membernm
.sp
.fi
.pi 0
before each member. The other possible format is a simple sequential
file containing either documentation of some sort, or a program or
program segment.
.pi 5
 The major contributions on this tape will all have as part of
the distribution a documentation file of some sort. There might be
a sequential documentation file, such as this one, or a PDS of
documentation files to be printed, or a PDS of documentation to be
formatted using a text formatting processor.
 The relative positions of the various contributions on this tape
will remain constant through various updates of both this tape
and the individual contributions. The only exception to this rule
will occur when an update to a particular contribution takes more
files than the original contribution. To this end, if a contribution
is either shortened or withdrawn its place on the tape will be taken
by an empty file, as will the files of contribution moved
because the number of its files increased.
 The remainder of this file contains documentation for each of the
files on this tape. For each file number, the contributor, the
contribution date and a summary of the contents are given. The last
line for each file gives the DCB attributes of the file (which are
the same as those for the reconstituted PDS if applicable), the type
(either PDS or SEQ) and the number of tracks required on a 3350
to hold the dataset in its original form.
.sp
Note that the BLKSIZE given is
the BLKSIZE of the dataset on the tape.  When a PDS is loaded
from this file with the program found on file 4 or a sequential dataset
is loaded with a system utility,
any BLKSIZE
compatible with the LRECL, RECFM, and target DASD device may be used.
