//***FILE 260 is the documentation for the SHARE PL/1 Tape, which   *
//*           is no longer being supported by SHARE, so it has      *
//*           been transplanted here.  This file is an IEBUPDTE     *
//*           SYSIN-format pds (compressed), and it contains the    *
//*           contents of the first ten files of the SHARE PL/1     *
//*           Tape, which are mostly documentation.  Since these    *
//*           same materials, on the CBT Overflow Tape, occupy      *
//*           different file slots than they did on the original    *
//*           SHARE PL/1 Tape, a mapping follows, so you can see    *
//*           where the same files have been rearranged here.       *
//*                                                                 *
//*           Files 260 through 295 are devoted to the materials    *
//*           from the SHARE PL/1 Tape.  I've left File 270 empty,  *
//*           for expansion, if needed.  All the materials from     *
//*           the PL/1 tape have been moved to here.                *
//*                                                                 *
//*           Some of the files have been regrouped according to    *
//*           a logical plan.  The ABE Editor files, originally     *
//*           9 files on a tape, have been put together again.      *
//*           Separate files from other packages have been grouped  *
//*           together as pds members in one file, if this seemed   *
//*           logically like a good arrangement.                    *
//*                                                                 *
//*           These materials are now being supported by Sam        *
//*           Golob, so all the contributor information is now      *
//*           superseded.  Contributors should send contributions   *
