THIS FILE IS IN IEBCOPY UNLOAD FORMAT (80 X 32720).
     THIS VERSION OF THE COMMAND HAS A NUMBER OF ENHANCEMENTS AND
CLEANUP FIXES INSTALLED. THE SUPPORT FOR JES2 PRIOR TO 79/09 WAS REMOVED
AND THE CODE STANDARDIZED ON THE DUPLEX CHECKPOINT LEVEL. A SCREEN PRINT
FACILITY WAS ADDED. THE COMMAND RUNS AUTHORIZED AND NOW HAS SUPPORT FOR
CANCEL, REQUEUE, AND PURGE. THE PDDB SYSOUT COUNTS ARE LISTED ON THE DD
SUBCOMMAND. SUPPORT WAS ADDED TO FIND AND LIST TSO DYNAMICALLY SPUN
SYSOUT.
     THE COMMAND ONLY NEEDS TO RUN AUTHORIZED FOR THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS
CANCEL, REQUEUE, AND PURGE. IF YOU DO NOT MARK THE CODE AC=1, THE
PREVIOUS THREE COMMANDS WILL NOT FUNCTION.

INSTALLATION PROCEDURE FOR QUEUE:

     1. THERE ARE 38 MEMBERS IN THE DATASET.
        Q0 IS THE COMMON AREA.
        Q1 - Q28 ARE REENTRANT CODE.
        QCOMMON, QSTART, QSTOP, QTILT, QWTO, AND $JQT ARE MACROS.
        HELP IS A TSO HELP MEMBER.
        ASSEMBLE IS THE JCL TO ASSEMBLE AND LINK QUEUE.
        TABLE IS A SAMPLE SMP JOB TO AUTHORIZE THE QUEUE COMMAND.

     2. EDIT MEMBER QCOMMON CHANGING THE FOLLOWING PARAMETERS:

        UNIT=XXXX THE DEVICE TYPE FOR SYS1.HASPCKPT.
        VOLSER=YYYYYY THE VOLUME SERIAL FOR SYS1.HASPCKPT.
        SID1-SID7=ZZZZ THE SMF IDS FOR EACH CPU IN THE COMPLEX. THE
        IDS MUST BE IN THE SAME ORDER AS IN THE INITIALIZATION DECK.

        AT PRESENT THERE IS SUPPORT IN THE INITIALIZATION MODULE TO
        DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATE THE CHECKPOINT ON EITHER 3330, 3330-1,
        OR 3350. IF YOU ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE A DRUM YOU
        WILL HAVE TO MODIFY Q10 TO ADD SUPPORT.

        EDIT THE MACRO QSTART TO INDICATE THE OPTIONS DESIRED.

        QPFK SETB 0      NO PFK SUPPORT.
        QPFK SETB 1      PFK SUPPORT (DEFAULT).

        THE PFK SUPPORT IS FROM VILKO MACEK - INSURANCE CORPORATION
        OF BRITISH COLUMBIA. PFK SUPPORT CAN BE IDENTIFIED BY SOURCE
        MARKED WITH ICBC IN MODULES Q5, Q8, AND THE MACRO QCOMMON. TO
        CHANGE THE DEFINITIONS OF THE PFKS SEE THE END OF MODULE Q5.

        QACF2 SETB 0     NO ACF2 SUPPORT (DEFAULT).
        QACF2 SETB 1     ACF2 SUPPORT.

        THE ACF2 SUPPORT IS FROM KEN TRUE - FAIRCHILD CAMERA. KEN ALSO
        SUPPLIED THE ORIGINAL PRINT SUPPORT.

     3. EDIT MEMBER ASSEMBLE TO CHANGE THE JCL TO FIT YOUR STANDARDS.
        DO NOT ALTER THE ORDER OF THE ASSEMBLY SYSLIBS AS THERE IS A
        CONFLICT ON THE MACRO QSTART. THE ASSEMBLIES AND LINKS CREATE
        2 LOAD MODULES.

        QUEUE (ALIAS Q) - IS THE REENTRANT CODE OF THE COMMAND. IT MAY
        BE PLACED IN SYS1.LPALIB OR ANY OTHER AUTHORIZED LIBRARY WITH
        AN AUTHORIZATION CODE OF 1.

        QUEUECMN - THE MODIFIABLE COMMON AREA. CAN BE PLACED IN SYS1.
        LINKLIB OR SYS1.CMDLIB. IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE NAME OF
        QUEUECMN LOOK IN MEMBER Q10 WHERE THE LINK IS ISSUED.

     4. ADD QUEUE ALIAS Q TO THE IKJEFTE2 MODULE WHICH IS THE TSO LIST
        OF AUTHORIZED COMMANDS. A SAMPLE SMP JOB IS PROVIDED IN THE
        MEMBER TABLE. QUEUE CAN BE RUN UNDER SPF BUT THE SUBCOMMANDS
        USING THE SUBSYSTEM INTERFACE (CANCEL, REQUEUE, AND DELETE)
        WILL BE INOPERABLE, ALL OTHER COMMANDS WILL FUNCTION NORMALLY.
        IF YOU DON'T MIND THE INTEGRITY PROBLEM YOU CAN ADD CODE TO
        QUEUE TO USE A SPECIAL SVC TO GET INTO SUPERVISOR STATE AND
        HAVE FULL FACILITY UNDER SPF.

     5. QUEUE NOW SUPPORTS 3278-2, -3, -4, -5, AND 3279-2, -3. QUEUE
        DETERMINES THE ROWS AND COLUMNS BASED ON RESULTS FROM THE
        TSO GTSIZE MACRO. MODEL1 TERMINALS ARE NOT SUPPORTED.  SEVERAL
        MODIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS:

        DI,AI,HI,DO,AO - INCLUDED IN THE DISPLAY ARE FCB, UCS, FORMS
                         INFORMATION. IN ADDITION A LIMITED DISPLAY
                         CAN BE ACHIEVED BY QUALIFYING OPERANDS. EXAM-
                         INE THE HELP MEMBER FOR THOSE OPERANDS.

        OP             - NEW COMMAND. OP SETS THE DISPLAY OPTIONS FOR
                         A SYSOUT DATASET. VALID OPERANDS ARE:

                          BLANKS/NOBLANKS - BLANKS SAYS LIST ALL LINES
                                            WHETHER THEY ARE BLANK OR
                                            NOT. NOBLANKS SAYS LIST 1
                                            BLANK LINE WHEN 2 OR MORE
                                            LINES ARE ENCOUNTERED.

                          OVERFLOW/NOOVER - OVERFLOW SAYS LIST THE EN-
                                            TIRE LINE(RELATIVE TO THE
                                            'CO' COMMAND) WITH OVERFLOW
                                            CONTINUED ON THE NEXT LINE.
                                            NOOVER SAYS TRUNCATE THE
                                            LINE IF IT WILL NOT FIT ON
                                            THE DISPLAY.

NOTE:  THE QUEUE COMMAND WAS WRITTEN FOR JES2 4.1 AT PUT TAPE 79/09
LEVEL WITH THE DUPLEX CHECKPOINT FACILITY (AZ27300). THERE IS NO REASON
THAT THE CONCEPT OF ACCESSING THE CHECKPOINT AND SPOOL WOULD NOT WORK
WITH EARLIER VERSIONS OF JES2 OR WITH NJE. THE LOCATION OF CHECKPOINT
VARIABLES AND CHECKPOINT AND SPOOL STRUCTURE MAY BE DIFFERENT AND THE
USER WILL HAVE TO MAKE APPROPRIATE CHANGES TO SUPPORT OTHER VERSIONS
OF JES2.
