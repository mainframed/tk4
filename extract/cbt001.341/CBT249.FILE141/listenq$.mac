)F FUNCTION:                                                rgn 08-20-82
  The LISTENQ COMMAND returns information reqarding allocations for a
             job or userid.  It tells you what dataset(s) the job has
             allocated, and how it is allocated (OLD or SHARE). It will
             also tell what datasets the job or user may be waiting on.

          Outputs:
             XYZ.ABC.DEF               ALLOCATED SHR
                  means the job scanned has 'XYZ.ZBC.DEF' SHR.

             ABC.DEF.GHI               ALLOCATED OLD
                  means the job scanned has 'ABC.DEF.GHI' OLD.

             ABC.TRS.XYZ               WAITING   SHR.
                  means the job scanned wants dataset 'ABC.TRS.XYZ'
                  allocated SHARE, but the dataset is currently
                  allocated old to another job

          Return codes:
             0 - indicates job found in execution. All conflicts(if any)
                 have been listed.

             4 - indicates job not found in execution.
