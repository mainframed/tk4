)F FUNCTION:                                                rgn 04-04-82
  The WAITR COMMAND returns information reqarding enq conflicts for a
             job or userid.  It tells you what dataset(s) the job is
             waiting on, and how it is waiting (OLD or SHARE). It will
             also tell what dataset the job or user holds that other
             jobs may be waiting on.  Once this is known a command such
             as DSN can be used to see who has the dataset tied up or
             who is waiting on it. At this point the FREE or FREEALL
             commands can be used to free it.

          Outputs:
             JOB IS WAITING OLD FOR DSN = XYZ.ABC.DEF
                  means the job scanned wants 'XYZ.ZBC.DEF' OLD,
                  someone has it SHARED.

             JOB IS WAITING SHR FOR DSN = ABC.DEF.GHI
                  means the job scanned wants 'ABC.DEF.GHI' SHARED,
                  someone has it OLD.

             JOB(S) WAITING FOR DSN = ABC.TRS.XYZ, ALLOCATED SHR.
                  means the job scanned has the dataset 'ABC.TRS.XYZ'
                  allocated SHARE, at least one job wants it OLD.

             JOB(S) WAITING FOR DSN = DEF.ABC.GHI, ALLOCATED OLD.
                  means the job scanned has the dataset 'DEF.ABC.GHI'
                  allocated OLD, at least one job wants it SHARED.

          Return codes:
             0 - indicates job found in execution. All conflicts(if any)
                 have been listed.

             4 - indicates job not found in execution.

             8 - indicates a parsing error occurred, re-enter command.
