    THIS PROGRAM ANALYZES THE TSO BROADCAST DATASET.  IT
    DISPLAYS THE NUMBER OF AVAILABLE BLOCKS AND HOW THEY
    ARE USED.  IT ALSO DISPLAYS THE TSO USERS WHO HAVE
    MESSAGES WAITING.  IN ADDITION IT ALSO DOES A VALIDITY
    CHECK ON RECORDS WHICH ARE IN THE MESSAGE POOL TO ASSURE
    THEY ARE CHAINED OFF OF A USER RECORD.  ACCORDING TO
    DOCUMENTATION, INSTANCES OCCUR WHICH CAN RESULT IN THESE
    GARBAGE RECORDS EXISTING.
