.section 'BDT/MVS Testing Under VM'
.sp 1
A BDT proc and a TQI proc have been set up for testing on VM.
They are BDTP and TQIP. The calling parameters are listed.
.point begin
S BDTP,BDTID=n   where n = 1 for WCC1 and 2 for WCC2.
.point
S TQIP,BDTID=n,SYSID=x where n = 1 for WCC1 and 2 for WCC2 and
x if the cpuid which TQI is running.
.point end
.sp 1
.pp
The procedure to test BDT on VM follows:
.point begin
If BDT between two CPU's, define the CTC.
.point 2
#CP DEF CTC 1C0    (on MVSx)
.point
#cp DEF CTC 1C0    (on MVSy)
.point
#CP COUPLE 1C0 MVSx 1C0  (on MVSx)
.point
The defining of the CTC can be done after IPL, but the
channels and UCB's will have to be varied on.
.point 1
IPL MVS
.point
Supply the system parameters.
.point  2
R 0,SYSP=BA,LNK=(00,XB,XP) for BDTP with BDTID=1
.point
R 0,SYSP=BB,LNK=(00,XB,XP) for BDTP with BDTID=2
.point 1
Bring up JES3 as documented with SLOAD=AVJESX, PROD=PROD131,
and TEST=TEST131.
.point
Start VTAM
.point 2
S JES3NET,,,(COLD,LIST=60)     (on the CPU L, BDTID=1 were SYSP=BA
.point
S JES3NET,,,(COLD,LIST=49)     (on the CPU M, BDTID=2 were SYSP=BB
.point
If communication across the CTC is required, and VTAM was started after
the CTC's were defined, vary the CTC's active on VTAM
.point 3
V NET,ACT,ID=Y"#CTCA49         (on the CPU M with BDTID=2),SYSP=BB
.point
V NET,ACT,ID=Y"#CTCA60         (on the CPU L with BDTID=1),SYSP=BA
.point 1
Start BDT
.point 2
S BDTP,BDTID=n where n = 1 for WCC1 or 2 for WCC2
.point
BDT can come up cold, warm, or hot.  If cold or warm is specified,
the init decks are specified later as R nn,M=BDTWCCxP where x = 1
for WCC1 or 2 for WCC2. A message will indicate when the start is
complete.
.point 1
TQI must be started.  It can be started before, concurrently, or after
BDT is started.  Start TQI for each BDT.  S TQIP,BDTID=n,SYSID=x where
n = 1 for WCC1 or 2 for WCC2 and x = L for SYSP=BA or M for SYSP=BB.
.point
If only intra node testing is needed, BDT commands and transactions
can be issued.  To talk to BDT, prefix console commands with
'+'.
.point
If testing between two BDT's is required, SNA must be called and the
nodes started.
.point 2
+X SNA     on both guest machines
.point
+S SNA,NODE=WCCnP  (where n = 1 or 2, and defines which node
a session is desired with.)   The command
should be entered on both nodes which need the session.
.point end
