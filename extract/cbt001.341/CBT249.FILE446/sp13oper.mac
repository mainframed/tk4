JES3 SP 1.3.1 Production Test Operations Procedures for WCC1
.ur &sysdate
(final)
.sp 2
.pp
Saturday December 17, is scheduled to be a weekend production
test of JES3 version 1.3.1 on WCC1.
This new release is a major change from
the current SU26 version of JES3, but has few operational differences.
This test will require a JES3 WARM start to install JES3 SP 1.3.1
and another JES3 WARM start to return to JES3 SU26.
.pp
If problems occur, immediately contact one of the JES3 System
Programmers who will be providing onsite coverage of this test.
.point begin
Prior to doing the warmstart for SP 1.3.1, the following should be
done:
.point 2
Run EREP
.point
Run LOGWTR
.point
Note: An abend DM731 may occur for jobs that were on a writer in SU26
when you bring down SU26 and then bring up SP 1.3.1.
.us In order to avoid this problem:
.point 3
.us Quiesce all writers on SU26 system by:
.point
*F X D=WTR,MC=0 to set the writer count to zero
.point
or *V nnn,OFF
.point
or *R nnn,RSCD  (options C and N MUST NOT BE ENTERED)
.point 2
Issue *I Q,N=ALL    and save the MLOG
.point end

Below is documented the changes required for operations to support this
production test.

IPL all CPUs on WCC1.
.point

.point 2
The SYSP of xx is the normal SYSP for that processor and role.
.point 1
To warmstart JES3 on WCC1 Enter:

.point
R nn,W for the Global processor.
.sp
R nn,L for the Local processors.
.point 2
The reply for the INITDECK on the Global is to be M=SP.

Some of the new operational changes that are important
.boxoff
.sp
.point begin
The cancel with print command has changed.
.point 2
*F J/xxx,CP  will now cancel the job AND all punch AND TSO output.
.point 2
*F J/xxx,CO  will now cancel the job AND retain punch and keep the
TSO output.
.point 3
*F J/xxx,CO works the way *F J/xxx,CP worked in SU26.
.point 1
If JES3 encounters a console buffer shortage the following will
happen:
.point 2
Message IAT7185 will be displayed on the JES3 console.  The format is:
.sp
IAT7185 D: ccc nnn ccc nnn H: ccc E: ccc Q/T:ddd  mm:ss
.sp;
.point 3
Where D: is an abbreviation for the word DEPTH
.point
Where ccc is the name of a JES3 console with the greatest and next
greatest depth.
.point
Where nnn is the number of messages queued to console ccc.
.point
Where H is an abbreviation for the word HOLD.  The following ccc is
the name of console in HOLD or NONE.
.point
Where E is an abbreviation for the word ERROR.  The following ccc is
the name of console in ERROR status or NONE.
.point
Where Q/T: is an abbreviation for the words QUEUE/TIME.
.point
Where ddd is the number of messages waiting to be written on the
current console.
.point
Where mm:ss is the estimated time in minutes and seconds required to
display the number of messages shown in ddd.
.point 2
If this happens then you can use a new form of the *FREE command to
free messages queued to another console.  The format is:
.point 3
*FREE consolename
.point 1
Some of the Inquiry displays have changed.
.point 2
There are some new NJE inquiry commands.
.point 3
*I NJE,NAME=nodename
.point
Response: IAT8659 NODE nodename HOLD/NOHOLD PATH pathname
DEFINED LINE linename
.point
The NAME= parameter used to be a Rockwell unique parameter.  IBM
has now picked it up and the response will be IBM's.
.point
*I NJE,NAME=nodename,LINE
.point
Response: IAT8660 NODE nodename ACTIVE LINES linename RCV/NORCV
.point
*I NJE NAME=nodename,SNDR
.point
Response: IAT8661 NODE nodename NJESNDR sendername
.point
The Rockwell Command *I NJE,NODE=nodename is still valid.
.point
Response: RAT9578 node JOB jobname jobnumber TRANSMISSION BUFFERS = nnn
CHARS = nnn
.point
This used to be the same as *I NJE,NAME=nodename.
.point 1
JES3 now has the ability to restrict the maximum number of DD's which
a job can have and the maximum number of DD's allowed in all CI's at
one time.
.point 2
JES3 command *I X D=CI will display these values.
.point 3
The maximum for any single job is 500.
.point
The maximum for all CI's is 1500.
.point 2
If CI gets hung and you need to start another to get a hot job thru
you can modify these values, BUT be careful since by increasing these
you expose JES3 to abend 80A's or 6FB's.
.point 3
JES3 command *F X D=CI,MAXJOBDD=xxxxx,MAXSYSDD=xxxxx will reset these
values.
.point 1
You may now repeat the last input command via PA2.

.us Attachment A: Spool Visibility Enhancements
.sp 2
.pp
In order to increase visibility to a duplicate track problem, the
following messages will be written to MLOG and/or the console.
.pp
After JES3 Initialization has completed processing the initdeck,
multiple lines of the following message will be printed:
.point begin
TRKPURG ..........
.point end
.pp
If an error condition is encountered the following messages may be
printed on the MLOG and the console.
.point begin
TRKDUP JOB=nnnn TRK=nnnnnnnn DSP=xxx
.point
or TRKDUP1 POTENTIAL DUPLICATE JOB=nnnn
.point
or IPURGE JDS ........
.point
or IPURGE JCT ........
.point end
.pp
If any of these error messages are generated, save the MLOG and note
the time of the error, then notify the JES3 systems programmers.
.sp
.us NOTE:
The TRKPURG message is just an informational message and no action is
required.  It does not indicate any problem but provides information
which may prove useful in analyzing a problem should one occur.
