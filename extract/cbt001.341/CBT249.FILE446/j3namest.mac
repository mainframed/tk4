.chapter 'JES3 Naming Standards'
.pp
This section documents the naming standards for Rockwell developed
macros, modules, exits, messages, etc. within the JES3 system.
.sp 2
.section  'COPY elements'
.pp
The name of COPY macros should be the name of the module name
less the IAT plus a 3 character numeric suffix.
.boxon
I.e. for Two COPY's in IATSSDI the first would be SSDI001 and
the second would be SSDI002.
.boxoff
.pp
NOTE: Insure that the copy name which is really a macro has
a unique name by coordinating with anyone else working
on the same module and by checking JES3.SP131.JES3MAC...
