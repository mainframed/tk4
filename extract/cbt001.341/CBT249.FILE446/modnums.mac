.Section 'Assignment of USERMOD ID's'
.sp
.pp
The assignment of a USERMOD id takes place under the TRACKING option
of the source maintenance ISPF panel. This function places the user
into ISPF EDIT on the JES3.MODS.LOG(TRACKING) dataset.  This is a
sequential file containing the modid followed by the programmer name
assigned to the mod, which is then followed by a brief description
of the modification (a 1 liner).
.pp
The modid that you assign is the SJxxx portion of the USERMOD.  The y
and z are used to delineate deltas of the base modid.
.pp
The y, at this time, may remain the letter A for every module/macro
element in the SMP USERMOD.  Or y may be a distinct letter, one for
each element.  The former requires a single SMP USERMOD and the later
requires a seperate SMP USERMOD for every element.
.pp
The z is a change designation, where 0 indicates the base or original
mod and where 1 - nth indicates the 1st through nth change/fix or
enhancement to the original modification.
.pp
If you choose to assign y the letter A for all elements, then when
you invoke the USERMOD create function (CUMOD).  The first time you
execute CUMOD for the USERMOD the MERGE option should be set to
NO, for the second through nth elements the MERGE option should be
set to YES.
