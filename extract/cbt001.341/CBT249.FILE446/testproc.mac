.chapter 'Testing Procedures and Guidelines'
.pp
This chapter describes the guidelines for testing modifications to
JES3.
.pp
All modifications must be tested to determine if the mod works and
if it causes any unexpected changes elsewhere.
.pp
Testing will be performed using the MVS test system available under VM
as described in chapter
.ur &vmchap..
.pp
A test job or test case description should be placed into JES3.DRVM.CNTL
under the name of the modification to be tested (i.e. for SJ091A0 the
member name would be SJ091A0).  This job(s) should attempt to verify
every possible combination of factors which could cause your
modification to fail.  The description is applicable for any mod where
a job cannot be used for the testing.
.pp
For Control Block modifications a CBPRNT should be included in the
job.
.pp
For new messages, a comment in the JCL or description should explain
what the message is and what causes it to be issued.
