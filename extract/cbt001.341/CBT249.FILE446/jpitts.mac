.point
Bring up JES3
.point
Enter *X RJP
.point 2
To find the status of 0B6 and 0B7:
Enter:
UCB 0B6,0B7
.point
And if they are offline--
Enter:

.subsection 'Starting RJP'
.point 1
Enter *S RJP,L=LINE0B6
.point
Enter *V 00B,ON,L
.point
Enter *V 00C,ON,L
.subsection 'Starting JPITTS'
.point 1
Enter s JPITTS,0B7
.point 2
This will cause the terminal program to start.
The terminal program will initialize and issue a message to enter
the terminal id.
.point 1
Reply to it by:  R nn,RM090
.point 2
The terminal program will initialize and establish communications
with RM090.
.point 1
Enter F JPITTS,S,PR1,00B  this will allocate printer 00B as RM090PR1.
.point 2
Enter R nn,PN to message IEC123D 00B,SPECIFY UCS PARAMETER.
.point 1
Enter F JPITTS,S,RD1,00C  this will allocate reader 00C as RM090RD1.

Read your input stream from CMS.
.point 2
Log on to your CMS id.
.point
Issue #CP SP PUN MVSx  where MVSx is your MVS id.
.point
Issue PUN xxxxxx
.point 3
where xxxxxx is the name of the CMS file
containing your test job.
.point 1
Enter F JPITTS,S,RD1,00C  each time you wish to read a job.
.point 2
.point 1
You can communicate with the terminal by responding to the outstanding
reply (E.G.  R nn,*S PR2).
This is the same as entering  *S RM090PR2 on the global.
