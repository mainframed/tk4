.chapter 'JES3 Initialization Deck Maintenance'
.pp
This chapter documents how to modify the JES3 Initialization Deck and to
test the Initdeck using the IPO INITDECK Checker.
.pp
This procedure requires the use of ISPF with the JES3 ISPF libraries.

1.  You first need to allocate the appropriate libraries and tables
    to be able to use the INITDECK panels.
           EX 'JES3.CLIST(JES3PDF)'
           ISPSTART

1.  Access the AOST panels.
    Select J - JES3
    Select 1 - INITDECK
    Select 5 - EDIT and enter the computing center (WCC1 or WCC2)
               you wish to edit.

2.  In this dataset you will find the init deck broken down into four
    sections:  DECKXY, DEVICEXY, NJEXY, and RJPXY.
    - Where XY denotes the level:  X = 1 (for WCC1)
                                       2 (for WCC2)
                                   Y = 0 (production)
                                       1 (backup)
                                       F (currently being worked on).

3.  When you change one of the sections:
    - Create member at level 1F for WCC1 or 2F for WCC2 (ex. S DECK1F).
    - Copy the production level X0 (ex. COPY DECK10).
    - Make modifications.

4.  After all the mods are made to the sections:
    - Create member called JES3IN1F for WCC1 or JES3IN2F for WCC2.
      Merge all the sections together.

        Example:
                    S JES3IN1F
                    COPY DECK1F
                    FIND &
                    COPY DEVICE1F after the &
                    FIND &
                    COPY NJE1F after the &
                    FIND &
                    COPY RJP1F after the &
                    END
      * Note:  If there isn't a XF level, then copy in the X0 level.

    - This will be the new initdeck and is now ready to test

6.  Now you are ready to run the initdeck checker.
    - Select 6 - INITDRVR.
    - Fill in computing center, suffix, and queue type.
    - Hit enter and wait for several minutes.
    - The initialization deck errors will appear on the screen.  The
      whole initialization deck listing will be in 'JES3.INITDECK.
      computing-center-name.LIST'.  You can scan this by selecting
      7 - SCAN in the INITDECK panel.  From here you can scan the
      errors or browse the whole initdeck listing.

7.  When you are ready to move the initdeck to the production library,
    select 8 - PROD.  Specify the computing center and the suffix.

8.  Before the warmstart, change 'JES3.PARMLIB' as follows:
    - Delete JES3IN01.
    - Rename JES3IN00 to JES3IN01.
    - Rename the new initdeck (JES3IN1F or JES3IN2F) to JES3IN00.

9.  Rename the initdeck sections after the warmstart to reflect the
    current levels and backup levels.
      Example:
                  Delete DECKX1
                  Rename DECKX0 to DECKX1
                  Rename DECKXF to DECKX0
                  Where X = 1 (WCC1) or 2 (WCC2)
