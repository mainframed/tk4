.Section 'NJE testing to an RSCS node'
The following is the procedure for bringing up an
RSCS node under VM.
.point begin
Change the NJERMT card for WCC4 in an init deck in APARMLIB.
.point 2
Change to CTC=YES.
.point
Delete LINE=xxxxxxx.
.point 1
IPL MVS and start JES3 using the new init deck.
.point 1
Logon a CMS id.   (cmsid1)
.point 1
Define the virtual CTC
.point 2
DEF CTC 130 (on cmsid1)
.point
#cp DEF CTC 1C0 (on MVSx)
.point
COUPLE 130 MVSx 1C0 (on cmsid1)
.point
Vary the channel and device for 1C0 on to MVS (on MVSx)
.point
Vary 1C0 on to JES3 (on MVSx)
.point 1
Get access to RSCS's 191 disk.
.point 2
LINK RSCS 191 vaddr RR (on cmsid1, password = RD)
.point 1
IPL vaddr  (vaddr from above on cmsid1)
.point 1
START WCC LINE 130 PARM BUFF=1200  (on cmsid1)
.point 1
*X NJE,N=WCC4,L=NJE1C0 (on cmsid1)
.point end
To test the NJE functions, use the following procedure:
.point begin
On another CMS id (cmsid2), enter the following commands,
.point 2
SP PRT to cmsid1
.point
SP PUN to cmsid1
.point
TAG DEV PUN WCC JOB
.point
TAG DEV PRT WCC LOCAL 05
.point 1
Punch a JCL file.  The job should run on the MVSid and the output should
end up in cmsid2's reader, unless the JCL specifies differently.
.point
Print a file.  The file should print on a JES3 writer on the MVS id.
.point end
