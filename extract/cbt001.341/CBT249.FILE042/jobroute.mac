)F JOB OUTPUT MULTIPLE ROUTING FACILITY

  IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN POSSIBLE TO MULTIPLY ROUTE (AMONGST MANY OTHER
  SPECIFICATIONS) DATASET GROUPS BY FORMS NUMBER VIA THE /*OUTPUT
  CONTROL CARD, BUT THE IMPLEMENTATION WOULD NOT WORK FOR THE JOB
  STANDARD SETUP OUTPUT (I.E., 'JOB FORMS').  THIS EXTENSION ALLOWS
  THE SPECIFICATION OF A /*OUTPUT CONTROL CARD FOR THE FORMS TYPE
  SPECIFIED ON THE /*JOBPARM CONTROL CARD AS THE JOB FORMS, OR FOR
  THE DEFAULT JOB FORMS 'STD.' (IN WHICH CASE THE JOBPARM
  CARD IS NOT REQUIRED).  A PSEUDO-FORMS OF 'JCL ' IS ALSO DEFINED,
  WITH THE SPECIAL MEANING OF JOB LOG, JCL, AND SYSTEM MESSAGES ONLY.

  THIS FACILITY WAS IMPLEMENTED FOR TWO PRIMARY REASONS:

  (1)  TO ALLOW COPIES OF A COMPLETE JOB INCLUDING JCL, ETC.,
       TO BE ROUTED TO TWO DIFFERENT DESTINATIONS (FOR EXAMPLE,
       ISD AND LOCAL) TO AID IN PROBLEM DETERMINATION; PROVIDE
       CONVENIENT DOCUMENTATION TO PARTIES IN MULTIPLE
       LOCATIONS, ETC.)

  (2)  TO MULTIPLY ROUTE A JOB'S JOB LOG, JCL, AND SYSTEM MESSAGES
       (OR ALL OF ITS STANDARD SETUP OUTPUT, IF DESIRED) TO ALLOW
       ARCHIVING OF PRODUCTION JOB RUN INFORMATION TO MICROFICHE
       WITHOUT LOSING THE ABILITY TO GET AN IMMEDIATE COPY OF THE
       OUTPUT FOR RUN VERIFICATION.

)X SPECIFICATION OF MULTIPLE ROUTING

  SPECIFYING MULTIPLE ROUTING FOR JOB LOG/JCL/SYSTEM MESSAGES:

     //JOBNAME JOB .......JOB CARD PARAMETERS.............
     /*JOBPARM FORMS=JCL <,OTHER JOBPARM PARAMETERS>
     /*OUTPUT JCL DEST=(DEST1,DEST2,.......) <,OTHER OUTPUT PARAMETERS>
     ......REMAINDER OF JOB......

  SPECIFYING MULTIPLE ROUTING FOR ALL OF JOB'S STANDARD OUTPUT:

     //JOBNAME JOB ......JOB CARD PARAMETERS............
     /*OUTPUT STD. DEST=(DEST1,DEST2,.....) <,OTHER OUTPUT PARAMETERS>
     ......REMAINDER OF JOB......

)O CONSIDERATIONS:                                                     1

))DEST       - IN THE ABOVE EXAMPLE, 'DEST1', 'DEST2', ETC., REFER
               TO ANY VALID JES2 DESTINATIONS.  SUCH DESTINATIONS
               INCLUDE:

               R0, LOCAL, CENTRAL              DATA CENTER
               U1, ISD                         APPL. DIVISION PARADYNE
               R1, FICHE                       PSEUDO-REMOTE FOR FICHE

               FOR A COMPLETE LISTING OF VALID JES2 ROUTE CODES AND
               DESTINATIONS WITH EQUIVALENT SYMBOLIC DESTINATION
               DESTIDS, SEE HELP FOR 'JESDESTS'.

))JCL        - WHEN THE PSEUDO-FORMS OF 'JCL ' IS USED, THE JOB LOG,
               JCL, AND SYSTEM MESSAGES WILL PRINT TOGETHER BUT AS A
               SEPARATE OUTPUT GROUP FROM ANY STANDARD-SETUP
               SYSOUT (WHICH WOULD NORMALLY PRINT WITH THE JCL, ETC.,
               AS ONE OUTPUT GROUP IF THE SYSOUT CLASS AND MSGCLASS
               WERE THE SAME).

))STD.       - WHEN USING /*OUTPUT STD. TO ROUTE ALL STANDARD SETUP
               MULTIPLY (OR SPECIFY OTHER /*OUTPUT CARD PARAMETERS)
               REMEMBER THAT THIS WILL AFFECT ALL 'STD.' REGARDLESS
               OF SYSOUT CLASS -- I.E., ANYTHING WITHOUT A FORMS
               SPECIFIED WILL BE INCLUDED.  IF ONE OF THE ROUTE
               DESTINATIONS DOESN''T HANDLE MULTIPLE CLASSES AND
               MULTIPLE OUTPUT CLASSES GET INCLUDED, THIS COULD GET
               CONFUSING TO THE OPERATIONS STAFF.

))EXAMPLES   - THE FOLLOWING ARE EXAMPLES OF USE OF THE JOBFORMS /
               /*OUTPUT FACILITY:

               PRINT JOB JCL/MSGS AND PUT ON FICHE ARCHIVE:

               //MYJOB    JOB (D,815-7326,815-7326),DCT,CLASS=G
               /*JOBPARM FORMS=JCL,LINES=1
               /*OUTPUT JCL DEST=(LOCAL,FICHE)
               //QAUICK EXEC BLITZEN,SYS=A158

               ROUTE ALL OF JOB TO TWO LOCATIONS

               //TESTJOB  JOB 780799,'AXB ABE BAXTYER',CLASS=Q
               /*OUTPUT STD. DEST=(LOCAL,ISD)
               //*PROCLIB BAXTYER.PDS.CNTL
               //BUMPROC  EXEC Q6666

               PRINT MANY COPIES OF JCL/MSGS FOR NO PARTICULAR REASON:

               //BIZARRE  JOB 789123,'DCT DAVE'
               /*JOBPARM FORMS=JCL
               /*OUTPUT JCL COPIES=21
               //PRINT  EXEC PRTHELP,H=JOBROUTE
