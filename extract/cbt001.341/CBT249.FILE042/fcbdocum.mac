                   3211 Printer FCB Image Maintenance

     For those installations having IBM 3211 printers installed,
     there has been no easy way to define forms control buffer
     images. The enclosed software provides a simple way of defining
     new FCB images and displaying existing FCB images. The source
     consists of a macro ($FCB) which can be assembled to define an
     FCB image; and a program (FCBSNOOP) which can be used to display
     FCB images already defined in SYS1.IMAGELIB. The output from
     FCBSNOOP is in the format of $FCB macro calls. This provides
     documentation and a means for easily modifying existing FCB
     images.

     The format of the data on the enclosed DTR is as follows:

      a)  The tape is unlabelled and was recorded on a 9 track, 1600
          BPI tape drive.

      b)  File 1 contains a copy of this writeup in upper and lower
          case (TN) format. The file contains approximately 300
          records and the DCB parameters are: RECFM=FBA, LRECL=133,
          BLKSIZE=3990.

      c)  File 2 contains the assembler source for the $FCB macro.
          The file contains approximately 600 records and the DCB
          parameters are: RECFM=FB, LRECL=80, BLKSIZE=4080.

      d)  File 3 contains the assembler source for the FCBSNOOP
          program. The file contains approximately 1000 records and
          the DCB parameters are: RECFM=FB, LRECL=80, BLKSIZE=4080.

     Note: We are likely going to install a 3800 printer in the
     fourth quarter of 1977. If the IEBIMAGE utility program does not
     meet our requirements, we intend on writing software that does.

                   $FCB - Define Forms Control Buffer

     The $FCB macro instruction will generate a control section which
     defines a forms control buffer image for a 3211 printer. The
     macro may be used in a stand alone assembly, and link edited to
     produce an FCB image load module in SYS1.IMAGELIB.

     This macro was developed using the $FCB macro distributed with
     HASP II Version 4. The distributed macro was written to generate
     in-line code within HASP. Further, it did not support left
     indexing. (For more information about that macro, refer to
     "OS/VS2 HASP II Version 4 Logic", IBM form number GY27-7255.)

     Usage

           FCB2???? $FCB  i,p,c-l,c-l,...,INDEX=x,DEFAULT=YES

        ???? - The 4 character image name which will be coded in JCL
               and in operator commands.

        i -    The number of lines per inch. This value must be coded
               as either 6 or 8.

        p -    The number of lines per page. This corresponds to the
               number of lines per fold on the form. This means that
               for a 22 line page, where the forms are folded once in
               three pages, this parameter would be coded as 66. The
               carriage channel punches would then be repeated three
               times in the FCB image - once for each page. This
               value must range between 2 and 180.

        c-l -  Carriage punch -- line number. This parameter should
               be specified once for every channel punch required.
               The parameter is coded by specifying the channel
               number followed by a hyphen (-) and then the line
               number. The channel number must range between 1 and
               12. Channel 1 must be specified at least once. The
               line number must be a value between 1 and the number
               of lines per page specified.

        x -    The index amount. The keyword parameter "INDEX=x" can
               be omitted. If it is, then no indexing will be
               performed. If specified, x can be a value from 1 to 31
               inclusive for right indexing; or -1 to -31 for left
               indexing. Right indexing means that x is the number of
               the printer print position where the first character
               of the output record will be printed. Left indexing
               means that x is the number of the data byte that is
               printed in printer print position one.

1                                                                   3



        YES -  Indicates that this is to be a default image. The
               keyword parameter "DEFAULT=YES" can be omitted. If it
               is omitted, the image will not be defined as a default
               image. If a default image is loaded into the printer
               and a job does not request a specific FCB, then the
               job will be printed using the FCB that is loaded. This
               implies that for all special forms FCB images, this
               parameter should not be coded.
+                               ___

     Notes

          Note the significance of the channel 1 punch. It is
          required by the printer for the carriage restore function.
          Further, consider what would happen if channel 1 is defined
          in line 6. With JES2, an FCB is loaded after the separator
          page is printed. At that time, the forms are positioned at
          the first print line on a page. When the buffer load
          occurs, the printer assumes the forms are positioned at
          line 1. A skip to channel 1 will cause the printer to space
          5 lines. Thus, the first print line is now 5 lines down the
          page from where it should be. All output printed from now
          until an operator notices will be skewed by 5 lines. It is
          recommended that channel one be defined at line one for all
          FCB's. Then this problem will not occur.

          Unspecified channels will be automatically included by the
          macro if sufficient lines are available to do so. This will
          prevent forms runaway.

               //ASM.SYSIN DD *
               FCB2LIN6 $FCB  6,66,1-1,2-7,3-28,12-57,12-59

             FCBSNOOP - Display Forms Control Buffer Definitions

     This program will display all 3211 printer forms control buffer
     definitions (FCB's) present in SYS1.IMAGELIB. The output
     produced is in a format suitable for input to the system
     assembler. It could be used to regenerate any or all FCB'S in
     the library.

     Output Format

          The output consists of unblocked 80 byte records. The
          output for each FCB image consists of:

           a)  The assembler source necessary to reassemble the FCB.
               It is in the form of a macro call to the macro $FCB.

           b)  The linkage editor control card. It is a name card for
               the FCB with the replace option specified.

           c)  If an alias for an FCB image is found, then a message
               is produced on SYSPUNCH indicating this. No further
               processing is performed for the alias.

     Usage

          The program requires two DD cards for execution:

           a)  IMAGELIB - Pointing to SYS1.IMAGELIB
           b)  SYSPUNCH - Pointing to the output data set.

          Parameters: If no parameters are specified on the EXEC
          card, then every FCB image in the library will be
          processed. Optionally, only specific FCB images need be
          processed. To do this, supply a list of names for those FCB
          images required. The names in the list must be separated by
          commas, and no embedded blanks are allowed. The names can
          be specified as "FCB2x" or "x", where "x" is the FCB code.

          An example:

               //LIST EXEC PGM=FCBSNOOP,PARM='STD,C060,FCB2AAAA'
               //IMAGELIB DD DSN=SYS1.IMAGELIB,DISP=SHR
               //SYSPUNCH DD SYSOUT=A

          This will produce the $FCB macro calls for the FCB codes
          STD, C060, and AAAA.

     Abends

          The program will abend with a user 100 completion code if
          it determines that it cannot continue. An error message
          will be written explaining the nature of the problem.

     Error Messages

           1.  SYSPUNCH DCB failed to open - will cause a user 100
               abend.

           2.  IMAGELIB DCB failed to open for directory search -
               will cause a user 100 abend.

           3.  IMAGELIB DCB failed to open for loading - will cause a
               user 100 abend.

           4.  Parameter field cannot exceed 100 characters in length
               - will cause a user 100 abend.
