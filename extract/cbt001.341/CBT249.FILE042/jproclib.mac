)F PRIVATE PROCEDURE LIBRARIES (PROCLIBS):

  ANY PARTITIONED DATASET (RECFM=FB,LRECL=80, AND BLKSIZE LESS THAN
  4140) WHICH BELONGS TO A JOB SUBMITTOR OR TO WHICH READ ACCESS IS
  LEGAL MAY BE USED AS A PRIVATE PROCEDURE LIBRARY BY INCLUDING A
  //*PROCLIB CONTROL CARD IN THE JOB.  IF A //*PROCLIB CONTROL CARD
  IS ENCOUNTERED WHEN THE JOB IS READ, IT WILL BE CONCATENATED
  *AHEAD* OF THE PROCEDURE LIBRARIES CONNECTED TO JES2 AND ANY
  INVOKED PROCEDURES WILL BE EXTRACTED FROM THE PRIVATE LIBRARY.  IF
  NOT FOUND IN THE PRIVATE LIBRARY, JES2 WILL EXTRACT THE PROCEDURES
  FROM THE PROCEDURE LIBRARY SET SPECIFIED BY THE /*JOBPARM P(ROCLIB)=
  PARAMETER OR THE DEFAULT JES2 PROCEDURE LIBRARIES.

  IF SPECIFIED, THE DASD VOLUME CONTAINING THE SPECIFIED DATASET
  MUST BE ONLINE TO ALL SYSTEMS WHEN THE JOB IS CONVERTED.

)X PROCLIB CONTROL CARD:

  //*PROCLIB LIBRARY.NAME <,VOL=VOLSER>

  THIS CARD MUST APPEAR *BEFORE* ANY INSTREAM CATALOGUED PROCEDURES
  AND *BEFORE* THE FIRST EXEC PROC STATEMENT.

  LIBRARY.NAME  IS THE FULLY-QUALIFIED NAME OF THE PARTITIONED DATASET
                TO BE USED AS THE PROCEDURE LIBRARY FOR THE JOB.

  ,VOL=VOLSER   IF THE DATASET IS NOT CATALOGUED, SPECIFIES THE
                ONLINE DASD VOLUME CONTAINING THE DATASET.

)O SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR USING PRIVATE PROCLIBS:

))TYPRUN=JCLHOLD  IF THE DASD VOLUME CONTAINING THE SPECIFIED LIBRARY
                  IS **NOT** ONLINE (OR IF THE JOB IS TO BE READ IN
                  BEFORE IT CAN BE MOUNTED), SPECIFY TYPRUN=JCLHOLD
                  ON THE JOB CARD AND INCLUDE A /*SETUP CARD FOR THE
                  DASD VOLUME INSTRUCTING THE OPERATOR TO RELEASE THE
                  JOB WHEN THE VOLUME IS MOUNTED.  EXAMPLE:

                  //JOBNAME JOB ACCT-INFO,PGMRNAME,...TYPRUN=JCLHOLD
                  /*SETUP DENVER DASD VOLUME; ONLY THEN RELEASE JOB

                  IF THE VOLUME CONTAINING THE LIBRARY IS NOT ONLINE
                  WHEN THE JOB IS CONVERTED (TO THE SYSTEM DOING THE
                  CONVERSION) THE JOB WILL JCL-FLUSH.

))ENQUEUED        IF THE DATASET SPECIFIED AS A PRIVATE PROCLIB IS     1
                  ENQUEUED EXCLUSIVELY FOR ANOTHER JOB OR A TSO USER,
                  THE JOB WILL BE RE-QUEUED FOR CONVERSION AND MARKED
                  AS JCLHOLD BY JES2; AN OPERATOR MESSAGE WILL BE
                  ISSUED.  THE OPERATOR SHOULD RELEASE THE JOB AS
                  SOON AS THE LIBRARY IS FREED UP.

))MESSAGES        ALLOCATION/DISPOSITION MESSAGES FOR THE PRIVATE
                  PROCEDURE LIBRARY (AND THE CATALOG ACCESSED, IF
                  APPROPRIATE, WILL APPEAR ON THE JES2 JOB LOG FOR
                  THE JOB PRIOR TO THE $HASP373 JOBNAME STARTED
                  MESSAGE.  THIS WILL OCCUR WHETHER ANY PROCEDURES
                  ARE ACTUALLY FETCHED FROM THE PRIVATE PROCLIB.
                  (MOST SYSTEM PROCS ARE IDENTIFIED AS TO WHAT
                  LIBRARY THEY RESIDE IN FOR THIS KIND OF REASON.)
