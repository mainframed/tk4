DOCUMENTATION FOR EXPORT.SOURCE:                     JUNE 1, 1980



THIS PARTITIONED DATASET (EXPORT.SOURCE) CONTAINS A SERIES OF JES2
MODIFICATIONS, PLUS SELECTED SUPPORT PROGRAMS:


THE JES2 MODIFICATIONS ARE PACKAGED AS IEBUPDTE SYSIN STREAMS.  INSTEAD
OF MODIFYING THE JES2 SOURCE DIRECTLY, MINIMAL CHANGES ARE MADE TO THE
SOURCE TO DELETE LINES OF CODE (WHERE NECESSARY) VIA AGO AND ANOP
INSTRUCTIONS, AND TO INSERT MACRO CALLS.  THE BULK OF EACH MODIFICATION
IS CONTAINED IN THE MACRO INSTRUCTION, WHICH IS ADDED TO THE IEBUPDTE
TARGET (SYSUT2) DATASET, AND WHICH IS INVOKED BY THE MACRO CALLS WITH
TRIGGERS TO ASSEMBLE THE APPROPRIATE MODIFICATION CODE.

WHERE MODIFICATIONS AFFECT JES2 CONTROL BLOCKS (AND MULTIPLE MODS
MAY DO SO, SUCH AS THE JCT) A NAMING CONVENTION IS USED TO INSERT THE
MACRO CALL IN THE MAPPING MACRO TO ALLOW FOR MULTIPLE INSERTIONS
WITHOUT HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT OTHER MACROS.

---> EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY NOTED BELOW, THE MODIFICATIONS ARE
---> INDEPENDENT OF EACH OTHER AND OF EXTERNAL CONSIDERATIONS.
---> THE PACKAGING TECHNIQUE SHOULD ALLOW ANY OR ALL MODIFICATIONS
---> TO BE PUT ON JES2 WITH A MINIMUM OF CONCERN.

---> THESE MODIFICATIONS ARE FOR JES2 VERSION 4.1, S.U. 825,
---> AND HAVE BEEN APPLIED AND TESTED TO AN MSE/IPO 4.0 SYSTEM
---> (MVS 3.8B BASE) WITH MVS/SE-II, SAM-E, RMF-II ON IT.  THE
---> SYSTEM IS AT SERVICE LEVEL 8001 AND JES2 IS ALSO AT SERVICE
---> LEVEL 8001, INCLUDING AZ27300 (CKPT DUPLEXING).



                    TABLE OF CONTENTS


$$DOC    - YOU ARE READING IT


$FCB     - MACRO TO GENERATE FCB IMAGES, FROM CBT MODS TAPE.  USED
           IN CONJUNCTION WITH JES2 MOD JE00001, AND WITH MEMBERS
           FCBUILD, FCBDOCUM, FCBSNOOP.


EXPORT   - THE JCL THAT BUILT THE EXPORT TAPE CONTAINING THIS PDS.


FCBDOCUM - DOCUMENTATION ABOUT THE $FCB MACRO AND HOW TO USE IT,
           FROM THE CBT MODS TAPE.


FCBSNOOP - A PROGRAM TO READ SYS1.IMAGELIB AND GENERATE $FCB MACRO
           CALLS FROM THE FCB IMAGES FOUND THEREIN.


FCBUILD  - A JOB WHICH USES $FCB TO GENERATE THE TWO KAISER STANDARD
           FCB IMAGES, KHP6 AND KHP8.  NOTE THAT THESE TWO IMAGES
           ARE MARKED AS 'STANDARD' FCB IMAGES, *AND* THAT THEY
           IMPLEMENT THE CHANNEL 7/8 PUNCHES FOR UP AND DOWN PAGE
           SERRATION LINES REQUIRED BY JES2 MODIFICATION JE00001.

           DEPENDENCIES:  $FCB, JE00001.


IEECVXIT - THIS ROUTINE IS SUPPLIED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE VERSION
           OF IEFACTRT, AND IS AN EXTENSION OF THE IEECVXIT ROUTINE
           SUPPLIED BY IPO.  ITS PURPOSE IS TO FILTER OUT ROUTE CODE
           14 FROM ALL CONSOLES.  IEFACTRT THEN USES ROUTE CODE 14
           TO ISSUE STEP TERMINATION MESSAGES WHICH WILL PRINT ON
           THE JES2 JOB LOG ON THE FIRST PAGE OF OUTPUT WITHOUT
           COMING OUT ON THE OPERATOR CONSOLE.

           DEPENDENCIES:  IEFACTRT (WHICH USES IT)


IEFACTRT - THIS ROUTINE IS SUPPLIED BOTH BECAUSE IT PROVIDES
           EXCP INFORMATION IN THE SMBS, AND BECAUSE IT PERFORMS TWO
           FUNCTIONS FOR THE JES2 MODIFICATIONS:

           (A) IT MARKS THE SCT OF EACH STEP WHICH EXECUTES AND
               IS NOT FLUSHED BY PLACING A X'77' IN SCTNSMSG
               FOR MODIFICATION JE00006.
           (B) AT JOB TERMINATION IT RETURNS THE JOB CPU TIME IN
               JMRUCOM FOR MODIFICATION JE00011.

           NOTE THAT NEITHER MODIFICATION IS DEPENDENT UPON IEFACTRT'S
           PROVIDING THIS INFORMATION, BUT IF THE INFORMATION IS NOT
           PRESENT JE00006 MAY PRODUCE AN ERRONEOUS HIGH RC/CC VALUE,
           AND JE00011 WILL NOT PRODUCE ONE OF ITS PRPU MESSAGES ON
           THE JOB LOG.

           DEPENDENCIES:  JE00006, JE00011, IEECVXIT

JE00011 - KHPRDC TIME LIMIT AND TIME/REGION ESTIMATE MODIFICATIONS

          THIS MOD ACCOMPLISHES THE FOLLOWING:

         1) A 'FACTOR' JES2 INITIALIZATION CONTROL CARD IS DEFINED
            FOR HASPINIT TO GENERATE A NORMALIZATION FACTOR FOR
            JOB CPU TIME LIMIT FOR EACH SYSTEM IN THE COMPLEX.
            THE FORMAT OF THIS CARD IS:  FACTOR SYS=NNNN,FACTOR=NNN
            WHERE 'XXXX' IS THE SYSTEM ID AND 'NNN' IS THE CPU FACTOR
            (100 = 1 MIP; 86 WOULD BE .86 MIP (158-I); 110 WOULD BE
            1.1 MIP (3031); AND SO FORTH).  (FROM MOTOROLA WESTERN
            AREA COMPUTER CENTER MODIFICATION SMSP-52.)
         2) IF TIME= SPECIFIED ON JOB CARD, IT ALSO BECOMES THE
            JOBPARM ESTIMATED CPU TIME.
         3) IF TIME= SPECIFIED ON JOBPARM CARD, IT ALSO BECOMES THE
            JOB MAXIMUM TIME.
         4) IF BOTH ARE SPECIFIED, THE JOBPARM CARD TAKES PRIORITY.
         5) IF NEITHER ARE SPECIFIED, THE JOB CLASS DEFAULT FROM THE
            CONVERTER PARM FIELD BECOMES ESTIMATED CPU TIME.
         6) IF THE JOB/JOBPARM TIME IS > THAN CLASS LIMIT, THE
            CLASS LIMIT WILL APPLY AT **EXECUTION** TIME, BUT THE
            LARGER TIME WILL APPLY AT EXECUTION PRIORITIZATION.
         7) IF A REGION SIZE IS SPECIFIED ON THE JOB CARD, IT WILL
            BE USED IN THE EXECUTION PRIORITIZATION.
         8) IF NO REGION SIZE APPEARS ON THE JOB CARD, THE JOB
            CLASS CONVERTER PARM DEFAULT REGION WILL BE USED FOR
            EXECUTION PRIORITIZATION.
         9) THE MESSAGES ON THE JES2 JOB LOG ARE CHANGED TO (A)
            PRINT 'ELAPSED EXEC TIME' RATHER THAN 'EXECUTION TIME'
            (SINCE THAT IS WHAT IT REALLY IS ANYHOW); PRINT THE
            JOB TIME LIMIT AS FACTORED; PRINT THE JOB CPU TIME AS
            REFACTORED BACK TO 1 MIP; PRINT THE FACTOR USED AND
            THE SYSTEM ID OF THE EXECUTION PROCESSOR.
        10) THE FACTOR USED IS PLACED IN THE SMF TYPE 26 (JOB PURGE)
            RECORD AS A FULLWORD BINARY NUMBER, REPLACING SMF26RSV,
            A RESERVED FIELD.
        11) ***NOTE*** THIS MODIFICATION CHANGES THE MEANING OF
            THE JCTETIME PARAMETER.  &TIMEOPT=NO SHOULD BE SPECIFIED
            TO AVOID "EXECUTION TIMING" BY JES2 SINCE THIS MOD WILL
            TAKE THE PLACE OF THAT FACILITY AND USE THE OS TIME
            EXCESSION MECHANISMS.
        12) ***NOTE*** THIS MODIFICATION REQUIRES IEFACTRT TO PLACE
            THE JOB CPU TIME AT JOB END INTO JMRUCOM AND SET THE
            HIGH-ORDER BYTE TO X'77' OR THE CPU TIME LINE WILL NOT
            BE PRODUCED (MERELY THE TIME LIMIT LINE.)  A VERSION OF
            IEFACTRT WHICH DOES THIS IS INCLUDED IN THIS PDS.

          THIS MODIFICATION WAS TAILORED FROM THE SHARE JES MODS
          TAPE VERSION 12.  MODIFICATIONS PARTICIPATING IN THIS MOD
          WERE AEP-46, SMSP-52, AND CSG-1Z.

FOR 158-1 RATHER THAN THE DEFAULT OF 158-3.

(KAISER HAS GONE TO SE-II AND NO LONGER USES THE FENCING MODIFICATION,
BUT ENOUGH PEOPLE ARE STILL INTERESTED THAT I KEEP IT ON THE EXPORT
DATASET.)

THE FOLLOWING WAS ADDED IN AT CBT TO PICK UP ADDITIONAL PGMS
THAT WERE SHIPPED FROM KAISER PREVIOUSLY

$SMFBRWS IS A MODIFIED VERSION OF THE SMF BROWSE PROGRAM ON THE CBT
MODS TAPE AND CAN BE DRIVEN BY THE 'SMF' CLIST PROVIDED IN THE CLIST
EXPORT PDS.  NOTE THAT 'SMF' IN THIS PDS IS THE HELP MEMBER.

ILRBIRD WAS FOUND ON A TAPE FROM AN UNNAMED VENDOR'S EDUCATION CENTER
IN THE MIDWEST.  I SUGGEST YOU COMPILE AND LINK IT INTO A TSO COMMAND
LIBRARY AND TRY IT.  GIVE IT THE ALIAS 'BIRD' WHICH IS MORE INDICITIVE
ANYHOW.  WE USE IT AS AN ULTIMATE USER ERROR MESSGE.  NOTE THAT THIS
DOES *NOT* WORK WELL ON DIAL LINES -- IT IS FOR FULL SCREEN SUPPORT.
(KIDDING ASIDE, IT GIVES YOU AN INSTANTANEOUS AND VERY GOOD SUBJECTIVE
IDEA OF YOUR CURRENT VARIATION IN RESPONSE TIME.)
