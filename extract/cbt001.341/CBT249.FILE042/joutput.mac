)F KHPRDC JES2 OUTPUT CARD FORMAT AND CONVENTIONS

  THE /*OUTPUT CARD SPECIFIES CHARACTERISTICS AND/OR OPTIONS OF A
  SPECIFIC SYSOUT DATASET OR GROUP OF SYSOUT DATASETS; OF THE JOB
  STANDARD OUTPUT; OR OF THE JOB'S JES2 JOBLOG, JCL, AND SYSTEM
  MESSAGES ONLY.  WHEN SPECIFIED, THE PARAMETERS ON THE /*OUTPUT
  CONTROL CARD OVERRIDE THE EQUIVALENT PARAMETERS FOR ***ALL OUTPUT***
  WHOSE FORMS TYPE IS EQUAL TO THE OUTPUT CONTROL CARD FORMS TYPE
  ***REGARDLESS*** OF THE SYSOUT CLASS OF THE OUTPUT.

  THE /*OUTPUT CONTROL CARD IS OPTIONAL AND NEED BE SPECIFIED ONLY IF
  SYSOUT/JOB OUTPUT DEFAULTS OR SPECIFICATIONS ARE TO BE OVERRIDEN AS
  A GROUP BY FORMS TYPE.

  THE /*OUTPUT CARD IS BASICALLY THE SAME AS THE VANILLA JES2 OUTPUT
  CARD DOCUMENTED IN THE MVS JCL MANUAL, IBM ORDER NUMBER GC28-0692.

)X SYNTAX OF OUTPUT CARD:

   /*OUTPUT CODE KEYWORD=VALUE <,KEYWORD=VALUE> <,KEYWORD=VALUE>

   REQUIRED -  COLUMN 1-8    '/*OUTPUT'
               COLUMN 9      ONE BLANK
               COLUMN 10-13  'CODE' OR '*   '
               COLUMN 14     AT LEAST ONE BLANK
               COLUMN 15-71  KEYWORD=VALUE <,KEYWORD=VALUE> <,....>

   GENERAL  -  COLUMNS 72-80 WILL BE IGNORED.

               THE OUTPUT STATEMENT MAY BE CONTINUED BY SPECIFYING
               'CODE' AS A '*' INDICATING CONTINUATION OF THE PREVIOUS
               /*OUTPUT STATEMENT.

               ALL PARAMETERS HAVE SHORT FORMS. EITHER THE ABBREVIATION
               OR THE SPELLED-OUT FORM OF THE KEYWORD MAY BE USED.

               PARAMETERS SPECIFIED ON THE /*OUTPUT CARD WILL REPLACE
               ANY EQUIVALENT PAREMETERS SPECIFIED ON THE REFERENCED
               DD STATEMENT(S) OR DEFAULTS FOR THE JOB FORMS OR 'JCL'.

               MULTIPLE OUTPUT STATEMENTS MAY BE INCLUDED IN A JOB.
               IF MORE THAN ONE OUTPUT STATEMENT IS INCLUDED FOR THE
               SAME FORMS TYPE ('CODE' IN COLUMNS 10-13), THE FIRST
               OUTPUT STATEMENT'S PARAMETERS WILL BE USED.

               IF A PARAMETER IS MULTIPLY SPECIFIED ON THE SAME
               /*OUTPUT CARD, THE LAST-ENCOUNTERED PARAMETER VALUE
               WILL BE USED.

               AS WITH ALL JES2 CONTROL STATEMENTS, THE /*OUTPUT CARD
               ***MAY NOT*** BE INCLUDED IN A CATALOGUED PROCEDURE.

               POSITION IS OFFSET TO THE RIGHT BY THE NUMBER SPECIFIED,
               CAUSING THE TOTAL PRINT WIDTH TO BE REDUCED BY THE

               BEFORE JES2 ISSUES ITS OWN SKIP TO NEW PAGE.

               NOTES:  '0' MEANS JES2 NEVER SKIPS AND MUST BE USED
                       IF OUTPUT HAS NO SKIP-TO-ONES IN IT (LIKE

  L=NNNN       WILL GENERATE TO PRINT -- IN THOUSANDS OF LINES
               (1 = 1000; 12 = 12000, ABOUT 200 PAGES).  IF THE JOB
               EXCEEDS 'NNNN' THOUSAND LINES IT WILL BE TERMINATED.
               THIS VALUE IS USED IN GENERATING SELECTION PRIORITY
               FOR EXECUTION: THE LOWER THE ESTIMATE, THE HIGHER THE
