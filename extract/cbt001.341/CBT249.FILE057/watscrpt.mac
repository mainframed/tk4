PANSPOOL INTERCEPTS THE SYSMSG OUTPUT OF JOBS WITH A SPECIFIC
"MSGCLASS" (MSGCLASS = W) AND INTERACTS WITH PANVALET IN ORDER TO
CREATE PAN DATA SETS ON A PERMANENT DISK LIBRARY (PROD.PANSPOOL).
EACH JOB IS ENTERED AS A NEW PAN DATA SET WHOSE MODULE NAME IS A
FUNCTION OF THE JOBNAME AND JES2 JOBNUMBER.  THE SYSMSG OUTPUT OF THE
JOB IS THEN DELETED FROM THE JES2 PRINT QUEUE.
.para
WHILE SYSMSG OUTPUT IS BEING TRANSFERRED TO PANVALET, IT IS SCANNED FOR
ANY OCCURRENCES OF INSTALLATION-DEFINED ERROR MESSAGES.  IF ONE OF THESE
MESSAGES IS DETECTED, THE JOB IS 'RE-QUEUED' FOR PRINTING (IN A CLASS
OTHER THAN 'W' - MEMOREX:  CLASS=A) IN ADDITION TO BEING STORED ON THE
PANVALET LIBRARY.  THE PRESENCE OF PRINTED COPY INDICATES JOB FAILURE.
.para
A DAILY JOB, JCLDAILY, IS RUN IN ORDER TO ARCHIVE THREE DAY OLD DATA
SETS FROM PROD.PANSPOOL TO TAPE.  A NEW TAPE (GENERATION) IS CREATED ON
A DAILY BASIS FOR A PERIOD OF ONE MONTH (31 DAYS) WITH A RETENTION
PERIOD OF 45 DAYS TO ALLOW FOR OVERLAP (EG. MONTH/YEAR-END CLOSE).  EACH
DAILY GENERATION MAKES USE OF THE PANVALET HISTORICAL MERGE DELETE
FACILITY.  THE MONTH-END JOB, JCLMTHLY, SUBSEQUENTLY CREATES AN
ADDITIONAL GENERATION WITH A TWO-YEAR RETENTION PERIOD.
.para
JOBS ARE RETRIEVED TO PROD.PANSPOOL BY USING AN INTERACTIVE TSO
COMMAND LANGUAGE PROCEDURE (CLIST) WHICH PROVIDES THE USER WITH
SEVERAL OPTIONS INCLUDING SELECTIVE DISPLAY (BY JOBNAME) OF THE
CONTENTS OF PROD.PANSPOOL, A LISTING OF A GIVEN JOB ON THE CRT AND/OR
PRINTER, AND SUBMISSION OF A JOB FOR RETRIEVAL OF A PREVIOUSLY ARCHIVED
JOB FROM TAPE FOR EXAMINATION.
.section 'PANSPOOL:  FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION'
.para
PANSPOOL OPERATES AS A JES2 EXTERNAL WRITER (CONSOLE STARTED TASK) AND
MAY BE OPTIONALLY INITIALIZED USING THE JES2 INITIALIZATION PARAMETERS
DATA SET OR VIA A "SOF" SUBSYSTEM INTERFACE COMMAND ("MVS SECONDARY
OPERATOR FACILITY", IBM FDP/5798-CRE - SB21-2180).  THE LOAD MODULE
CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING:
.point begin
THE JES2 EXTERNAL WRITER AND MAIN DRIVER, JCLLIST,
.point
PANEXIT, AN ENTRY POINT IN JCLLIST,
.point
THE PAN#1 PROGRAM, WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH PANEXIT AS A STANDARD
FEATURE OF ITS OPERATION (NORMALLY PANEXIT IS A DUMMY CSECT).
.point end
.para
WHEN PANSPOOL IS STARTED, THE DRIVER, JCLLIST, ISSUES AN "IEFSSREQ"
MACRO INSTRUCTION REQUESTING A SYSOUT CLASS 'W' DATA SET FROM JES2.
IF NONE IS AVAILABLE, THE DRIVER WAITS UNTIL IT IS STOPPED (BY AN
OPERATOR COMMAND) OR UNTIL IT IS POSTED BY JES2.  IN THE LATTER CASE,
IT RE-ISSUES THE IEFSSREQ MACRO INSTRUCTION.
.para
IF A CLASS 'W' DATA SET IS AVAILABLE, THE DRIVER CALLS PAN#1 (ENTRY
POINT= FGPAN1) WHICH IN TURN CALLS PANEXIT.  THIS PROVIDES PAN#1 WITH
INPUT (BY USE OF PARAMETERS), AND ALSO EXAMINES PRINT, PUNCH, AND WORK
OUTPUT OF PAN#1 BEFORE IT IS ACTUALLY WRITTEN.
.para
WHEN PANEXIT IS FIRST ENTERED FOR INPUT, IT DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATES AND
OPENS THE SYSOUT 'W' DATA SET PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED BY JES2.  AFTER
PASSING APPROPRIDATE ("++ADD") CONTROL STATEMENTS TO PAN#1, IT READS
THE DATA SET AND PASSES INDIVIDUAL LINES WHICH ARE THEN WRITTEN TO THE
PANVALET LIBRARY.  SINCE EACH JOB NORMALLY CONSISTS OF THREE DATA SETS
(JES2 LOG, JCL, MESSAGES), "++UPDATE" CARDS MUST BE PASSED TO PAN#1
BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL DATA SETS OF THE SAME JOB.  EACH DATA SET IS
DELETED FROM THE JES2 SPOOL AFTER IT IS PROCESSED.
.section 'NAMING CONVENTIONS OF MODULES PLACED ON THE PANVALET SPOOL'
.para
SINCE THE NAMES OF PANVALET MODULES MAY CONSIST OF UP TO 10 ALPHABETIC

OTHER INSTALLATION-DEFINED MESSAGES.  A FLAG IS SET IF ONE OF THESE
MESSAGES IS FOUND.  IF AN ERROR CONDITION IS DETECTED, PANEXIT
DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATES A NEW SYSOUT DATA SET BEFORE THE LAST DATA SET
OF THE JOB IS DELETED.  AT THE END OF THE JOB THE SYSOUT DATA SET IS
CLOSED AND FREED.  THUS THE SYSOUT DATA SET IS IMMEDIATELY QUEUED FOR
PRINTING AND INSPECTION BY PRODUCTION CONTROL PERSONNEL.
.para
AFTER A JOB IS PROCESSED AND ITS LAST DATA SET IS DELETED, PANEXIT
ISSUES AN IEFSSREQ MACRO INSTRUCTION.  IF A SYSOUT CLASS 'W' DATA SET
IS AVAILABLE IT IS PROCESSED BY PASSING A NEW "++ADD" CARD TO PAN#1;
OTHERWISE, AN END-OF-FILE IS PASSED.  PAN#1 THEN TERMINATES AND
RETURNS TO THE DRIVER (JCLLIST) WHICH AGAIN WAITS UNTIL IT IS EITHER
TERMINATED OR POSTED.

ROUTINE, AND TERMINATES WITH A MESSAGE TO THE OPERATOR.
.SECTION 'RECOVERY AND RESTART CAPABILITIES'

PANSPOOL WAS DESIGNED WITH TOTAL RECOVERY CAPABILITIES.  IT MAY BE
RESTARTED BY THE OPERATOR IF FAILURE IS DUE TO AN EXTERNAL PROBLEM,
INCLUDING OPERATING SYSTEM FAILURE.  IF PANSPOOL FAILS AND CANNOT BE
RESTARTED BECAUSE OF UNFORESEEN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE SYSOUT 'W' DATA SETS
WILL BE AVAILABLE TO THE USER BY ISSUEING A JES2 OPERATOR COMMAND TO SET
THE PRINTER(S) TO PROCESS CLASS 'W' OUTPUT.  AN OS 'START' COMMAND IS
ALL THAT IS REQUIRED TO REINSTATE PANSPOOL PROCESSING; FURTHERMORE,
OPERATIONS PERSONNEL MAY OPTIONALLY ISSUE A MVS SECONDARY OPERATOR

JCLPRINT IS AN INTERACTIVE TSO COMMAND LANGUAGE PROCEDURE (CLIST) USED
TO ACCESS SYSMSG OUTPUT (JES2 JOB LOG, JCL, EXECUTION MESSAGES)
PREVIOUSLY PROCESSED BY PANSPOOL.  IT WAS DESIGNED WITH THE OBJECTIVE
OF PROVIDING A USER-ORIENTED, NON-TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION INTERFACE
WITH THE USER.  A JOB MAY BE RETRIEVED BY KNOWING LITTLE BEYOND ITS
NAME, NUMBER, AND DATE/TIME OF EXECUTION.
.para
UPON EXECUTION OF THE CLIST, THE USER IS PRESENTED WITH CONCISE
QUESTIONS CONCERNING HIS REQUIREMENTS.  A REPONSE OF "?" (QUESTION
MARK) IN MOST INSTANCES WILL PROVIDE A MORE DETAILED EXPLANATION OF
THE QUESTION AND APPROPRIATE RESPONSES.

THE FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF JCLPRINT OPTIONS (I.E.:  TYPES OF INPUT THE
USER MUST ENTER) AND A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SEQUENCE OF EVENTS
THAT RESULTS FOR EACH TYPE OF RESPONSE:
.sk
.point begin
JOBNAME - ENTERED AS A STRING OF 8 OR LESS CHARACTERS;
IF THE NAME OF THE REQUIRED JOB IS ENTERED, JCLPRINT WILL LIST ALL OF
THE ENTRIES FOR THAT JOBNAME PRESENT ON PROD.PANSPOOL.  THE USER MAY
DETERMINE WHICH ENTRY CORRESPONDS TO THE PARTICULAR RUN OF THE JOB HE
NEEDS BY EXAMINING THE DATE AND TIME INFORMATION PROVIDED AND NOTING THE
CORRESPONDING JOB NUMBER.  SUBSEQUENTLY, JCLPRINT WILL REQUEST THE USER
FOR THAT JOB NUMBER SO THAT IT MAY, IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE JOBNAME,
DERIVE THE PANNAME FOR THE REQUESTED JOB.  JCLPRINT THEN PROCEEDS TO
RETRIEVE THE PANVALET DATA SET (PANNAME) AND ASKS THE USER WHETHER HE
WANTS A HARD COPY LISTING.  A REPLY OF "YES" INVOKES THE DYNAMIC
ALLOCATION OF A SYSOUT DATA SET IN WHICH THE CONTENTS OF THE RETRIEVED
PANVALET DATA SET ARE WRITTEN.  THE SYSOUT DATA SET IS THEN FREED AND
QUEUED FOR PRINTING.  A REPLY OF "NO" LISTS THE RETRIEVED DATA SET ON
THE CRT AND THE USER IS GIVEN ANOTHER CHANCE TO REQUEST A HARD COPY
LISTING.  THE "TEMPORARY" DATA SET CREATED BY THE RETRIEVE PROCESS IS
THEN DELETED AND THE USER IS PROMPTED FOR THE NEXT REQUEST.
.point
PANNAME - ENTERED AS A STRING OF 10 CHARACTERS;
THE USER WOULD ENTER A PANNAME IF HE ALREADY KNOWS THE JOB HE REQUIRES
(EG.:  BY LOOKING AT 'JCLDAILY' OUTPUT).  IN THIS CASE JCLPRINT SKIPS
THE LISTING OF PROD.PANSPOOL ENTRIES FOR THE JOB AND GOES DIRECTLY TO
THE RETRIEVAL PROCESS.  FROM THERE, IT CONTINUES AS IF A JOBNAME HAD
BEEN SPECIFIED.

A VOLUME SERIAL NUMBER IS ENTERED FOR THE PURPOSES OF RETRIEVING ONE OR

ARCHIVAL UTILITY, 'JCLARCH', INVOKES THE PAN#2 PROGRAM WHICH REMOVES
FROM PROD.PANSPOOL ANY PANVALET DATA SETS OLDER THAN 72 HOURS, MERGES
THEM WITH THE PREVIOUS DAY'S TAPE, AND PRODUCES A NEW OUTPUT TAPE WHOSE
SECOND FILE (DSN = PANSPOOL.ARCHIVE.GXXXXV00) CONTAINS ALL OF THE JOBS
ARCHIVED FROM PROD.PANSPOOL DURING THE CURRENT WEEK.  THE FIRST FILE OF
THE TAPE (DSN = PSPLVTOC) CONTAINS A DIRECTORY OF THE CONTENTS OF THE
SECOND FILE.  A LISTING OF THIS DIRECTORY IS PRODUCED DURING EACH RUN OF
JCLDAILY, AND IT MAY BE USED FOR DETERMINING THE PANNAME CORRESPONDING
TO ANY GIVEN JOB IN THE EVENT THAT A RETRIEVAL FROM TAPE (USING OPTION

HAVE ALREADY BEEN EXAMINED AND SUBSEQUENTLY FLAGGED AS 'DISABLED' BY
RESTART PERSONNEL USING THE JCLPRINT CLIST.  PRODUCTION CONTROL
PERSONNEL RESPONSIBLE FOR COORDINATION AND EXAMINATION OF THE ARCHIVAL
RUNS AND RETRIEVALS SHOULD BE AWARE THAT A POTENTIAL OUT-OF-SPACE
CONDITION MAY ARISE IF NUMEROUS MODULES ARE RESTORED TO PROD.TAPELIST
(AND PERHAPS ONLY BROWSED) AND NOT PRINTED ON HARDCOPY.  THE JCLPRINT
CLIST ONLY FLAGS MODULES AS DISABLED (I.E. CHANGES THEIR STATUS) AFTER
THEY HAVE BEEN PRINTED ON HARDCOPY.  OCCASSIONAL PAN#2 DIRECTORY
LISTINGS OF PROD.TAPELIST ARE ENCOURAGED TO PRECLUDE THE POSSIBILITY OF
HAVING A PROLIFERATION OF OUT-DATED, RESTORED MODULES RESIDING ON THE

NOTE THAT THE PANSPOOL TASK WILL REMAIN IN AN 'OUTPUT LONG-WAIT'; IT
WILL ISSUE AN STIMER EVERY THIRTY SECONDS TO CHECK FOR THE PRESENCE OF
ANY SYSOUT=W OUTPUT.  INSTALLATIONS USING THE UICC 'JTIP' PRODUCT
(JES2/TSO INTERFACE PACKAGE) WILL HAVE TO RELEASE JOBS FROM THE FETCH
QUEUE BEFORE THEY CAN BE INTERCEPTED BY JCLLIST.  IN ADDITION, UP TO
EIGHT SYSOUT CLASSES MAY BE SIMULTANEOUSLY INTERCEPTED BY CHANGING THE
'DC' AFTER LABEL 'SSFUNC' IN MODULE 'JCLLIST'; LIKEWISE, THE RE-QUEUE
CLASS MAY BE MODIFIED TO INSTALLATION STANDARDS BY CHANGING THE 'DC'
AFTER LABEL 'PRSYSOUT' AS WELL.
