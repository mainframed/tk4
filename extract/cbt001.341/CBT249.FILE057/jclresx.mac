//*   JCLRESTR JOB EXECUTION GUIDELINES:
//*   ----------------------------------
//*
//*      1.  THIS JOB IS USED TO COPY A MEMBER FROM A PANSPOOL ARCHIVAL
//*          TAPE (INDEX=PANSPOOL.ARCHIVE) TO PROD.TAPELIST; THE JOB
//*          IS SUBMITTED BY THE JCLPRINT TSO CLIST
//*      2.  NOTE THAT BLP PROCESSING MUST BE SPECIFIED AND EXPDT=98000
//*          MUST BE CODED IN A UCC1/TMS INSTALLATION TO AVOID S1F4-0A
//*          ABENDS DUE TO A NON-MATCH OF THE DATASET NAME SPECIFIED IN
//*          THE JCL WITH THAT NAME CONTAINED IN THE UCC1 TMC
//*      3.  CHANGED THE JOB NAME TO THE CONTROL VARIABLE '&SYSUID' IN
//*          ORDER THAT THE JOB NAME WILL BE DISPLAYED AS THE USERID OF
//*          SUBMITTING TSO USER; AS A CONSEQUENCE, THE SUBMITTING TSO
//*          USER WILL BE PROMPTED TO SUPPLY 'USERID PLUS ONE CHARAC-
//*          TER(S)' DURING SUBMIT PROCESSING
//*      4.  CHANGED THE JCL TO USE THE CURRENT GENERATION OF THE
//*          ARCHIVE TAPE; THIS WILL ALLOW FOR RESTORES WITHOUT THE
//*          NECESSITY OF SPECIFYING THE VOLUME SERIAL NUMBER OF THE
//*          ARCHIVE TAPE
//*      5.  CHANGED THE JOB NAME TO A SYSID NAME FOR THE USER SUPPORT
//*          WITHIN THE DATA CENTER TO PERMIT TRACKING OF SUBMITTED
//*          PANSPOOL RESTORES
//*      6.  CHANGED THE MSGCLASS PARAMETER ON THE JOB CARD TO 'S' TO
//*          SUPPRESS PRINTING OF BOTH THE JCL LISTING AND MESSAGES
//*          FOR THIS JOB
