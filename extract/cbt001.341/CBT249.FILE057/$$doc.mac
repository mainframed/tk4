           SYSTEMS IN  MONTREAL DEVELOPED A ROUTINE  USING PANVALET/TSO
           TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM.
0             THE ROUTINE,  KNOWN  AS JCLLIST AND REGISTERED  AS NUMBER
           P.10.0-1082 ON THE SYSTEMS EXCHANGE, IS A JES2 EXTERNAL WRI-
           TER THAT INTERCEPTS  ALL PRODUCTION JCL LISTINGS  AND ROUTES
           THEM TO A PANVALET LIBRARY.    THE LISTINGS ARE KEPT ON-LINE
           FOR 48 HOURS, THEN ARCHIVED TO TAPE FOR AN ADDITIONAL 30-DAY
           RETENTION PERIOD.
0             'FAILED' JOBS ARE IDENTIFIED BY JCLLIST AND AUTOMATICALLY
           ROUTED FOR IMMEDIATE  PRINTING,  AS WELL AS  TO THE PANVALET
           LIBRARY.  THIS PROCEDURE ELIMINATES ALMOST ENTIRELY THE POS-
           SIBILITY THAT  "FAILED" JOBS MIGHT  GO UNDETECTED  BY OPERA-
           TIONS PERSONNEL.
0             ON-LINE LISTINGS  CAN BE  DISPLAYED OR  PRINTED VIA  PAN-
           VALET/TSO.   AN 'PANPRINT' INTERACTIVE  CLIST,  GIVES OPERA-
           TIONS PERSONNEL A SET OF SIMPLE,  LOGICAL,  COMMANDS FOR RE-
           VIEWING AND PRINTING JCLLIST  LISTINGS.   AUXILIARY COMMANDS
           PROVIDE EQUALLY  SIMPLE FACILITIES  FOR RETRIEVAL  OF PREVI-

           ICAL AGE GREATER THAN 72 HOURS  WILL BE ARCHIVED TO TAPE FOR
           A RETENTION PERIOD OF 45 DAYS.   IN THE CASE OF A PRODUCTION
           JOB WHICH MAY HAVE FAILED (EG.  JOB CANCELLATION, JCL ERROR,
           SYSTEM FAILURE, ETC.)  PANSPOOL WILL RE-QUEUE THOSE JOBS FOR

0             PANSPOOL INTERCEPTS THE SYSMSG OUTPUT OF JOBS WITH A SPE-
           CIFIC "MSGCLASS" (MSGCLASS = W)  AND INTERACTS WITH PANVALET
           IN ORDER TO CREATE PAN DATA SETS ON A PERMANENT DISK LIBRARY
           (PROD.PANSPOOL).   EACH JOB IS ENTERED AS A NEW PAN DATA SET
           WHOSE MODULE NAME IS A FUNCTION OF THE JOBNAME AND JES2 JOB-
           NUMBER.   THE SYSMSG OUTPUT OF THE  JOB IS THEN DELETED FROM
           THE JES2 PRINT QUEUE.
0             WHILE SYSMSG OUTPUT IS BEING TRANSFERRED TO PANVALET,  IT
           IS SCANNED FOR ANY OCCURRENCES OF INSTALLATION-DEFINED ERROR
           MESSAGES.   IF ONE OF THESE MESSAGES IS DETECTED, THE JOB IS
           'RE-QUEUED' FOR PRINTING (IN A CLASS  OTHER THAN 'W' - MEMO-
           REX:   CLASS=A)  IN ADDITION TO BEING STORED ON THE PANVALET
           LIBRARY.   THE PRESENCE  OF PRINTED COPY INDICATES  JOB FAI-
           LURE.
0             A DAILY JOB,  JCLDAILY,  IS RUN IN ORDER TO ARCHIVE THREE
           DAY OLD DATA  SETS FROM PROD.PANSPOOL TO TAPE.    A NEW TAPE
           (GENERATION) IS CREATED ON A DAILY BASIS FOR A PERIOD OF ONE
           MONTH (31 DAYS)  WITH A RETENTION PERIOD OF 45 DAYS TO ALLOW
           FOR OVERLAP (EG. MONTH/YEAR-END CLOSE).   EACH DAILY GENERA-
           TION MAKES USE  OF THE PANVALET HISTORICAL  MERGE DELETE FA-
           CILITY.   THE MONTH-END JOB, JCLMTHLY,  SUBSEQUENTLY CREATES
           AN ADDITIONAL GENERATION WITH A TWO-YEAR RETENTION PERIOD.
0             JOBS ARE RETRIEVED TO PROD.PANSPOOL  BY USING AN INTERAC-
           TIVE TSO COMMAND LANGUAGE  PROCEDURE (CLIST)  WHICH PROVIDES
           THE USER  WITH SEVERAL  OPTIONS INCLUDING  SELECTIVE DISPLAY
           (BY JOBNAME) OF THE CONTENTS OF PROD.PANSPOOL,  A LISTING OF
           A GIVEN JOB ON THE CRT  AND/OR PRINTER,  AND SUBMISSION OF A
           JOB FOR RETRIEVAL OF A PREVIOUSLY ARCHIVED JOB FROM TAPE FOR
           EXAMINATION.

           2.3   PANSPOOL:  FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
+                ________   __________ ___________
0             PANSPOOL  OPERATES AS  A  JES2  EXTERNAL WRITER  (CONSOLE
           STARTED TASK)  AND  MAY BE OPTIONALLY INITIALIZED  USING THE
           JES2 INITIALIZATION PARAMETERS DATA SET  OR VIA A "SOF" SUB-
           SYSTEM INTERFACE COMMAND ("MVS SECONDARY OPERATOR FACILITY",
           IBM FDP/5798-CRE - SB21-2180).   THE LOAD MODULE CONSISTS OF
           THE FOLLOWING:
0             ø THE JES2 EXTERNAL WRITER AND MAIN DRIVER, JCLLIST,
0             ø PANEXIT, AN ENTRY POINT IN JCLLIST,
0             ø THE PAN#1 PROGRAM,  WHICH  COMMUNICATES WITH PANEXIT
                AS A STANDARD FEATURE OF ITS OPERATION (NORMALLY PA-
                NEXIT IS A DUMMY CSECT).

              WHEN PANSPOOL IS STARTED, THE DRIVER, JCLLIST,  ISSUES AN
           "IEFSSREQ" MACRO  INSTRUCTION REQUESTING A SYSOUT  CLASS 'W'
           DATA SET FROM JES2.   IF NONE IS AVAILABLE, THE DRIVER WAITS
           UNTIL IT IS STOPPED (BY AN OPERATOR COMMAND)  OR UNTIL IT IS
           POSTED BY JES2.  IN THE LATTER CASE, IT RE-ISSUES THE IEFSS-
           REQ MACRO INSTRUCTION.
0             IF A CLASS  'W' DATA SET IS AVAILABLE,   THE DRIVER CALLS
           PAN#1 (ENTRY  POINT= FGPAN1)  WHICH  IN TURN  CALLS PANEXIT.
           THIS PROVIDES PAN#1 WITH INPUT  (BY USE OF PARAMETERS),  AND
           ALSO EXAMINES PRINT, PUNCH,  AND WORK OUTPUT OF PAN#1 BEFORE
           IT IS ACTUALLY WRITTEN.
0             WHEN PANEXIT IS FIRST ENTERED  FOR INPUT,  IT DYNAMICALLY
           ALLOCATES AND OPENS THE SYSOUT  'W' DATA SET PREVIOUSLY PRO-
           VIDED BY JES2.  AFTER PASSING APPROPRIDATE ("++ADD") CONTROL
           STATEMENTS TO PAN#1,  IT READS THE DATA SET AND PASSES INDI-
           VIDUAL LINES WHICH ARE THEN WRITTEN TO THE PANVALET LIBRARY.
           SINCE EACH  JOB NORMALLY CONSISTS  OF THREE DATA  SETS (JES2
           LOG,  JCL,  MESSAGES),   "++UPDATE" CARDS MUST BE  PASSED TO
           PAN#1 BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL  DATA SETS OF THE  SAME JOB.   EACH
           DATA SET  IS DELETED FROM  THE JES2  SPOOL AFTER IT  IS PRO-
           CESSED.

0                       PANSPOOL DETECTION OF JOB FAILURES
-             WHILE PANEXIT IS PASSING RECORDS TO PANVALET IT SCANS FOR
           ABNORMAL TERMINATION MESSAGES, BAD CONDITION CODES,  JCL ER-
           RORS,  AND CERTAIN OTHER  INSTALLATION-DEFINED MESSAGES.   A
           FLAG IS SET IF ONE OF THESE MESSAGES IS FOUND.   IF AN ERROR
           CONDITION IS DETECTED,  PANEXIT  DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATES A NEW
           SYSOUT DATA SET BEFORE  THE LAST DATA SET OF THE  JOB IS DE-
           LETED.   AT THE END OF THE JOB THE SYSOUT DATA SET IS CLOSED
           AND FREED.   THUS THE SYSOUT  DATA SET IS IMMEDIATELY QUEUED
           FOR PRINTING AND INSPECTION BY PRODUCTION CONTROL PERSONNEL.
0             AFTER A  JOB IS PROCESSED  AND ITS  LAST DATA SET  IS DE-
           LETED,  PANEXIT ISSUES AN IEFSSREQ MACRO INSTRUCTION.   IF A
           SYSOUT CLASS  'W' DATA SET IS  AVAILABLE IT IS  PROCESSED BY
           PASSING A NEW "++ADD" CARD TO PAN#1;  OTHERWISE,  AN END-OF-
           FILE IS PASSED.    PAN#1 THEN TERMINATES AND  RETURNS TO THE
           DRIVER (JCLLIST) WHICH AGAIN WAITS UNTIL IT IS EITHER TERMI-
           NATED OR POSTED.

0             JCLPRINT IS AN INTERACTIVE TSO COMMAND LANGUAGE PROCEDURE
           (CLIST) USED TO ACCESS SYSMSG OUTPUT (JES2 JOB LOG, JCL, EX-
           ECUTION MESSAGES) PREVIOUSLY PROCESSED BY PANSPOOL.   IT WAS
           DESIGNED WITH  THE OBJECTIVE  OF PROVIDING  A USER-ORIENTED,
           NON-TECHNICAL COMMUNICATION INTERFACE WITH THE USER.   A JOB
           MAY BE RETRIEVED BY KNOWING LITTLE BEYOND ITS NAME,  NUMBER,
           AND DATE/TIME OF EXECUTION.
0             UPON EXECUTION OF THE CLIST,   THE USER IS PRESENTED WITH
           CONCISE QUESTIONS CONCERNING HIS REQUIREMENTS.  A REPONSE OF
           "?" (QUESTION MARK)   IN MOST INSTANCES WILL  PROVIDE A MORE
           DETAILED EXPLANATION  OF THE  QUESTION AND  APPROPRIATE RES-
           PONSES.
0             THE FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF JCLPRINT OPTIONS (I.E.:  TYPES
           OF INPUT THE USER MUST ENTER) AND A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE
           SEQUENCE OF EVENTS THAT RESULTS FOR EACH TYPE OF RESPONSE:
-             ø JOBNAME - ENTERED  AS A STRING OF 8  OR LESS CHARAC-
                TERS;  IF THE  NAME OF THE REQUIRED  JOB IS ENTERED,
                JCLPRINT WILL LIST ALL OF  THE ENTRIES FOR THAT JOB-
                NAME PRESENT ON PROD.PANSPOOL.   THE USER MAY DETER-
                MINE WHICH  ENTRY CORRESPONDS TO THE  PARTICULAR RUN
                OF THE JOB  HE NEEDS BY EXAMINING THE  DATE AND TIME
                INFORMATION  PROVIDED AND  NOTING THE  CORRESPONDING
                JOB NUMBER.  SUBSEQUENTLY, JCLPRINT WILL REQUEST THE
                USER FOR THAT JOB NUMBER SO THAT IT MAY, IN CONJUNC-
                TION WITH THE  JOBNAME,  DERIVE THE PANNAME  FOR THE
                REQUESTED JOB.   JCLPRINT THEN  PROCEEDS TO RETRIEVE
                THE PANVALET DATA  SET (PANNAME)  AND ASKS  THE USER
