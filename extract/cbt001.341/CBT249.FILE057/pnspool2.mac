:h2.INTRODUCTION
.CE
- A GUIDE TO USING THE JES2 SYSMSG SPOOLING SYSTEM -
:p.
In an effort to alleviate the myriad of distribution problems involved
in collating, storing, and handling of the large volume of production
job control language listings generated daily by the MEMOREX/LSSG Data
Processing Services Center, Technical Support has implemented PANSPOOL,
an on-line spooling and retrieval system for use by operations
personnel.
:p.
All Job Control Language ('JCL') listings for production jobs specifying
MSGCLASS=W will be intercepted and saved in an on-line, PANVALET
LIBRARY, PROD.PANSPOOL, for a period of 72 hours.  On a daily basis
those listings with a chronological age greater than 72 hours will be
archived to tape for a retention period of 45 days.  In the case of a
production job which may have failed (e.g. job cancellation, JCL error,
system failure, etc.) PANSPOOL will re-queue those jobs for immediate
printing (SYSOUT=A) for subsequent inspection and analysis by operations
and/or restart personnel.
:p.
On-line listings can be displayed or printed using PANVALET or
PANVALET/TSO along with the JCLPRINT CLIST located in MRX.LIB.CLIST
by simply entering '%JCLPRINT' and entering any of a set of simple,
logical commands for reviewing, printing, or retrieving any needed
listings.  Further details regarding the operation and use (including
the HELP FACILITY) may be found in the section entitled "JCLPRINT -
TSO SYSMSG CLIST FACILITY".  Alternatively, older or less frequently
run production job listings may be retrieved to the retrieval PANVALET
LIBRARY, PROD.TAPELIST, for inspection as well.
:h2.PANSPOOL - THE JES2 SYSMSG SPOOLING SYSTEM
:h3.SYSTEM OBJECTIVES
:p.
PANSPOOL was specifically designed to address the problems encountered
by every large computing facility in printing, reviewing, and storing
large quantities of production, hard-copy JCL listings.
.ce
PRINCIPAL FEATURES:
:ol
:li
Eliminates the requirement of producing large volumes of JCL output on
paper,
:li
Identifies "failed" jobs by scanning production JCL for
installation-defined error conditions,
:li
Substantially reduces the probability that "failed" jobs will go
undetected by operations and/or restart personnel,
:li
Immediately queues "failed" jobs for printing and inspection by
operations and/or restart personnel,
:li
Maintains JCL listings for all production jobs on-line for 72 hours;
these listings can be examined using the PANVALET/TSO INTERFACE,
SPF/PANVALET INTERFACE, the 'JCLPRINT' CLIST, or the MEMOREX 'PANVIEW'
TSO DISPLAY UTILITY (P.9.0-665-1047, PANSOPHIC SYSTEMS EXCHANGE),
:li
Archives to tape all JCL listings with a chronological age greater
than 72 hours and produces an archive directory,
:li
Restores an archived listing to an on-line PANVALET LIBRARY for
inspection and action,
:li
Permits operations personnel to produce hardcopy from any on-line
JCL listing, and
:li
Automatically recovers (after operator restart) from normal operating
system failures.
:eol
:h3.PANSPOOL: GENERAL CONCEPTS AND FACILITIES
:p.
PANSPOOL intercepts the SYSMSG output of jobs with a specific
"MSGCLASS" (MSGCLASS = W) and interacts with PANVALET in order to
create PAN DATA SETS on a permanent disk library (PROD.PANSPOOL).
Each job is entered as a new PAN DATA SET whose module name is a
function of the jobname and JES2 jobnumber.  The SYSMSG output of the
job is then deleted from the JES2 print queue.
:p.
While SYSMSG output is being transferred to PANVALET, it is scanned for
any occurrences of installation-defined error messages.  If one of these
messages is detected, the job is 're-queued' for printing (in a class
other than 'W' - MEMOREX:  CLASS=A) in addition to being stored on the
PANVALET LIBRARY.  The presence of printed copy indicates job failure.
:p.
A daily job, JCLDAILY, is run in order to archive three day old data
sets from PROD.PANSPOOL to tape.  A new tape (generation) is created on
a daily basis for a period of one month (31 days) with a retention
period of 45 days to allow for overlap (e.g. month/year-end close). Each
daily generation makes use of the PANVALET HISTORICAL MERGE DELETE
FACILITY.  The month-end job, JCLMTHLY, subsequently creates an
additional generation with a two-year retention period.
:p.
Jobs are retrieved to PROD.PANSPOOL by using an interactive TSO
COMMAND LANGUAGE PROCEDURE (CLIST) which provides the user with
several options including selective display (by jobname) of the
contents of PROD.PANSPOOL, a listing of a given job on the CRT and/or
printer, and submission of a job for retrieval of a previously archived
job from tape for examination.
:H3.PANSPOOL:  FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION
:p.
PANSPOOL operates as a JES2 EXTERNAL WRITER (console started task) and
may be optionally initialized using the JES2 INITIALIZATION PARAMETERS
DATA SET or VIA a "SOF" SUBSYSTEM INTERFACE COMMAND ("MVS SECONDARY
OPERATOR FACILITY", IBM FDP/5798-CRE - SB21-2180).  The load module
consists of the following:
:ol
:li
The JES2 EXTERNAL WRITER and MAIN DRIVER, JCLLIST,
:li
PANEXIT, an ENTRY POINT in JCLLIST,
:li
The PAN#1 PROGRAM, which communicates with PANEXIT as a standard
feature of its operation (normally PANEXIT is a DUMMY CSECT).
:eol
:p.
When PANSPOOL is started, the DRIVER, JCLLIST, issues an "IEFSSREQ"
MACRO INSTRUCTION requesting a SYSOUT CLASS 'W' DATA SET from JES2.
If none is available, the DRIVER waits until it is stopped (by an
operator command) or until it is posted by JES2.  In the latter case,
it re-issues the IEFSSREQ MACRO INSTRUCTION.
:p.
If a CLASS 'W' DATA SET is available, the DRIVER calls PAN#1 (ENTRY
POINT= FGPAN1) which in turn calls PANEXIT.  This provides PAN#1 with
input (by use of parameters), and also examines print, punch, and work
output of PAN#1 before it is actually written.
:p.
When PANEXIT is first entered for input, it dynamically allocates and
opens the SYSOUT 'W' DATA SET previously provided by JES2.  After
passing appropriate ("++ADD") control statements to PAN#1, it reads
the data set and passes individual lines which are then written to the
PANVALET LIBRARY.  Since each job normally consists of three data sets
(JES2 LOG, JCL, MESSAGES), "++UPDATE" cards must be passed to PAN#1
between individual data sets of the same job.  Each data set is
deleted form the JES2 spool after it is processed.
:h3.NAMING CONVENTIONS OF MODULES PLACED ON THE PANVALET SPOOL
:p.
Since the names of PANVALET modules may consist of up to 10 alphabetic
(a-z) or numeric (0-9) characters, in any order or combination,
special considerations are used by JCLLIST to handle any jobs
beginning with national characters (#,@,$) and duplicate job names.

To insure unique PANVALET names, the job name is truncated to six
characters and the JES2 job number is appended to the remaining six
characters.

:h2.PANSPOOL DETECTION OF JOB FAILURES
:p.
While PANEXIT is passing records to PANVALET it scans for abnormal
termination messages, bad condition codes, JCL errors, and certain
other installation-defined messages.  A flag is set if one of these
messages is found.  If an error condition is detected, PANEXIT
dynamically allocates a new SYSOUT DATA SET before the last data set
of the job is deleted.  At the end of the job the SYSOUT DATA SET is
closed and freed.  Thus the SYSOUT DATA SET is immediately queued for
printing and inspection by production control personnel.
:p.
After a job is processed and its last data set is deleted, PANEXIT
issues an IEFSSREQ MACRO INSTRUCTION.  If a SYSOUT CLASS 'W' DATA SET
is available it is processed by passing a new "++ADD" card to PAN#1;
otherwise, an end-of-file is passed.  PAN#1 then terminates and
returns to the DRIVER (JCLLIST) which again waits until it is either
terminated or posted.
:h3.JCLLIST PRINT CRITERIA - FORCED SYSOUT=A JOB SPOOLING
:p.
The following table lists IBM MESSAGE IDENTIFICATIONS which will set the
print flag and force a job to be printed (in addition to adding it to
the PANVALET spool).  Further details regarding the exact text of these
messages may be found in the appropriate IBM SYSTEM MESSAGES MANUAL.
:fig id=ibmcodes  place=inline
   IEF251I - JOB CANCELLED
   IEF283I - NOT DELETED X
   IEF287I - NOT RECTLGD/CATALGD/UNCATLGD
   IEF450I - ABEND
   IEF452I - JOBFAIL/JOB NOT RUN JCL ERROR
   IEF451I - ENDED BY CC
   IEF453I - JOB FAILED - JCL ERROR
:figcap.IBM MESSAGES INTERCEPTED BY PANSPOOL
:efig
:p.
In some cases, a job will normally complete (RC=0) despite the presence
of IEF283I and IEF287I.  This is an installation consideration and must
be handled on a "per job" basis. Nonetheless, PANSPOOL will intercept
any job generating these messages, setting the print flag and producing
a listing as if the job had "failed".
:h2.PANSPOOL:  DETECTION OF PANVALET ERRORS
:p.
Any printed output which would have normally been produced by PAN#1 is
intercepted by PANEXIT and examined.  For print lines which do not
indicate any unexpected error, the print function is suppressed and
control is returned to PAN#1.  Otherwise, PANEXIT produces a storage
dump (SNAP DUMP) by means of an SVC 99 DYNAMIC ALLOCATION INTERFACE
ROUTINE, and terminates with a message to the operator.
:h3.RECOVERY AND RESTART CAPABILITIES
:p.
PANSPOOL was designed with total recovery capabilities.  It may be
restarted by the operator if failure is due to an external problem,
including operating system failure.  If PANSPOOL fails and cannot be
restarted because of unforseen circumstances, the SYSOUT 'W' DATA SETS
will be available to the user by issuing a JES2 operator command to set
the printer(s) to process CLASS 'W' output.  An OS 'START' COMMAND is
all that is required to reinstate PANSPOOL processing; furthermore,
operations personnel may optionally issue a MVS SECONDARY OPERATOR
FACILITY (SOF) COMMAND of '/PANSPOOL' to start and/or reinstate PANSPOOL
processing.  The following STARTED-TASK JCL is executed when PANSPOOL is
started:
:fig id=sampjcl  place=inline
//PANSPOOL PROC PERF='3'
//IEFPROC  EXEC PGM=JCLLIST,TIME=1439,
//         PERFORM=&PERF
//SYSPRINT  DD  SYSOUT=*
//PANDD1    DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=PROD.PANSPOOL
:figcap.SAMPLE PANSPOOL STARTED-TASK JCL
:efig
:h3.JCLPRINT - TSO SYSMSG CLIST FACILITY
:p.
JCLPRINT is an interactive TSO COMMAND LANGUAGE PROCEDURE (CLIST) used
to access SYSMSG output (JES2 JOB LOG, JCL, EXECUTION MESSAGES)
previously processed by PANSPOOL.  It was designed with the objective
of providing a user-oriented, non-technical communication interface
with the user.  A job may be retrieved by knowing little beyond its
name, number, and date/time of execution.
:p.
Upon execution of the CLIST, the user is presented with concise
questions concerning his requirements.  A response of "?" (question
mark) in most instances will provide a more detailed explanation of
the question and appropriate responses.
:p.
The following is a list of JCLPRINT options (i.e.:  types of input the
user must enter) and a brief description of the sequence of events
that results for each type of response:
:ol
:li
JOBNAME - entered as a string of 8 or less characters;
If the name of the required job is entered, JCLPRINT will list all of
the entries for that jobname present on PROD.PANSPOOL.  The user may
determine which entry corresponds to the particular run of the job he/sh
needs by examining the date and time information provided and noting the
corresponding job number.  Subsequently, JCLPRINT will request the user
for that job number so that it may, in conjunction with the jobname,
derive the PANNAME for the requested job.  JCLPRINT then proceeds to
retrieve the PANVALET DATA SET (PANNAME) and asks the user whether he/sh
wants a hard copy listing.  A reply of "yes" invokes the dynamic
allocation of a SYSOUT DATA SET in which the contents of the retrieved
PANVALET DATA SET are written.  The SYSOUT DATA SET is then freed and
queued for printing.  A reply of "no" lists the retrieved data set on
the CRT and the user is given another chance to request a hard copy
listing.  The "temporary" data set created by the retrieve process is
then deleted and the user is prompted for the next request.
:li
PANNAME - entered as a string of 10 characters;
The user would enter a PANNAME if he/she already knows the job required
(e.g. by looking at 'JCLDAILY' output).  In this case JCLPRINT skips
the listing of PROD.PANSPOOL entries for the job and goes directly to
the retrieval process.  From there, it continues as if a jobname had
been specified.
:li
VOLSER  - entered as a string of 6 digits (leading zeros included);
A volume serial number is entered for the purposes of retrieving one or
more jobs that had been previously archived to tape by JCLDAILY or
JCLWEKLY.  Since these jobs are no longer on PROD.PANSPOOL, JCLPRINT
prompts the user for the PANNAMES (as given in JCLDAILY or JCLWEKLY
output) of the jobs required, and constructs a job consisting of an
execution of the PAN#2 program.  The job is then submitted for execution
and the user may examine the SYSMSGS retrieved (option '5' below) after
its successful completion.  The retrieved jobs reside on the PANVALET
LIBRARY PROD.TAPELIST.
:li
NEW    - entered as ".NEW" or as ".N";
:p.
This produces a directory listing of PROD.PANSPOOL for jobs that have
not yet been accessed by the JCLPRINT CLIST.
:li
OLD    - entered as ".OLD" or as ".O";
:p.
This produces a complete directory listing of 'PROD.TAPELIST' and sets
JCLPRINT into "OLD" mode such that any subsequent invocations of options
'1' or '2' above refer to jobs that have been previously retrieved from
tape (option '3' above); "OLD" mode remains in effect until ".NEW" is
entered.
:li
ALL    - entered as ".ALL" or as ".A";
:p.
This produces a complete directory listing of PROD.PANSPOOL, or if "OLD"
mode is in effect, produces a directory listing of PROD.TAPELIST.
:li
END    - entered as ".END" or as ".E";
:p.
Terminates JCLPRINT and returns to TSO 'READY' mode; if JCLPRINT is
executed under SPF (IBM PP/5740-XT8), the user is returned to the option
'6' menu.
:eol
:p.
In addition, the MEMOREX 'PANVIEW' PROGRAM may be used to display any
member residing on PROD.PANSPOOL or PROD.TAPELIST simply by allocating
a 'PANDDX' ('X' being any valid alphanumeric character) to the
library in question.  Further details on the use of 'PANVIEW' may be
obtained by typing 'HELP PANVIEW' upon logging on MVS/TSO.  PANVIEW
requires a 3270 (or compatible) type terminal in order to make use of
its full-screen I/O.
:h3.THE ARCHIVAL FACILITY
:h4.JCLDAILY
:p.
This job is executed five days per week (JCLMTHLY is executed on the
first of the month) for purposes of freeing space on PROD.PANSPOOL. The
archival utility, 'JCLARCH', invokes the PAN#2 program which removes
from PROD.PANSPOOL any PANVALET DATA SETS older than 48 hours, merges
them with the previous day's tape, and produces a new output tape whose
second file (DSN = MRX.JCLLIST) contains all of the jobs archived from
PROD.PANSPOOL during the current week.  The first file of the tape (DSN
= PSPLVTOC) contains a directory of the contents of the second file.  A
listing of this directory is produced during each run of JCLDAILY, and
it may be used for determining the PANNAME corresponding to any given
job in the event that a retrieval from tape (using option '3' of
JCLPRINT) is necessary.  Each output tape constitutes a new generation
of a generation data group (GDG) 'MRX.JCLLIST' and is retained for a
period of forty-five days.
:p.
It should be noted that in some cases both the START/STOP and
TIME-AND-DATE STAMP FIELDS may appear blank in the comments portion of
the archival report; this may occur, for example, when the
reader-interpreter detected a JCL error prior to job execution.  As a
result PANSPOOL is unable to extract this information from the job
termination messages (IEF375I and IEF376I) and consequently leaves these
fields incomplete in the PANVALET comment card.
:h4.JCLMTHLY
:p.
This is similar to JCLDAILY except that the previous day's tape is not
used for input.  Instead, the output tape contains only those PAN DATA
SETS which are removed from PROD.PANSPOOL (i.e.:  those older than 72
hours).  This output tape is used for input during the following day's
JCLDAILY run.  In addition, the previous day's tape (i.e.:  last week's
final tape) is opened and closed for the purpose of placing a
retention period of 2 years on it along with a corresponding update to
the UCC1 Tape Management Catalog (TMC).
:p.
The second step of JCLMTHLY is a PAN#2 execution which deletes from the
PANVALET LIBRARY, 'PROD.TAPELIST', any data sets that have already been
examined (as a result of a retrieval request taken by operations and/or
restart personnel).
:h2.INSTALLATION NOTES AND GUIDELINES
:ul
:li
Must be LINKEDITED as authorized and placed in an authorized library,
:li
Care must be exercised in the LINKEDIT of JCLLIST with particular
attention to correct ENTRY POINT specification; GETJFCB and GETPAN2 must
be assembled and LINKEDITED prior to compiling JCLARCH to avoid
unresolved external references; no restrictions on PANPRT (used by the
'JCLPRINT' CLIST); the LINKAGE EDITOR will issue IEW0241/IEW0461 with a
return code of '4' during the LINKEDIT of JCLLIST - this may be ignored,
:li
Contains INSTALLATION DEPENDENT CODE - may require some re-coding to
scan for appropriate JCL MESSAGE IDENTIFIERS -or- as IBM adds,
deletes, or changes message ID's within MVS (e.g. the originating
installation required checks for MESSAGE IDENTIFIERS generated by a
7080 EMULATOR; a Memorex modification was made to eliminate a check
for 'DUMP8' as an operator reply and instead check for a reply of
'CANCEL') - a table-driven, idenpendently-assembled and loaded scan
facility would be a highly desirable future enchancement,
:li
A minor modification was made within JCLLIST to support an extended SSOB
- (a Memorex modification to provide a more meaningful external writer
separator routine in support of our Honeywell Page Printing System);
details of this modification are documented within the source code,
:li
The version as distributed by Memorex Corporation contains substantial
changes in the archival program to produce a 'cleaner' report;  time
providing, this utility should be thoroughly re-written and documented
as it is perhaps the weakest link in the entire system,
:li
The JCLPRINT CLIST contains 'CLR3270' COMMAND PROCESSOR ENTRIES which
will have to be modified and/or removed;  it may be replaced with the
'KOMM' TSO COMMAND PROCESSOR from the MVS/CBT PROJECT MODS tape to
simply clear a 3270-type terminal (this is mandatory if the CLIST is to
be executed from a TTY-type device);  CLR3270 is only used for
formatting the PAN/TSO output upon the screen in a more 'readable'
fashion,
:li
The documentation file is distributed in SCRIPT input format and may be
printed on a TN PRINT TRAIN using ASCII carriage control; the 'SCRIPTED'
library may be reproduced by using IEBGENER or a comparable utility,
:li
With modification PANSPOOL should function with applied DATA RESEARCH's
'LIBRARIAN' through use of the "FILE ACCESS INTERFACE ROUTINES" ('FAIR'
ROUTINES),
:li
PANSPOOL is distributed with the disclaimer that neither Memorex
Corporation, Pansophic Systems, Inc., nor the author are responsible for
the correct operation of the program; no non-disclosure agreement is
intended.
:eul
:p.
Note that the PANSPOOL task will remain in an 'OUTPUT LONG-WAIT'; it
will issue an STIMER every thirty seconds to check for the presence of
any SYSOUT=W output.  Installations using the UICC 'JTIP' PRODUCT
(JES2/TSO INTERFACE PACKAGE) will have to release jobs from the FETCH
QUEUE before they can be intercepted by JCLLIST.  In addition, up to
eight SYSOUT CLASSES may be simultaneously intercepted by changing the
'DC' after label 'SSFUNC' in module 'JCLLIST'; likewise, the RE-QUEUE
class may be modified to installation standards by changing the 'DC'
after label 'PRSYSOUT' as well.
.ce
REQUIREMENTS:
:p.
PANSPOOL requires approximately 24K bytes of on-line storage. CPU usage
per job is less than one CPU second (AMDAHL 470V/6-I); the PANVALET
LIBRARY in use at Memorex was allocated on a 3650 occupying 100
cylinders.  PANSPOOL is operational on MVS 3.6/3.7/3.8 with JES2/4.1,
UICC'S JTIP (JES2/TSO INTERFACE PACKAGE) 1.2, and PANVALET/TSO 9.1 and
10.
:p.
The distribution tape materials include source code for the PANSPOOL
(JCLLIST) JES2 EXTERNAL WRITER, the JCLPRINT CLIST, JCLARCH (PL/I
ARCHIVAL UTILITY), the PANVIEW DISPLAY UTILITY (TSO HELP information
included), machine-readable documentation, and operating instructions.
