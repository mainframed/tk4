 Notes on this option:

+  Input is a single member specified by the project, group, type, and
   member fields or, if it is entered, the "other DSN" field.  Example:

      PROJECT%===> TSO     +
      GROUP  %===> DUS     +
      TYPE   %===> SOURCLIB+
      MEMBER %===>         +  OTHER DSN%===> 'DUS.SOURCLIB(ASMMEM)'+

+  Macro libraries may be specified on the lines provided.  These will
   be searched before 'SYS1.MACLIB' and 'JH.MACLIB'. %Note:+the input
   library will not be searched for macros unless it is also specified
   as a maclib.

+  The "LINK TO" field should specify a link library.  If the link
   member name is blank, the member name in the link library defaults to
   the source member name.  Link edit parms should not be contained in
   quotes; quotes will be generated.  Link syslibs specified will be
   searched ahead of 'SYS1.PRODUCT'.
