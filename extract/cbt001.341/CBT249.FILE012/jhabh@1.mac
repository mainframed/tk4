+  The JH batch processing option generates job statements and JCL for
   executing processing and utility programs.  Generated JCL is placed i
   temporary data set until a request is made for the job to be submitte
   canceled, or edited.

   Screen flow in the John Hancock batch processing option (9) works in
   manner similar to batch processing option 5.  When 9 is entered on th
   primary option menu, the JH batch selection menu is displayed.  In ad
   to the suboption, the variuos job information fields should be review
   modified, if necessary.

   Job JCL is generated based on the parameters entered on the JH batch
   selection menu.  Some validity is performed, but it is up to the user
   ensure that the fields contain valid JCL parameters.
