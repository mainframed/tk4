%TUTORIAL ---------------- BATCH FORMAT PURGE -------------------------
%COMMAND ===>_ZCMD
+
+   Format purge removes MIDS/MODs and DIF/DOFs from FORMAT and REFERAL
    libraries.  It also removes those entries from the MFS incore index
    by executing the MFS service utility program.  For IMSA and IMST
    purges, the job class will be forced to D and C, respectively to
    ensure that the job is not started while on-line is up.  Because of
    this option%10+may only be chosen from the initial JH BATCH
    selection menu, not after any other option has been chosen.
+
+   The batch format purge option will not delete member from production
    libraries.
+
+   See the MFS Users Guide for additional information.
