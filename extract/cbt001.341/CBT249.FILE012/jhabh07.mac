 NOTES ON THIS OPTION:

   THE OPTION OPERATES DIFFERENTLY FROM OPTION 5.7.  IT ALLOWS A MODULE
   TO BE RE-LINKED AND TO INCLUDE OTHER MODULES.

   INPUTS ARE LOAD LIBRARIES.  THESE MAY BE ENTERED AS DD1 AND DD2:

        INPUT LOAD LIBRARIES (Referenced by control cards):
                    DD1%===> 'TSO.DUS.LINKLIB'             +
                    DD2%===>                               +

   IF, HOWEVER, THE OUTPUT AND INPUT LIBRARIES ARE THE SAME, IT IS NOT
   NECESSARY TO SPECIFY A DD1 OR DD2, SINCE AN%INCLUDE SYSLMOD()+CARD
   MADE BE USED. %NOTE:+DD1 AND DD2 WILL NOT BE INCLUDED AS AUTOMATICALL
   SEARCHED LIBRARIES UNLESS THEY ARE ALSO ENTERED AS "LINK SYSLIBS".

   OUTPUT (SYSLMOD) IS THE "MEMBER NAME" SPECIFIED FOR THE "LINK TO"
   LIBRARY.
