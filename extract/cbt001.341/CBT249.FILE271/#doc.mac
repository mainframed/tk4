This library contains a complete Dynamic Proclib modification.  This
modification is compatible with all versions of MVS from base 3.8 to
MVS/XA 2.1.2.

Two complete versions of the SMP format modifications are provided.
One is for MVS/SP 1.3.3 (#Z7700x members) and the other is for
MVS/SP 2.1.2 (#Z7800x members).  These modifications will need to
be reworked for previous and future levels of the Converter.

The source code for the additional module (IEFVPP) is fully compatible
with all levels of MVS.  However, it does contain an SPLEVEL macro
which will have to be removed if assembled with a pre-MVS/SP 1.3
MACLIB.

IEFCVRWA is the Converter Work Area mapping macro from the MVS 3.8
Optional Materials.  It is necessary to properly assemble IEFVPP.
It is currently NOT necessary to obtain a version of this macro from
the licensed Optional Materials provided with the MVS/SPs, as all
referenced data fields are unchanged.  However, this may change in
the future.

Extensive documentation on the installation and function of this
Dynamic Proclib Modification can be found in the Comments in the
SMP Modifications and the source for IEFVPP.

Since 1977, this modification has had only one major change (other
that chaning the Converter ZAPs).  This was to support the SJF feature
added in MVS/SP 1.3.2.  The change was made to be compatible across
all levels of MVS and to eliminate the future dependence on the size
of the Converter Work Area.  This change took all of ONE DAY to make.
Hence, this modification can be considered quite stable.
