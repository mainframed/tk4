               PRIVATE PROCLIB MODIFICATIONS
               VERSION 3, RELEASE 1, MODIFICATION 0

               THIS LOCAL MODIFICATION, ALONG WITH ITS
               COMPANION CO-REQUISITES, TOTALLY INTEGRATES THE
               NECESSARY SYSTEM MODIFICATIONS FOR DYNAMIC PROCLIB
               SUPPORT.

               #Z77001  SGIEF441  SYSGEN MACRO UPDATE AND JCLIN
               #Z77002  IEFVPP    NEW CONVERTER MODULE
               #Z77003  IEFVHF    ZAP FOR LINKAGE TO IEFVPP3
               #Z77004  IEFVFA    ZAP FOR LINKAGE TO IEFVPP4 & IEFVPP5
               #Z77005  IEFVHE    ZAP FOR INTERPRETER JOBPROC BYPASS

               IEFVHE

               IEFVHE IS THE INTERPRETER GET AND ROUTE ROUTINE.  THE
               ZAP CHANGES IEFVHE TO CHECK FOR A "JOBPROC" DD
               STATEMENT AND BYPASS PROCESSING IT.  THIS IS TO KEEP
               THE JOBPROC STATEMENT(S) FROM BEING PROCESSED BY THE
               INTERPRETER.  IF THIS IS NOT DONE, ANY JOB WITH A
               JOBPROC DD STATEMENT WILL RECEIVE A "MISPLACED DD
               STATEMENT" JCL ERROR.

               THE BYTE USED TO CONTAIN THE FLAG BIT IN THE
               INTERNAL TEXT HAS BEEN CHANGED FROM THE FOURTH
               TO THE THIRD BYTE.  THIS IS TO ACCOMODATE THE
               USE OF THE PREVIOUSLY USED FLAG BY THE CONVERTER
               ITSELF.

               THIS MODIFICATION DOES NOT NEED TO PRE-REQ OR CO-REQ
               ANY OF THE OTHER MODIFICATIONS FOR DYNAMIC PROCLIB,
               AS IT DOES NOT HAVE ANY DEPENDANCIES ON THE
               EXISTANCE OF THE OTHER CODE.  THE PRE-REQUISITES
               LISTED ARE TO INSURE THAT ALL OF THE OTHER PIECES
               ARE PROPERLY INSTALLED.  IF THIS MOD IS
               LEFT OFF, HOWEVER, ANY JOB THAT CONTAINS "JOBPROC"
               DD STATEMENTS WILL RECEIVE A JCL ERROR.

                                                                  */ .
