               THIS OBJECT DECK WAS ASSEMBLED USING THE RESERVED WORD
               "RFULLE" IN THE CONVERTER WORK AREA USED AS THE ANCHOR

  PREFACE
               THESE MODIFICATIONS ARE CONSTRUCTED IN FIVE SEPARATE
               PIECES BECASUE OF FUNCTIONAL OWNERSHIP AND
               MAINTENANCE PACKAGING.  IN ADDITION, THERE IS AN
               OPTIONAL MODIFICATION TO JES2 SUPPLIED IN THE
               TEXT OF THESE COMMENTS.

               THE ORIGINAL SOURCE OF THIS MOD IS MUTUAL LIFE OF
               WATERLOO, ONTARIO, CANADA.  AMDAHL HAS PROVIDED
               SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES IN THE METHODS OF INSTALLATION
               AND INTERFACES, AS WELL AS FUNCTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS.
               THE BASIC LOGIC, HOWEVER, IS UNCHANGED.

               THE IEFVPP MODULE HAS BEEN REWRITTEN TO BE COM-
               PATIBLE WITH ALL VERSIONS OF THE MVS CONVERTER
               THROUGH MVS/SP 2.1.1.  HOWEVER, IT SHOULD BE
               REASSEMBLED WHENEVER A CHANGE IS MADE TO THE
               CONVERTER WORK AREA MACROS (IEFCOMWA AND IEFCVRWA).

  JCLIN
               A JCLIN IS NECESSARY TO INCLUDE THIS
               SUPPORT INTO AN EXISTING SYSTEM.
               HOWEVER, IN DOING SO, THE CHANGE OF THE EXTERNAL
               REFERENCE TO IEFVHA IN IEFVH1 WILL NOT HAVE TAKEN
               PLACE AND THE INCORPORATION OF PRIVATE PROCLIB SUPPORT
               WILL BE INCOMPLETE.  SPECIFICALLY, THE CONVERTER WILL
               FAIL IN THE MOST HORRIBLE WAY IF THE SUPERZAPS TO
               THE VARIOUS CONVERTER MODULES HAVE BEEN PUT ON.
               THE JCLIN IS INCLUDED IN THE MODIFICATION THAT
               UPDATES THE SYSGEN MACRO, SGIEF409.  A TECHNIQUE
               TO EFFECT THE CHANGE IS DESCRIBED LATER.

               THE JCLIN IS AS FOLLOWS:

               JCLIN .

              //SG13 EXEC LINKS,
              //  PARM='NCAL,LIST,XREF,LET,RENT',NAME=LINKLIB
              //SYSLIN DD *

                INCLUDE AOSB3(IEZNCODE)
                INCLUDE AOSB3(IEZDCODE)
                INCLUDE AOSB3(IEFVGM90)
       ====>    INCLUDE AOSB3(IEFVPP0)
                ENTRY IEFVH1
                NAME IEFVH1(R)
              /*

               THIS JCLIN WAS TAKEN FROM THE SYSGEN STAGE 2.  THE
               TWO STATEMENTS MARKED BY "====>" ARE THE ADDED
               STATEMENTS.  CURRENT STAGE 1 OUTPUT SHOULD BE CHECKED
               BEFORE THE JCLIN AND ANY NECESSARY CHANGED BY MADE.

               A UCLIN TO DELETE THE LMOD ENTRY MAY
               BE NECESSARY, AS SMP MAY IGNORE THE "CHANGE"
               STATEMENT FOR IEFVH1 IF IEFVH1 IS ALREADY
               DEFINED TO IT (NOT SO HOT, EH?).
               THE UCLIN MAY NOT BE NECESSARY IN MVS 3.8
               WITH SMP 4.

               UCLIN .
               DEL LMOD (IEFVH1) .
               ENDUCL .

               NEITHER THE JCLIN OR UCLIN IS NECESSARY WHEN
               INSTALLING THESE MODS PRE-GEN.

  SYSGEN MACRO
               THE SYSGEN MACRO, SGIEF409, IS MODIFIED TO CONTAIN
               THE NECESSARY LINK EDIT CONTROL STATEMENTS TO FULLY
               INCORPORATE THE MODIFICATION AND TO INSURE THAT A
               RE-SYSGEN DOES NOT "DOWN LEVEL" THE MODIFICATION.

               THE MACRO MODIFICATIONS CONSIST OF CHANGING
               THE EXTERNAL REFERENCE TO IEFVHA IN IEFVH1 TO
               REFER TO IEFVPP0, WHICH IS THE PRIVATE PROCLIB
               INITIALIZATION ENTRY POINT, AND INCLUDING MODULE
               IEFVPP, WHICH IS A NEW MODULE THAT CONTAINS ALL
               PRIVATE PROCLIB SUPPORT, EXCEPT THE SUPERZAPS THAT
               CAUSE THE VARIOUS PRIVATE PROCLIB ENTRY POINTS TO
               BE ENTERED.

  SUPERZAPS
               SUPERZAPS ARE MADE TO THE CONVERTER/INTERPRETER
               TO PERFORM THE LINKAGE TO THE PRIVATE PROCLIB
               SUPPORT AND PROVIDE THE IEFUJV INTERNAL TEXT EXIT
               FOR A JOB STREAM MANAGER.  SEE THE CO-REQUISITE
               MODIFICATIONS FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE LOGIC
               ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OF THE MODIFICATIONS.
               THE MODULES ZAPPED ARE IEFVHF, IEFVFA, AND IEFVHE.

  NEW MODULE
               IEFVPP IS THE NEW MODULE ADDED FOR THIS SUPPORT.
               IT IS COMPATIBLE WITH ALL CURRENTLY AVAILABLE
               VERSIONS OF THE CONVERTER/INTERPRETER.
               HOWEVER, IT IS DEPENDENT ON THE EXISTANCE OR
               NON-EXISTANCE OF MVS/SE RELEASE 2.  THE SOURCE
               MODULE MUST BE ASSEMBLED WITH THE PROPER
               LEVEL OF "SYS1.AMODGEN" IN ORDER FOR IT
               TO FUNCTION PROPERLY.  CONDITIONAL ASSEMBLY IS
               USED TO IMPLEMENT THE NECESSARY LOGIC
               CHANGES AND CONTROL BLOCK DEPENDENCIES.
               CONSULT THE ASSEMBLY LISTING OF IEFVPP FOR SPECIFIC
               INFORMATION ON ITS FUNCTIONS AND LOGIC.

               THE SU MACRO FOR MVS/SE RELEASE 2 (IHASU74)
               IS USED TO EFFECT THE CONDITIONAL ASSEMBLY.
               IT IS ASSUMED THAT ALL RELEASES OF MVS/SP
               WILL PROVIDE THIS MACRO WITH THE SU BIT
               TURNED ON.  IF NOT, THEN THE SOURCE OF IEFVPP
               WILL HAVE TO BE UPDATED ACCORDINGLY.

               IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE IEFVPP SOURCE MODULE
               BE ASSEMBLED BY THE INSTALLATION AND THAT THE
               OBJECT DECK PROVIDED IN THE MODIFICATION BE
               REPLACED WITH THE ONE CREATED BY THE ASSEMBLY.

  JOB ENTRY SUBSYSTEM SUPPORT
               JES2 IS FULLY SUPPORTED AS THE DYNAMIC PROCLIB
               CODE IS NOT SENSITIVE TO THE LEVEL OF JES THAT
               IS RUNNING.  HOWEVER, IT MAY HAVE SOME PROBLEMS
               IN A JES3 ENVIRONMENT, WHERE PERFORMING THE
               DYNAMIC ALLOCATION OF PROCLIBS IS NOT SUBJECT
               TO JES3 SETUP CONTROL.  NO ATTEMPT HAS BEEN
               MADE BY THE AUTHORS TO RUN IT IN A JES3 ENVIRONMENT.

               THIS CODE FULLY SUPPORTS THE USE OF DYNAMIC
               PROCLIB(S) BY STARTED TASKS AND TSO USERS.

               THE ABILITY TO REQUEUE A JOB FOR RECONVERSION WHEN
               A PROCLIB VOLUME IS NOT AVAILABLE HAS BEEN REMOVED
               FROM THIS VERSION OF IEFVPP.  IT WAS THOUGHT TO BE
               OF MINIMAL VALUE AND FREQUENTLY LEFT JOBS AWAITING
               CONVERSION FOR LONGS PERIODS OF TIME.

  MSS SUPPORT
               A BY-PRODUCT OF THE MSS IS THAT AN MSS VOLUME
               CONTAINING A PROCLIB MAY NOT BE MOUNTED.  SINCE
               IEFVPP PERFORMS ALL LOCATES AND ALLOCATIONS
               REQUESTING NO MOUNTING, SUCH A PROCLIB WILL
               NOT BE FOUND, AND THE JOB WILL FAILED WITH A
               JCL ERROR.  HOWEVER, EVEN IF THE MSS VOLUME
               CONTAING THE PROCLIB IS MOUNTED, IEFVPP WILL
               BE STILL INDICATE A JCL ERROR, AS THERE COULD
               BE SUBSTANTIAL DELAYS IN THE CONVERTER
               IF IT HAS TO WAIT FOR STAGING OR CYLINDER
               FAULTS.  SINCE THE CONVERTER IS A SERIAL
               PROCESS, THIS CAN CAUSE SERIOUS DELAYS
               IN JOB PROCESSING, MOST NOTICABLE IN TSO
               LOGONS (BEING STACKED BEHIND A JOB STUCK
               CYLINDER FAULTING IN THE CONVERTER).

  INSTALLATION
               AN APPROACH TO PUTTING THE PRIVATE PROCLIB SUPPORT
               ON IS:
               1.  APPLY THE SYSGEN MACRO UPDATE AND THE NEW
                   MODULE MODIFICATION.  AT THIS POINT, THE
                   JCLIN WILL HAVE BEEN DONE AND THE NEW MODULE
                   (IEFVPP) WILL HAVE BEEN LINKED INTO THE
                   CONVERTER, BUT DYNAMIC PROCLIB WILL NOT
                   BE FUNCTIONING (THE CONVERTER WILL
                   STILL FUNCTION, HOWEVER).
               2.  CREATE A "DUMMY" SUPERZAP FOR MODULE IEFVH1.
                   APPLY THIS ZAP TO IEFVH1.  THIS WILL STILL NOT
                   CAUSE DYNMAIC PROCLIB TO WORK, AS THE
                   EXTERNAL REFERENCE TO IEFVH1 POINTING TO IEFVHA
                   WILL NOT HAVE BEEN CHANGED.
               3.  RESTORE THE ZAP TO IEFVH1.  THIS WILL CAUSE A
                   RE-LINK OF IEFVH1 AND SMP WILL INSERT THE CHANGE
                   STATEMENT, CAUSING IEFVH1 TO NOW POINT TO
                   IEFVPP0 IN IEFVPP.
               4.  APPLY THE ZAPS TO IEFVHF, IEFVHE, AND IEFVFA.
               5.  SINCE IEFVH1 AND IEFNB903 ARE IN LINKLIB IN
                   MVS/XA, SIMPLY REFRESH THE LLA LINKLIST
                   DIRECTORY.

               SHOULD IT BE NECESSARY TO RESTORE THE CONVERTER TO ITS
               ORIGINAL STATE, THE FOLLOWING COULD BE USED:
               1.  PERFORM AN SMP RESTORE OF ALL FIVE MODIFICATIONS.
                   THIS ASSUMES THAT THE SAVED CDS WILL BE USED
                   TO RESTORE THE ORIGINAL JCLIN FOR IEFVH1.
                   THE SAME TRICK USED TO FORCE AN INCLUDE OF IEFVH1
                   FROM THE DLIB (THIS TIME WITHOUT THE CHANGE
                   STATEMENT WILL HAVE TO BE DONE).
                   THE IEFVPP CSECT WILL REMAIN BEHIND IN THE
                   IEFVH1 LOAD MODULE, BUT THIS WILL CAUSE NO HARM.
               2.  REFRESH THE LLA.

  PTF LEVEL
               PTF LEVEL FOR THE INDIVIDUAL MODULES IS NOTED
               WITH EACH MODULE.  SOME OF THE CONVERTER
               MODULES WERE STRUCK BY MVS/SE AND MVS/SP, BUT THE CODE
               IS BASICALLY COMPATIBLE WITH ALL SU/PTF COMBINATIONS,
               BUT THE ZAP DISPLACEMENTS AND PATCH AREAS CHANGE.

  CURRENT RESTRICTIONS
               THE LIMIT ON THE NUMBER OF MULTIPLE CONCURRENT
               CONVERTERS IS 16.  ANYONE WHO HAS A PROBLEM WITH
               THIS DESERVES IT.

                                                                */  .
