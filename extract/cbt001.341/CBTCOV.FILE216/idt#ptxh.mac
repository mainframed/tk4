+ MSG              You may, in addition to transmitted a data set,
+                  append messages to your transmission by simply
+                  specifying the MESSAGE keyword.  Your input may
+                  be in line mode (LINE keyword) or in full screen
+                  (FULLSCREEN keyword).  Your input will default to
+                  FULLSCREEN mode if you are logged onto a 3270
+                  Information Display System terminal with a
+                  minimum screen size of 24 rows by 80 columns.

+ COPYLIST         You may request the TRANSMIT command to build
+                  a list of addressees and append it as a prolog
+                  to the message you are transmitting.  If you are
+                  transmitting a data set, the list of addressees
+                  will be transmitted as an accompanying message.
+
+ NOCOPYLIST       You may request the TRANSMIT command not
+                  build and append a list of addressees with a
+                  transmission by specifying this keyword. This
+                  is the DEFAULT if you do not specify either
+                  keyword.
