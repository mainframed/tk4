+                  the transmitted data set (the sender's userid
+                  will be replaced with your userid).  If this
+                  default data set already exists and is a
+                  sequential data set and you have not specified
+                  a disposition (SHR/MOD/OLD/NEW), then RECEIVE

+
+ UNIT             You may specify a unit type for the output
+                  data set to reside on. If you do not specify
+                  this keyword, your installation default unit
+                  specification will be used.
+
+ VOLUME           You may specify the volume serial number of the
+                  device that you wish the output data set to
+                  reside on. The default for this value to let
+                  your system select a volume as defined by your
+                  installation's unit name value.
