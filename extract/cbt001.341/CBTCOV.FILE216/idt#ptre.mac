+                  value if indicated by your installation support
+                  personnel. This parameter value only has meaning
+                  to your installation's exit routines.
+
+ DATASET          You may specifiy the name of the data set to
+                  used to contain the file being received. This
+                  dataset will be created if it does not exist.
+
+                  The dataset name will default to the name of
+                  the transmitted data set (the sender's userid
+                  will be replaced with your userid).  If this
+                  default data set already exists and is a
+                  sequential data set and you have not specified
+                  a disposition (SHR/MOD/OLD/NEW), then RECEIVE
+                  will prompt you for your permission to overwrite
+                  the data set. If the default data set is a
+                  partitioned data set, then identically named
+                  members be automatically replaced.
+
+ DSNAME           You may specifiy the name of the data set to
+                  used to contain the file being received. This
+                  dataset will be created if it does not exist.
