%          EL-Cheapo PUNCH File Transfer to a VM User
+
+     This is 2ISG's beginning solution to sending%punch+file to a user
+  one of 2ISG's VM systems. A file on the MVS system may be sent to a
+  a VM system over the%Network Job Entry+(NJE) link. The mechanism for
+  this transfer is to have an ISPF panel create a JCL stream to be
+  submitted to the MVS batch system to perform the copy. This file will
+  appear on the VM system of the receiving user as a%READER+file with
+  the VM user being notifed (if persently signed on) of the jobname and
+  the TSO user of who sent the job. The VM user must process the reader
+  file and place it on the appropriate mini-disk (the file should be
+  renamed when it is placed on the mini-disk). Any file sent using this
+  should have a%LRECL=80+and be in card image format.
+
+     The panel will create a batch job stream to perform the transfer
+  to VM. The file must be cataloged on the MVS system for successful
+  completion. The existence of the file will be checked and if it is
+  not cataloged you will be told. If you are transferring a member of
+  a PDS, the existence of the member will be checked (if it does not
+  exist you will be told).
