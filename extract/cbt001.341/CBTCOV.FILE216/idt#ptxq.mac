+                  if indicated by your installation support
+                  personnel.  This parameter value only has meaning
+                  to your installation's exit routines.
+
+ PDS              You may request the TRANSMIT command to preserve
+                  the directory information of the partitioned
+                  data set you are transmitting by specifying this
+                  parameter.  When you specify the PDS keyword
+                  you will force the addressee to restore the
+                  transmitted file as a partitioned data set.
+
+ SEQ              You may request the TRANSMIT command not to
+                  preserve the directory information, but rather
+                  to transmit the partitioned data set as a
+                  sequential data set.  This allows the addressee to
+                  receive the file as a sequential data set or
+                  as a member of a partitioned data set.  You may
+                  only specify SEQ when you specify a single member
+                  of a partitioned data set.
