+          This ISPF/PDF application will allow you to manage your own
+      SLSS. You should have read the distribution SLSS##PR member of
+      the library before beginning to customize the CLIST members,
+      dsnames, and library names.
+
+
+          The SLSS application can handle as many different libraries
+      as is allowed. This is determined by the SLSS#P panel and can
+      be changed. You could have an MVS and VM library, etc.
