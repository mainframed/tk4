+        If the RECEIVE command detects that the file obtained
+        from JES was encihpered by the Interactive Data
+        Transmisison Facility TRANSMIT command, it will
+        automatically attempt to decipher the data. In order
+        to do this, you will be prompted for decipher options
+        which will be passed to the Access Method Services
+        REPRO command. (not supported)
+
+        The RECEIVE command will request that JES retain the file
+        until you successfully receive or delete it. If the RECEIVE
+        command detects any errors while processing a file,
+        the RECEIVE command will automatically retain the file.
+        In cases where the error is related to JES, the RECEIVE
+        command will prompt you to retain the file.
