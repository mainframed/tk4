+        You may invoke the TRANSMIT command in it simplest form
+        by simply entering "TRANSMIT addressee-list". TRANSMIT
+        will default to terminal input and you may now enter
+        your message text.  When the addressee invokes the Interactive
+        Data Transmission Facility RECEIVE command, your message text
+        will be displayed immediately without the addressee having
+        to save and then list it.  When you transmit messages in
+        this manner, they will always be saved in the addressee's
+        LOG and NOT in any other data set. (NOTE: Use of the TRANSMIT
+        MESSAGE keyword will inhibit this function.)
+
+        You may request the TRANSMIT command to encipher your data
+        before transmitting it by specifying the ENCIPHER keyword.
+        You will then be prompted by the TRANSMIT command for the
+        enciphering options which will be passed to the Access
+        Method Services REPRO command. (not supported at 2ISG).
