THIS IS DOCUMENTATION FOR MY TMS# MEMBERS.

   We have installed UCCEL's TMS and it works great for tapes that
are controlled internally. i.i. they never leave the computer center and
are created label=SL.  But how do you account for all those little
tapes IBM and other vendors send to you ??????  Being in the USAF, they
have rules as to where tapes can go (must be the tape library) and they
must be accounted for !!!!!!    So consider this:

    1. VENDORS SEND US TAPES (SL AND NL) TO BE USED AT 2ISG TO INSTALL
       PRODUCTS. WE USUALLY LIKE TO KEEP THEM IN OUR AREA OR DESK JUST
       BECAUSE WE DO NOT TRUST SOMEONE ELSE.
    2. USER'S OF THE COMPUTER CENTER SEND IN TAPES TO USE WITH THEIR
       JOBS. USER'S ALSO WANT YOU TO LOAN (LEASE IN COMMERICAL CONCERN)
       THEM A TAPE TO SHIP SOME DATA SOMEPLACE.
    3. USAF REQUIRES THAT YOU TRACK ALL THOSE TAPES.

   Management was hot to have TMS control everything (after all we spent
big bucks). Well after thinking about it and knowing something about TMS
you know that to let TMS truely control all tapes would be a nightmare.
What management was really asking for was having  TMS manage the
function - a tape comes in, is tracked, etc.

   So while in deep thought (CHEVAS-REGAL), it came to me, follow this:

    1. Define to TMS a series of tapes say X00001-X00500 that will be
       used in the TMS world for MVS system tapes. Define Y00001-Y00500
       for VM system tapes, and Z00001-Z00500 for program products tapes
       like SAS, COBOL, ETC.

    2. Modify the UCCEL 'TMSUPDTE' To change the batch update program
       so it does not produce a LOGO on the listing.  We put it in a new
       member called 'SADUPDTE' out with the change. When you execute
       TMSUPDTE interactively a full page banner page comes out to the
       screen and is a pain. So if you comment out that "PUT" in the
       program, it does not appear.

    3. Now we can invoke 'SADUPDTE' (modified TMSUPDTE) using a CALL
       TSO command and build the batch update cards with CLISTS or ISPF
       skeletons.

    4. We now can use the TMS database for record keeping on the
       system tapes and  we have reports !!!!!

    5. We can also expire in the same way.  Now we can use TMS REPORT
       function to produce pretty lists of tapes. There is now peace
       with our Air Force management !!!!!

    6. Now we took the concept one step further for users' tapes that
       come into the computing center. We can have them tracked and
       when they are due to leave us, we have shipping invoices
       created and more REPORTS !!   How we do that is basically
       described as follows ( if you want to do the same kind of
       procedure you need to go through each panel and clist to
       make sure it is for you - I designed it as general as )
       possible):

       a. allocate the INFO file as a FB/80/6160 PDS to hold the
          user address information.

       b. create a TMS series of tapes that will never be known to
          the users; we did C00001-C00900. Now when tapes come
          in we assigned externally a label of T00001 to T00900.
          Yes, the external label does not match the database series.
          If they matched, then TMS would get very possessive when
          they called for the tapes by database number. This way
          the users will always have to code LABEL=EXPDT=98000 for
          their foreign tapes.

       c. ISPF/PDF panels take care of checking in the tapes and
          expiring the tapes and creating invoices (is easy to
          design your own).

       d. If I would have been more knowledgeable in writing ISPF
          applications I would have replaced the INFO file with
          a TABLE.

       e. The most interesting part of this whole thing is the
          interactive updating ability by constructing the control
          cards with skeletons and feeding the cards to a modified
          version of TMSUPDTE.

    7. Now a final word about the reports or documents. Back in 1982, I
       started to use a product called VPS (VTAM Print System) or it
       is also called JES/3270. It allowed us to put JES2 (or JES3)
       sysout files to IBM 328X type printers. Sure beats installing
       IBM 3777s everywhere on separate lines. With the number of
       IBM 328X printers out there and IBM compatible ones, management
       was hot to use them. Also VM/RSCS supported IBM 328X type
       printers and I couldn't be outdone. So most of the reports and
       shipping documents are being sent directly to an IBM 3287 in
       the tape librarian's area.

       Since that time, a number of competing products have come out
       to challenge VPS. IBM even has one called JES328X that is very
       inexpensive. Remember you get what you pay for  !!!!!  With
       the number of PCs and attached printers, most have their
       printers look like IBM 3287s. So I really would investigate
       the capability.
