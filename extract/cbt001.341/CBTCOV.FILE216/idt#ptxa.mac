%        The following is a complete HELP for TRANSMIT
+
+        The TSO/E Interactive Data Transmission Facility TRANSMIT
+        command allows you to send data sets or messages to persons
+        on other MVS systems via Network Job Entry or directly to
+        persons on your own system.
+
+        You may transmit sequential and partitioned data sets that
+        have the fixed, variable and undefined record formats.
+        You MAY NOT transmit ISAM and VSAM data sets, or data sets
+        with user labels or keys.
+
+        When you transmit a partitioned data set, the TRANSMIT
+        command will invoke the IEBCOPY utility and then transmit
+        the unloaded data set. The Interactive Data Transmission
+        Facility RECEIVE command will restore the partitioned
+        data set to its original format. You may also transmit
+        a single member of a partitioned data set and request that
+        it be transmitted as a sequential data set, thereby allowing
+        the addressee to receive it either as a sequential data set
+        or as a member of another partitioned data set.
