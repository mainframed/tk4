%              EL-CHEAPO FILE TRANSFER TO A VM USER
+
+     This is 2ISG's beginning solution to sending a file to a user on
+  one of 2ISG's VM systems. A file on the MVS system may be sent to a
+  VM system over the%Network Job Entry+(NJE) link. The mechanism for
+  this transfer is to have an ISPF panel create a JCL stream to be
+  submitted to the MVS batch system to perform the copy. This file will
+  appear on the VM system of the receiving user as a%READER+file with
+  the VM user being notifed (if persently signed on) of the jobname and
+  the TSO user of who sent the job. The VM user must process the reader
+  file and place it on the appropriate mini-disk (the file should be
+  renamed when it is placed on the mini-disk). Any file sent with a
+  LRECL of less than 132 will have the file padded with blanks to make
+  it LRECL=132. The user may truncate the trailing blanks off the file
+  when the file is placed on the mini-disk. The maximum LRECL is 255
+  to be received through this mechanism.
+
+     The panel will create a batch job stream to perform the transfer
+  to VM. The file must be cataloged on the MVS system to be transferred
+  to VM. Additionally if a member of a PDS is requested, the panel will
+  check for the existence of the member. If it does not exist, then you
+  will be told.
