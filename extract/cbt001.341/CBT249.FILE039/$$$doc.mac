THIS DATA SET HAS NO INDEX SO YOU WILL HAVE TO
SCAN THE WHOLE THING TO FIND OUT WHAT YOU WANT
BUT THERE IS A LOT OF GOOD STUFF HERE

BECAUSE OF THE OFFLOAD PGM THAT I USE TO PUT
THIS PDS INTO IEBUPDTE FORMAT YOU WILL HAVE
TO MODIFY 2 MEMBERS (MACROS AND MVCLIST)
AND CHANGE >< TO ./      .
EASY ENOUGH TO DO WITH A TSO EDITOR OF SOME SORTS.
