.SUBT Usage
The .FM control word defines the footing margin, which is the
number of blank lines which will be left between the bottom
of formatted text and the first footing line on all pages.
The first footing line is the top of the FOOTING SPACE area.
An operand of the form "+n" or "-n" adds this value
algebraically to the current footing space setting, so long as
the resulting value is not negative.
.sp 1
If the footing margin is f_m_, the footing space is f_s_ and the
bottom margin b_m_, the bottom of each page will appear as follows:
.sp 1
.in 10
.of 4
(1) f_m_ blank lines,
.of 4
(2) the f_s_ footing lines,
.of 4
(3) b_m_ - f_m_ - f_s_ blank lines.
.SUBT Defaults
This control word creates a break when encountered
and until then n_
If the operand is omitted then the value of the FMargin=
parm will be taken, normally 1.
.SUBT Notes
.of 4
(1) The FOOTING MARGIN plus FOOTING SPACE must always be less than
or equal to the BOTTOM MARGIN.
