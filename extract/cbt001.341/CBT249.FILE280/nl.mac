.cm SCRIPT REFERENCE NL
.SUBT Purpose
The line operand of the NULL control word will be treated
as input, either text or control word.
.SUBT Format
×
×  .             <line>
×
.SUBT Usage
The ".
control word indicator, immediately followed by one or more blanks.
Its function is to treat the "line" operand as SCRIPT input.
The "line" operand starts with the first non-blank character
and may be text or another control word.
.sp
This control word has two uses.
The first allows text followed by control words to be entered
on the same input line.
The second allows input lines to be indented for readability.
.SUBT Defaults
This control word will not cause a break.
However, a control word specified in the "line" operand
may cause a break to occur.
If the "line" operand is omitted, a blank input line is assumed.
.SUBT Notes
.of 4
(1) While usually specified with a "blank" control word,
the implementation of this control word allows ".NL" (NulL)
to be specified.
The result is the same.
.SUBT Examples
.tr ^ .
.fo no
.of 4
(1) . this is some text;.sp;and this is more.
.sp
is the same as:
.sp
this is some text
^sp
and this is more.
.sp
.cp begin
.of 4
(2) ^dm TEST begin
^if '&1' = '' .th .do begin
^                     .fo on
^                     .sp
^                     .cp 5
^                 .do end
^             .el &1
^dm TEST end
.sp
Done this way for readability.
