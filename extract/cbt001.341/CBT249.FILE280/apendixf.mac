.us Footnote Numbering:
.sp
In order to allow the greatest flexibility in the placement and
numbering of footnotes and in order to take
advantage of the superscript characters available on a TN print train,
several things were done:
.sp
.in
.of 4
(1) The Variable Symbol "NFN" was used to count footnotes.
Just prior to each footnote reference, the control line ".FNADD"
was used to cause the following Remote file to be "executed":
.sp
.fo no
    .se NFN=&NFN+1;.se LP='';.se OFN=L'&NFN+3;.se i=0
    .ur .pe L'&NFN
    .se i=&i+1;.se FNn=&&NFN(&i:&i);.se LP='&LP&&I&FNn'
    .se LP='&L&LP&R'
.fo yes
.sp
.in
.of 4
(2) A file named "SUPER" was created which contained the
following:
.sp
    .bs +
    .sr L='8+D'
    .sr R='9+D'
    .sr I0='B+0'
        .
        .
    .sr I9='B+9'
.sp
In file "SUPERT" the same variable names were defined with their
non-superscript equivalents.
Then if the "&SYSOUT" system variable symbol had the value
"PRINT" indicating off-line output, the command ".im
was executed.
.sp
.in
.of 4
(3) Each footnote reference of the form "<word><ref>" was entered as
follows:
.sp
    .ur <word>&LP
.sp
which produces a reference of the form "<word>(1)"
for on-line output or
.ur <word>&L.&I1.&R for off-line output.
.sp

(4) Each footnote began:
.sp
    .ur .of &OFN
    .ur (&NFN.) ...
.sp
.in
.cp 4
.us Table of Contents:
.sp
.of 4
(1) Each line in the table of contents was a ".UR" containing an
instance of a mnemonic reference name, which
was set to the page number of the start of the section via ".sr ... %".
.sp
.of 4
(2) The Preface and Table of Contents print with Roman numerals.
The body of the manual starting with the Introduction starts on
page one with Arabic numerals.
.sp
.of 4
(3) The Preface and Table of Contents prints correctly following
the initial title page if the PASS=2 option is specified.
It is suggested however that PASS=1 be used to save on CPU and I/O
costs and that the Preface and Table of Contents which will
then print last be manually moved to the start.
.ur This manual was formatted with PASS=&SYSPASSOF..
.sp
.in
.us Manual Dating:
.sp
The date which appears on the initial title page is a line
of text in input file member "HEADER".
The date reflects the version of SCRIPT to which this manual
corresponds.
.sp
.us File Organization:
.sp
The following SCRIPT files were used during production:
.sp
.of 9
SCRIPT   Manual driver containing general description and imbedding
"HEADER" page, Preface and Table of "CONTENTS", "OPTIONS", "ERRORS"
and the appendices.
.sp
.of 9
NSCRFC1  Contains necessary ".SR", ".PA" and ".IM" control words
to format the individual control word descriptor files and
generate values for reference names used in the Table of Contents.
A table of control words to include is defined by "FCLIST".
This file is imbedded by "SCRIPT".
.sp
.of 9
AD, AP, etc.  Contain detailed descriptions of the control words.
Imbedded by "NSCRFC1".
.in
.sp
.us Manual Format Options:
.sp
By setting reference symbol "&BINDING" to 'CENTRE' the manual will
be formatted for printing on both sides of each page.
This may be changed by specifying '+BINDING=CENTRE' in the parm field.
The current value for "&BINDING" is
.ur '&BINDING'.
.sp
.cp 5
.us Manual Updates:
.sp
By setting reference symbol "&UPDATE" to a date in the form
"YYMMDD" only update pages on or after the date specified
will be printed.
Pages are not numbered, leaving it to the user to insert them at
the appropriate locating in an existing Reference Manual.
.ur The current value for "&&UPDATE" is '&UPDATE'.
