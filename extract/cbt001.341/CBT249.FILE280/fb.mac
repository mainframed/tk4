.cm SCRIPT REFERENCE FB
.SUBT Purpose
The FLOATING BLOCK control word allows the user to enter a block of
text that will print later in the document.
.SUBT Format
×                <BEGIN×END <0_×m>>
×  .FB
×                <DUMP <n>>
.SUBT Usage
The .FB control word defines the beginning and ending
of a block of text that is to be printed later in the document.
When the ".FB
of all relevent print control variables are saved and SCRIPT
prepares to accept Floating Block text.
When the ".FB
caused for text within the block and the former values are restored.
.sp
More than one Floating Block may be defined; each new Block
is added internally to the end of the current formatted blocks.
In this way, a list of Endnotes could be accumulated within
a chapter to be printed at the end, or a list of Reference or
Bibliography entries could be entered at the point of reference
and be printed later.
.sp
The ".FB
formatted block after the "END" operand is encountered.
A second numeric operand may be specified to indicate how
many Floating Blocks are to be printed.  If not specified
then all blocks accumulated to this point are printed.
.SUBT Defaults
This command does not create a break.
A first operand must be provided as none will be assumed.
The default length adjustment for "END" is zero.
The default count of blocks to print for "DUMP" is all blocks.
.SUBT Notes
.of 4
(1) A Conditional Page (.CP BEGIN/END) or a Floating Keep
(.FK BEGIN/END) or a Footnote (.FN BEGIN/END) sequence within
a Floating Block is considered illegal.
.sp
.cp begin
.of 4
(2) The SYSFBC system variable symbol can be examined after the
".FB
within all outstanding blocks.  The SYSFBF system variable symbol
can be used to determine the count of queued lines within the
first outstanding block.
