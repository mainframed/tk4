pages.

where optional "n", from one to the value of the HSFSOVER option,
gives the footing line number
and S1, S2 and S3 are character strings not containing the
delimiter character "/".
The delimiter character can be any character, defined
as the first character of the operand.  Any of the fields may
be omitted, but the delimiter character must be included to
indicate missing fields, e.g., $S1$$S3$.
.SUBT Usage
The .BT control word is used in a way similar
to the .TT control word.  The title items defined with .BT
will be printed in footing lines near the bottom of
even and odd numbered pages.  The number of footing lines printed
is set by .FS (Footing Space).
.SUBT Defaults
A break is not created by this command.  Unless otherwise
specified ".BT
.SUBT Notes
.of 4
(1) The BOTTOM TITLE control has the same effect as the FOOTING (.FE)
control.  The difference is that the field delimiter is self-defined
by the first character of the operand.
