.cm SCRIPT REFERENCE FK
.SUBT Purpose
The FLOATING KEEP control word enables the user to enter a block
of text that will print together, either immediately or at
the top of the next page.
.SUBT Format
×               <BEGIN×END <0_×m>>
×  .FK
×               <DUMP <n>>
.SUBT Usage
The .FK control word defines the beginning and ending of a block
of text that is to print together on one page.
When the ".FK BEGIN" control word is encountered, the values
of all relevent print control variables are saved and SCRIPT
prepares to accept Floating Keep text.
When the ".FK END" control word is encountered the former
values are restored.
.sp
The ".FK END" routine also decides if there is space on
the current page to print the Floating Keep in its entirety.
An optional numeric operand may be used to adjust the actual
size of the Floating Keep for comparison purposes.
If yes, then it will be printed.  If not, the formatted
text will be saved for the top of the next page immediately
following the top margin spacing.
If the text saved exceeds one page in length then it will print
starting at the top of the next page and continue onto subsequent
pages till finished.
.sp
If the Floating Keep text is forced to the next page,
the current page will be filled with the text which follows
the ".FK
.sp
The ".FK DUMP" operand is used to print an outstanding Floating
Keep.  Each outstanding block of text will print at the top of a
page if there is insufficient room on the current page.
A second numeric operand may be specified to indicate how many
Floating Keeps are to be printed.
If not specified then all blocks accumulated to this point are printed.
.SUBT Defaults
This command does not create a break.
An operand must be provided as none will be assumed.
The default length adjustment for "END" is zero.
.SUBT Notes
.of 4
(1) A Conditional Page (.CP BEGIN/END) or a Floating Block
(.FB BEGIN/END) or a Footnote (.FN BEGIN/END) sequence may not
be defined within a Floating Keep.
.of 4
(2) The SYSFKC system variable symbol can be examined after
the ".FK END" control word to determine if the Floating Keep
has printed on the current page or will print on the next page.
