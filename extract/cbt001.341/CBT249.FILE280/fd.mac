where optional "n", from 1 to the value of the HSFSOVER option,
gives the odd footing line number
and S1, S2 and S3 are character strings _n_o_t containing
quotation marks.
Any of the fields may be omitted, but the quotation marks must be
included to
indicate missing fields, e.g., 'S1''S3'.
.SUBT Usage
The .FD control word is used in a way similar to the .HE control
word.  The title items defined with .FD
will be printed in a footing line near the bottom of odd numbered
pages.  The number of footing lines printed on odd pages is
set by .FS (Footing Space).
.SUBT Defaults
A break will not be created when this command is encountered.  Unless
otherwise specified ".fd ''''" will be in effect.
.SUBT Notes

(1) The quotation marks are used to delimit the character strings,
_N_O_T to surround them.
