.SUBT Usage
When SCRIPT encounters a QUIT control word with an affirmative
operand, even in a Remote Sequence or in a file
that is being Imbedded, the output
advances to the top of the next page and clears any
stacked footnotes or text created by ".CP or .FK begin/end"
sequences before termination of all processing for the current pass.
.SUBT Defaults
This command creates a break.
An omitted operand is treated as "YES".
.SUBT Notes

(1) The .QT control word is supported for compatibiblity
with QUIT in former versions of SCRIPT.
The two functions are identical.
