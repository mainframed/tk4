.SUBT Usage
With this control word, records of data may be written to output
utility files.
The first operand may range from one to nine.
The first occurrence of .PU control word for the file causes
the file to be opened.
If the "line" operand is omitted then the output file will be
closed.

records will be added to the end of the file.
If the file is not defined with a disposition of MOD then
output records will replace the file.
.sp
An IMBED (.IM) or APPEND (.AP) with a numeric filename will close
and input a workfile created with .PU.
