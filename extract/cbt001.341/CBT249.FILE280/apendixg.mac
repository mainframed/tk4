There are System Reference Variables that are initialized to values
describing the SCRIPT environment and information about the date
and time.  The following first table shows the variables, and they
all must be in uppercase if the NOUPPER option was specified,
and describes their initial values.  These values may be altered
with SET REFERENCE control words as regular reference variables,
but this is not recommended.
.cp end;.do end
All System Reference Variables begin with 'SYS'
or '$', so that
"SYSDATE" and "$DATE" return the same value.

signal the remote whenever the appropriate circumstance occurs.

SYSBLANK is signalled with
no operands if a blank input line is encountered.
If this REMOTE does not exist, then a ".SK" is substituted.

The following is a useful possibility for such a remote:

SYSIX3   is signalled before each third-level
index entry is printed.
.ur .if &refcard eq N;.do
.sp;.in
The following named remotes are automatically signalled when
a circumstance occurs.
They may manipulate reference variables or titles.
They should not generate text or do spacing as SCRIPT will continue
processing the current page with the event that caused the signal.
.do end
.in 9
.sp;.un 9
SYSBM    is signalled before printing the Bottom Margin area.
.sp;.un 9
SYSBOT   is signalled after printing the Bottom Margin area.
.sp;.un 9
SYSTM    is signalled after printing the Top Margin area.
.sp;.un 9
SYSTOP   is signalled before printing the Top Margin area.
