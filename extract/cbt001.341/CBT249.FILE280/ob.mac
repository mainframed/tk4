Where the optional "n", from 1 to the value of the HSFSOVER option,
gives the footing line number
and S1, S2 and S3 are character strings not containing the
delimiter character "/" which can be any character defined
as the first character of the operand.  Any of the fields may
be omitted, but the delimiter character must be included to
indicate missing fields, e.g., $S1$$S3$.
.SUBT Usage
The .OB control word is used in the same way as the .BT
control word.  The footings defined with .OB will appear only on
.FNADD
.ur odd numbered&LP pages, however.
.fn begin

.ur .of &OFN
.ur (&NFN.) Odd numbered pages are those which have the binding
to the left of the left-hand margin in a book.
.fn end
The number of footing lines printed on an odd page are defined
by .FS (Footing Space).
.SUBT Defaults
A break is not created by this command.  Unless otherwise
specified ".OB
.SUBT Notes
.of 4
(1) The ODD BOTTOM control has the same effect as the ODD FOOTING (.FD)
control.  The difference is that the field delimiter is self-defined
by the first character of the operand.
