.cm SCRIPT REFERENCE RM
.SUBT Purpose
The REMOTE control word allows the user to save one or more input
lines, which will be automatically or under user control
imbedded at a specific place on the current page, the next page, or
subsequent pages.
.SUBT Format

.SUBT
.sp 1
.in 10
Where "n" is:
.sp 1
.in +5
.of 3
.fo
-- an asterisk "*"
.of 3
-- a positive integer from one to PAGE LENGTH
.of 3
-- a positive integer greater than PAGE LENGTH and less than 32767.
.of 3
-- an identifier of eight characters or less.
.SUBT Usage
The input lines between the first .RM and the next .RM are
saved.  When the next line "n" is to be printed
or a SIGNAL REMOTE ".SI
the saved lines are automatically interpreted.
.sp 1
If NOSAVE is specified as a second operand or assumed by default,
the saved lines are erased after the first use.
If SAVE is specified, the remote sequence is saved and invoked on
line "n" of every page until a ".RM
is received specifying the same line number.
If a number "m" is specified then the remote will be deleted
following its "m"th invocation.
A first operand of DELETE will remove all current saved remote
sequences.  This is also done automatically between passes.
.sp 1
If a second operand is specified then SAVE
or NOSAVE may be specified as a third operand.  The SAVE third
operand, which is default, saves the current page formatting
options and sets default page formatting options when the remote
is entered and then restores these options at the end of remote
processing following an implied break.  The NOSAVE third operand
prevents current page formatting options from being maintained
through the remote processing and then restored at the end of
the Remote.  This is most useful when used with SIGNAL REMOTE
".SI", allowing it to be used like a Local Imbed.
.sp;.cp 2
The .RM control word is useful for defining multi-line headers or for
causing automatic insertion
of figures.
.sp
A numbered Remote with a number greater than PAGE LENGTH may only
be triggered with a SIGNAL (.SI) control word.
.sp
A named Remote may be triggered with a SIGNAL (.SI) or with a
user control word of the same name.
The user may intercept native control words by defining
a named remote with the name of a native control word.
.SUBT Defaults
This command word will not create a break when encountered.
The first operand, the name or number of the remote, must be
specified.  If the
first operand is an asterisk "*" then the value of "n" will be
set to the TOP MARGIN plus one, i.e. (n_
.SUBT Notes
.of 4
(1) _A_n_y lines whatever may appear within the .RM
(except another REMOTE ".RM")
and are interpreted when the remote sequence is inserted.
.of 4
.cp 4
(2) Since Remote lines are saved away without interpretation or
examination, it is necessary that the terminating ".RM" control
word start in column one of an input line.
.of 4
.cp 6
(3) Remote sequences are "triggered" when line "n" of the output page
is about to be printed.  While a remote
sequence is being used for input, no other remote may be
automatically triggered.
If two or more remotes specify the same remote name they are ordered
in a last in, first out order so that only the newest will
be triggered.
For numbered remotes, they are queued first in, first out order so
that the oldest will be triggered first.
.of 4
.cp 2
(4) A ".RM
for the specified remote identifier.
.of 4
.cp 6
(5) A user may write his own versions of SCRIPT control words in
terms of other control words or do more checking before issuing
the intended command by naming a remote with a control word.
Note that a control word starting with two control word
indicator characters will bypass the initial search of
named remotes.
.SUBT Examples
.of 4
(1) Assume a TOP MARGIN of 6.  The following sequence places a figure
at the top of the next page:
.sp 1
.in +5
 .rm 7
 .in
    (Figure)
 .ce yes
 FIGURE ONE: Water Concentration in Lake Erie
 as a Function of GNP.
 .ce no
 .rm
.in -5
.sp 1
.of 4
(2) The following remote would define a user control word for new page:
.sp 1
.in +5
 .rm $PA
 .sp 2
 .cp 5
 .se $PACOUNT=$PACOUNT+1
 .rm
  ...
 .$PA;.* this triggers the above remote
 .SI $PA;.* this does the same
.sp
.in -5
.of 4
(3) The following remote would trap page ejects
and merely leave two spaces instead.
.sp
 .rm PA save nosave
 .sp 2
 .rm
.sp
.of 4
(4) The following remote would trap spaces and reduce them to
single spaces.
.sp
 .rm SP save nosave
 ..sp 1
 .rm
.cm End of RM
