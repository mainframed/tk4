.cm SCRIPT REFERENCE SU
.SUBT Purpose
The SUBSTITUTE SYMBOL control word causes subsequent input text
and control lines to be reformatted by substituting the current
values of specified reference names in the line and to be
processed as if it had been in the input.
.SUBT Format
×                <1_×n×ON×OFF×line>
×  .SU           <U_P_P_E_R_×NOUPPER>
×                <TRACEON×TRACEOFF>
.SUBT Usage
The "line" operand or the next "n"
text and control lines in the input file
will be reformatted by substitution with current values
of reference names.  In other words, the next "n" lines
of input will be interpreted as if sufficient ".UR"
USE REFERENCE control words preceded them to remove
all reference names from the string.
.sp
The "UPPER" argument causes all Reference Variables to be
converted to upper case in an assignment or when being used.
Thus "&X" and "&x" would refer to the same variable.
The "NOUPPER" argument causes all Reference Variables to
be used as entered.
This option may also be set using the UPPER or NOUPPER
option when SCRIPT is invoked.
.sp
The "TRACEON" argument uses the SYSTERM error file to print
a record of substitutions under .SU or .UR control words.
The initial input record is listed with double spacing and each
level of substitution is listed with single spacing.
The "TRACEOFF" argument is used to turn this debug feature off.
.SUBT Defaults
The ".SU" control word does not act as a break itself.  A
numeric operand will substitute in the following "n"
input text lines.  A missing operand will substitute in
the one following input text line.  A "ON" operand will
substitute in all following input text lines until an
"OFF" or numbered "n" operand is encountered.
