.si REF$ Purpose:;.****************************************************
The University of Waterloo version of SCRIPT
is a powerful text formatting program.
This introductory guide is an example of its output
but SCRIPT is most useful for the preparation
of large documents and manuals.
.si REF$ Input:;.******************************************************
SCRIPT input consists of formatting control instructions
imbedded within text lines
containing the data to be formatted.
The control words are distinguished by a control word indicator,
normally a period "." in column one of an input record.
The input data is maintained entirely separately from SCRIPT
by the text editor of your choice;  a card punch,
the VM/CMS Editor, the TSO Editor, WYLBUR or WITS.
Output from another program may be used as SCRIPT input.
In an interactive environment under TSO or CMS, input
may be prompted and entered at the user's terminal.
.sp
The input may be fetched from multiple sequential files or from
members of one or more partitioned files.  Thus small sections
of text may be edited independently.  If a small driver routine
is constructed to imbed each section in order, sections
may easily be interchanged or renumbered as more sections
or chapters are added.
.sp
When the data is being formatted into paragraphs it is a good idea,
although not necessary, to start each sentence on a new
input record.  This makes subsequent insertions or deletions
much easier to perform.
.si REF$ Output:;.*****************************************************
The formatted document may always be printed on a high speed printer
for a proof copy.
The output may be translated to upper case and special symbols
may be translated to an approximate equivalent for such proof runs.
The output may be directed to disk for subsequent inspection
by a problem program or a text editor.
Under TSO and CMS, the formatted document may be typed at a terminal,
stopping at the bottom of each page for the next sheet of paper
or stopping in mid-page for a user's text or data line.
.si REF$ Usage:;.******************************************************
Although SCRIPT contains almost one hundred control words, most
documents can be prepared using only
.us eight
commands.
Each formatted line may be filled as nearly as possible
with words, either justified on the right or ragged.
Unformatted lines consist of text copied as is from
the input file.
.sp
Indentation, centering, line length and spacing, page layout
and numbering, top and bottom titles, footnotes, underscoring
and keeping of text together on one page or waiting for
the next are all under user control.
Section or reference numbering may be computed and entire tables
of contents may be built on the fly as each section is formatted
to be dumped later at the document end or at the beginning
by using the multi-pass option.
.si REF$ Basic Control Words;.*****************************************
.bx 6 18 45
          .tt      define top title
          .sp      leave blank line(s)
          .in      indent text from margin
          .of      offset text from indent
          .cp      keep text together
          .fo      set automatic formatting
          .us      for underscoring text
          .fn      footnote control
.bx off
.sp
The above list of control words is the basis for solving
most SCRIPT formatting problems.
Even this list may be too big since the top title is
normally only defined once and footnotes
only occur in a special class of document.
.sp
The bare bones won't last forever, so a basic but not
trivial subset of control words with their functions
and operands are discussed in subsequent sections.
.si REF$ HEADINGS and FOOTINGS;.***************************************
To place chapter headings or titles on a document, use the
".tt" command.  You may always use upper or lower case for
the control words, so ".TT" is equivalent.
A blank always separates the control word from any operands.
The TOP TITLE control word takes three operands separated
by the first character of the operand string.
If page numbering is required then place a percent sign
"%" into one of the three operands.
This character which is settable by the user
is automatically replaced with the current page number.
.sp
     .tt /SCRIPT//Page %/
.sp
The above example would place "SCRIPT" in the upper left
corner of each page,
nothing or a null string in the top center and "Page
in the upper right corner where "n" is the current page number.
.sp
     .bt //-%-//
.sp
This command, BOTTOM TITLE, is used to define the line to appear
below formatted text on each page.
This example would place the current page
number at the bottom center of each page, surrounded by dashes.
.si REF$ SPACES and BREAKS;.*******************************************
The SPACE control word ".sp" is used to delimit paragraphs of
text or leave blank lines in the formatted output.
The operand is an integer or expression specifying
the number of lines to be left blank.
.sp;.cp 3
     .sp 5
     .sp
.sp
The first example leaves five blank lines, the second example
the default of one.  Note that blank lines at the top of a page
are normally suppressed.
.sp
A BREAK in the formatting of output text means terminating
the current output line, no matter how full it may be,
and starting the next line at the left margin.
Some commands such as SPACE do this implicitly.
A leading blank in a text line also implies a break with
an indentation.
The BREAK control word ".br" takes no operand and gives the user
control to end the current line.
.sp;.cp 4
     The glorious beer of Copenhagen.
     .br
     Cheers!
.sp
The effect is to break the assertive from the expletive by
starting a new output line.
.br;Cheers!
.si REF$ INDENTATION and JUSTIFICATION;.*******************************
All text is normally justified against the left margin.
To indent following text a specific number of spaces use the
INDENT ".in" control word.
This indentation will remain in effect until another ".in"
control word is encountered.
Consider these three examples:
.sp;.cp 4
     .in 10
     .in +5
     .in
.sp
The first example indents all text ten spaces from the left
margin.  The second signed example increments the current
indent value by five.  The last example cancels all indentation
of text and reverts to the left margin.
.sp
     To indent only the first line of a paragraph, you should
start the input record containing the first sentence with the
number of blanks to be indented.
The first sentence of this paragraph started with five blanks.
.sp
The LINE LENGTH control word ".ll" may be used to define the
length of formatted text lines.
The operand can be an absolute numeric value,
a signed numeric to alter the current value or if
omitted, the default of sixty will be assumed.
The following are possible examples:
.sp;.cp 4
     .ll 55        - sets line length to 55;
     .ll -5        - decrements current line length;
     .ll           - resets with the default value.
.sp
The ADJUST control word ".ad" may be used to alter the physical
left margin value.  The adjust value globally moves all formatted
output to the right of the physical left margin of the
output device.
The width of formatted text defined by ".ll"
remains unchanged.
.sp
     .ad 10
.sp
You may do this at the start of your input to allow a sufficient
margin on the left of your output for binding.
.sp
To offset all lines of text except the first, use the OFFSET
control word ".of".  Specify the number of spaces to be offset
from the current indent as an integer.
The ".of" value set remains in effect until the next ".of"
or ".in" control word is used.
Many lists of examples or notes could be formatted as follows:
.sp
.li )
.ll -10
)br
.in 6
)br
.of 4
)ll -10
)in 6
)of 4
(1) This is point number one.  The body of the text
has been indented ten spaces from the left by
indenting 6 for the bracketed number and offsetting
four more thereafter.
)in
.of 4
)in 6
)of 4
(2) This is point number two.  These points are effectively
indented from the right as well by decrementing the line
length by ten with a ".ll
)in
.in
)ll +10
.ll +10
)li .
.sp
.ju no
All the paragraphs up to now have been justified.  That is,
enough extra spaces have been inserted into every line to exactly
align the right margin.  Ordinary typewriter style, with a
ragged right margin, results if a NO JUSTIFY control word
".ju
a ".ju
.sp
.cp 9
.li )
.in +5
)br
.of 5
)br
.ju no
)in +5;)of 5;)ju no
This paragraph was indented (.in) five spaces and the right margin was
made ragged with (.ju).  Furthermore all lines after the first
were offset another five spaces.  We will now revert.
)in
.in -5
)br
.ju yes
)li .
.ju yes
.si REF$ TABLES and PAGES;.********************************************
Normally SCRIPT automatically formats and rearranges all text by
filling each output line to the maximum.
This facility is undesirable for charts, figures and tables.
To reproduce output text in exactly the same format as input text
one could place a ".br" between each line.
It is easier to disable all automatic formatting of lines with
a FORMAT control word with a negative operand, ".fo
To resume automatic formatting, a ".fo
simply just ".fo" will do the job.
For example:
.sp;.cp 10
.tr ^ . + /;.* TRANSLATE CONTROL WORDS AND JCL
.in +5;.fo no
The following is the required JCL:
^sp
^fo no
^in 5
^cp 6
++  EXEC  PGM=SCRIPT
++STEPLIB  DD  ...
^..
^fo yes
.in -5;.fo yes
.tr;.* RESET OUTPUT TRANSLATE TABLE
.sp
To prevent tables or even formatted text from being split
over two pages use the CONDITIONAL PAGE EJECT control word ".cp".
If your table is ten lines long then use the following command
line to keep the table together on one page.
.sp
     .cp 10
.sp
If less than ten lines remain on the current page, SCRIPT will
put the entire table at the top of the next page.
It is also possible to continue formatting on the current page
after saving the table away for printing at the top of the
next page, but that will follow.
.sp
An unconditional page eject may be created with the PAGE ".pa"
control word.
.sp
     .pa
     .pa +5
.sp
The first example spaces to the top of the next page.
The second example spaces to the top of the next page and bumps its
page number by five.
The latter may be useful if you intend to insert a section from
a different source.
.si REF$ UNDERSCORING and OVERLAYING;.*********************************
The best way to do underscoring is to use the UNDERSCORE
control word ".us", which causes non-special characters in following
lines of text to be overstruck with a user specifiable character.
Underscoring can be a nuisance with most text editors;
.us the backspace always confuses the issue needlessly.
.sp
     .cp 4;.us UNDERLINING TITLES
.sp
Note that multiple SCRIPT commands may appear on one input
line provided each command is terminated by a semi-colon ";".
In this example the conditional page control word ".cp" was used
to prevent the title from appearing alone at the bottom of a page.
The ".us" overlays each non-punctuation character with underscore.
The ".ud" defines which characters should be affected.
.sp
     .ud OFF *;.us *** ERROR_IN_LINE ***
.sp
This example overstrikes the text line operand with "_" except
"_" itself and "*" defined by ".ud" UNDERSCORE DEFINITION.
.sp
.ud OFF *;.us     *** ERROR_IN_LINE ***;.ud
.sp
.ur .in 3 0-&SYSLL+57
.oo begin
->                                                        <-
OUTPUT OVERLAY ".oo" patterns accomplish special effects by
replacing blanks in fixed output columns by an output pattern.
The pointed arrows surrounding this section were done by the
following sequence:
.sp
     .oo begin
     ->                           <-
     text ...
     ...
     .oo end
.br
.oo end
.sp
     .oo 1 Section
     .oo 1  Number
     .oo 1     One
     .in 10
.sp
.ll;.oo 1 Section;.oo 1  Number;.oo 1     One;.ur .in 10 0-&SYSLL+57
This example with a section title appearing to the left was
done by putting the output overlay elements into a FIFO
(first in, first out)
queue, each entry to be used only one time,
as indicated by the "1" following the ".oo" control word.
.in
.si REF$ FOOTNOTES and REMOTES;.***************************************
Many documents require the use of footnotes.  These footnotes
may be placed in line with the text to which the footnote refers.
These are collected and placed at the bottom of the same*
.fn begin
.of 3
*  It is possible that some or all of the footnote may spill onto
the next page or for the line containing the reference to
get pushed over.
.fn end
page.
.sp
     at the bottom of the same*
     .fn begin
     .of 3
     *  It is possible that some or all of the
     footnote may spill onto the next page or
     for the line containing the reference to get
     pushed over.
     .fn end
     page.
.sp
The ".fn
All text and SCRIPT commands are considered part of the
footnote until the ".fn
.sp
A REMOTE is a sequence of SCRIPT control words and text delimited
with ".rm" control words.  These input lines are saved in memory
to be triggered when a specified output line number is
next encountered.
.sp;.cp 11
     .rm 10 save
     .fo no;.sp
     ---------------
     × A × A' × A" ×
     × B × B' × B" ×
     × C × C' × C" ×
     ---------------
       Figure One
     .sp;.fo yes
     .rm end
.sp
This example shows a small table being saved away to be
triggered at the next output line ten on a page.
If the line number specified were greater than the page
length then it would never be triggered automatically but it could
be SIGNALLED ".si" like an internal subroutine.
.sp
Much more can be done with Remotes but now is not the time and this
is not the place.
.si REF$ SET REFERENCE and SUBSTITUTE REFERENCE;.**********************
The following two sections are most useful to the management
of a large document.
The beginning user may confidently skip to the "WRAPUP"
section, knowing that no basic concepts have not been
covered.
.sp;.cp 10
.in +12
       .*.
     .*   *.
   .*       *.  YES
  *.Beginner?.*-----> "WRAPUP"
    *.     .*
      *. .*
        *
        × NO
        V
.in -12
.sp
While formatting, you may define arithmetic or character string
values for SET REFERENCE variables with the ".se" control word.
.sp;.cp 3
     .se I=&I+1
     .se C='string'
.sp
The first example bumps the numeric variable "I" by one and the
second defines a character string value for variable "C".
A variable name consists of up to ten alphanumeric characters.
A variable may optionally be subscripted from (-32767) to (+32767).
The percent sign "%" may be used as a term in an arithmetic statement;
it is replaced with the current page number.
.sp
System variable symbols like &SYSYEAR and &SYSMONTH are maintained
to make it possible to get at system information that may be useful
in formatting a document.
The following example is constructed from system variable symbols:
.sp
.ur     Today is &SYSPDAYOFW &SYSPMONTH &SYSDAYOFM., &SYSPYEAR
.ur at &SYSHOUR.:&SYSMINUTE.:&SYSSECOND..
.sp
The SUBSTITUTE REFERENCE control word ".su" may be used to replace
occurrences of "&variable" or "&variable." in text and command lines
with the current value of "variable".  A TWOPASS option may be used to
back substitute defined values for variables on the second pass
to enter actual page numbers in a table of contents, for example.
.sp;.cp 14
     .se I=%
     .se J=&J+1
     .se C(1)='Figure'
     .se C(2) = 'One'
     .su on
     &C(1) &C(2) ....... &I
     .br
     This is figure &J..
     .su off
.sp
Produces:
.sp
.se I=%
.se J = 0
.se J=&J+1
.se C(1)='Figure'
.se C(2) = 'One'
.su on
     &C(1) &C(2) ....... &I
.br
     This is figure &J..
.su off
.si REF$ SOURCE SWITCHING;.********************************************
From within a SCRIPT source file you may transfer to another
file for subsequent input and return, as in a subroutine call,
by using the IMBED control word ".im".
Alternatively with an APPEND control word ".ap", SCRIPT
will immediately terminate the current file and next read the
appended file.
.sp;.cp 4
     .im CHAP1
     .im CHAP2
     .im CHAP3
.sp
By maintaining the small driver routine above,
the three chapters of a document may be maintained as three
separate files.  Moreover the first file "CHAP1" could
consist of the following:
.sp;.cp 3
     .im SECT1 Section One
     .im SECT2 Section Two
.sp
This would imbed two more files in turn into the source stream.
The two positional parameters following the file name are
set to Set Reference variables &1 and &2 with &0 being set to
the count of 2.  Thus if SECT1 started as follows:
.sp;.cp 4
     .pa
     .su on;.us &1 &2 - TITLE
     .su off;.sp
.sp
The result would be that the section name would be independent
of the section body.  In fact entire tables of contents
can be built up as each chapter, section, subsection and figure
is imbedded into the manual.
.si REF$ WRAPUP;.******************************************************
Now that you're this far, consider that the introductory portion
is finished.  The sections that follow are all for reference
only and don't require more than a quick review at this point.
There is a section on the invocation parameters accepted by SCRIPT,
one on the physical layout of a formatted SCRIPT page and
two on all the commands, one by function and one alphabetic.
.sp;.cp 4
If you need more information, then run the following job:
.sp
     //SCRIPTMN  JOB  '#,TIME=2,PAGES=200,FORMS=5200'
     //     EXEC     SCRIPTMN
.sp
Then if you need help, contact User Services and they will
help you or direct you to someone who can.
