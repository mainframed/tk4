.SUBT Usage
When SCRIPT encounters an END OF FILE control word in a file
that is being imbedded, the imbedded file is terminated and
the higher level file is resumed.
Similarly, a Remote containing this control word will be terminated,
returning to the next higher level file.
When SCRIPT encounters an
END OF FILE control word in a file that is not imbedded, the
output advances to the top of the next page and prints any
stacked footnotes or text created by ".CP or .FK begin/end"
sequences before termination of all processing.
.SUBT Defaults
This command does not create a break.
