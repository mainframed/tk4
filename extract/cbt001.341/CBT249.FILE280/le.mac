.SUBT Usage
Blank lines may occasionally be the first lines of formatted output
to be printed on a page.  For example, a ".SP
may have appeared five lines from the bottom of the previous
page.  SCRIPT does not normally print such
.FNADD
.ur blank lines&LP..
.fn begin
.in
.ur .of &OFN
.ur (&NFN.) Except at the top of the first page of output.
.fn end
.sp
Since blank lines may sometimes be desirable at the beginning of a
.FNADD
.ur page&LP
.fn begin
.in
.ur .of &OFN
.ur (&NFN.) For example, when centering a figure on a page.
.fn end
the .LE control is provided.
.sp
".LE
".LE
This is true even if the spaces occur within a text block
such as a Conditional Page (.CP) or Floating Keep (.FK).

in effect until ".LE
