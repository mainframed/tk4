.SUBT Usage
When the .TE control word is encountered, the typeball is jiggled,
the user's terminal keyboard is unlocked,
and "n" lines are accepted and processed as if they had been in the
input file.  The lines thus input may be text or control information.
.SUBT Defaults
The ".te" control word does not act as a break in itself.  However,
control
words input under its control _m_a_y act as
breaks.  If the operand is omitted
then _n

(1) If output is being placed on the online terminal, the typing
element will space but not

.ur print&LP..
.fn begin

.ur .of &OFN
.ur (&NFN.) The typing element _w_i_l_l print during the first pass
of a TWOPASS run even if output is online.

The user
should manually space the carriage _b_a_c_k one line to leave it
properly aligned after the carriage return which
ends the input line.

(2) A completely null line is taken to mean that the user is done
typing input lines.  The .TE is terminated regardless of whether "n"
lines have been input.  A null line signals an End Of File.

(3) The user might wish to use .TE in order to dynamically specify
control words or text, or change the typeball.
