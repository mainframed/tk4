.SUBT Usage
The .RV control word verifies that the "name" operand is a
valid reference name.
If it is then one line of data is read from the terminal and
this line is used as the right hand operand of a SET
REFERENCE (.SR) control line.
.sp
No message is displayed at the terminal indicating a READ
VARIABLE is being done.
This may be done with a TYPE ON TERMINAL (.TY) control word
preceeding the .RV.
.SUBT Defaults
This command word does not create a break.
