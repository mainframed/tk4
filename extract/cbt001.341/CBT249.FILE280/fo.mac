.SUBT Purpose
The FORMAT control word combines the effect of CONCATENATE and JUSTIFY.
.SUBT Format
×                <Y_E_S_×NO
×  .FO            LEFT×RIGHT×CENTRE
×                 INSIDE×OUTSIDE×HALF>
.SUBT Usage
The FORMAT control word is a short-hand way to specify CONCATENATE
and JUSTIFY.  This control word specifies
that output lines are to be formed by shifting words to or from the
next line (concatenate) and padded with
extra blanks to produce an even right margin (justify).
.sp
The "NO" operand is equivalent to the control words CONCATENATE NO
and JUSTIFY NO.
The other possible operands specify CONCATENATE and the appropriate
mode of JUSTIFY.
.SUBT Defaults
This command creates a break.
It is in effect unless a ".FO
An omitted operand is treated as "YES".
.SUBT Notes
.of 4
(1) Since FORMAT is the normal mode, the control word is used only to
cancel a previous FORMAT NO control word.
.of 4
(2) The .FI and .NF control words are provided as aliases for
compatibility with FILL and NO FILL in other text formatters.
FILL performs and functions the same as .FO.
