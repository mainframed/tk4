*   THE IPS CONTROLS WHEN THESE WORKLOADS APPEAR IN THEIR RESPECTIVE  *
*   DOMAINS BY SPECIFYING MULTI-PERIOD PERFORMANCE GROUPS.  THE FIRST *
*   PERIOD SPECIFIES A DOMAIN DIFFERENT FROM THE FINAL, DESIRED DOMAIN*
*   THE SECOND PERIOD SPECIFIES THE DOMAIN (ABOVE) WHICH WILL GIVE    *
*   ACCESS TO THE DRUM.  THIS TECHNIQUE PERMITS THE SPECIFIC ONLINE   *
*   WORKLOAD TO COMPLETE SOME PORTION OF ITS INITIALIZATION PROCESS,  *
*   DURING WHICH PAGE OUTS OF UNDESIRED PAGES GO   TO THE             *
*   LOW-PERFORMANCE PAGING DEVICES.  THERE IS SOME RISK FROM          *
*   REENTRANT CODE BEING PAGED OUT DURING THE INITIALIZATION PERIOD:  *
*   ONCE A PAGE CONTAINING REENTRANT CODE CHOOSES A PAGING DEVICE,    *
*   THERE IS NO OPPORTUNITY FOR THAT PAGE TO MIGRATE TO A DIFFERENT   *
*   (POSSIBLY BETTER-PERFORMING) PAGING DEVICE IF THE PAGE IS SUBSE-  *
*   QUENTLY FREQUENTLY ACCESSED.                                      *
*                                                                     *
*   THE TECHNIQUE OF MULTI-PERIOD PERFORMANCE GROUPS TO SWITCH DOMAINS*
*   DOES NOT WORK IF THE ASSOCIATED ADDRESS SPACE HAS BEEN MADE       *
*   NON-SWAPPABLE (VIA MVS PPT OR SYSEVENT DONTSWAP).  IN SUCH CASES, *
*   THE ADDRESS SPACE WILL NOT MIGRATE OUT OF PERIOD 1 TO PERIOD 2,   *
*   SINCE THE NON-SWAPPABLE STATUS OF THE ADDRESS SPACE DISABLES      *
*   MOST SRM CONTROL OF THE ADDRESS SPACE.  THE SOLUTION INVOLVES     *
*   SWITCHING THE IPS AFTER ALL PREFERRED ADDRESS SPACES HAVE         *
*   INITIALIZED WHERE THE NEW IPS SPECIFIES A DIFFERENT DOMAIN NUMBER *
*   FOR THE PREFERRED ADDRESS SPACE  PERFORMANCE GROUPS.              *
*                                                                     *
