 DESCRIPTION OF CONTENTS:

 ICFDUMP
        SINCE AN ICF CATALOG CAN BE READ ONLY BY AN AUTHORIZED PROGRAM
        (AMS WILL NOT REPRO AN ICFCAT), A UTILITY PROGRAM IS SUPPLIED
        TO DUMP THE ICFCAT TO A VBS DATASET WHICH CAN BE PROCESSED BY
        SAS.  THE LOAD MODULE FOR ICFDUMP IS IN FILE 123.

 ICFLIST
        A SAS PROGRAM TO LIST NONVSAM AND GDGBASE ENTRIES FROM AN
        ICF CATALOG.  IT IS INTENDED FOR USE WITH ICFCATS WHICH ARE
        CONVERTED CVOLS.

 ICFJCL
        SAMPLE JCL TO RUN ICFDUMP AND ICFLIST
