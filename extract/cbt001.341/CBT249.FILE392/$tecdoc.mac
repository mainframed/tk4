  This  version of the QUEUE command is a highly modified copy from the
  MODS  tape  version  12 - 24 May 1983.  It will run against JES2 SP1.3
  spool and checkpoint datasets.

  I started with the good intentions of making this a "GEN" option as ot
  ers have. However, as usual I ran out of time and started trying to ma
  it work. I hope to have time to go back and do a cleaner job of this.

  Not  being a JES2 wizard, I made an educated guess as to which queues
  search  when.  I  will definitely go back and clean this up. In any ca
  the command works in normal situations.

  Here is a brief description of the major changes.

  General   All  control blocks for JES2 modules are now supported throu
            a  macro  called $MODULE. A minor mod needs to be made to th
            IBM macro for QUEUE to assemble.  See member "$MODX".

  QSTART    The  macro  QSTART  was changed to call $MODULE with a list
            the control blocks needed.

  CJOE      Since  there  is  no  longer  a checkpoint JOE this module w
            changed  to read the $CHK spool record (If work-JOE says it
            valid.

  CKPT      Since  the  checkpoint master record is now (in our shop) mo
            than '4096' long, a minor  change was needed to correctly re
            following records.

  CPDDB     Each IOT now contains the offset to the first PDDB.  Therefo
            this field is used instead of the QCOMMON field.

  DDNAME    Same as CPDDB.

  FINDJOB   Added  code  to  use the JIX record to quickly locate a job
            number instead of searching JQE chains.  Modified search tec
            nique  to  new queueing structure.  Added table of JQE and J
            queue head offsets. Need to add more queues to the search.

  FINDPDDB  Now uses new PDDB pointer in IOT.

  FORMAT    Now  uses  new  $CHK  spool  record instead of checkpoint JO
            Need to add more queue names to the literal formating.

  INIT      Probably  the most modified.  Uses KIT (checkpoint informati
            table)  at  end  of master checkpoint record to get number a


¯

            offset  of  various kinds of checkpoint information.  Uses D
            to  allocate  and open spool volumes.  (Since we run with on
            one  spool  volume,  I  don't  know  if  this  code  works f
            multi-volume spool.)

  JLOG      Now uses new PDDB pointer in IOT.

  LISTDS    Now uses new PDDB pointer in IOT.

  REPOS     Now requires a model number when entered for the terminal mo
            el change command.

  SEARCH    Changed  fairly  heavily for new queue structure.  It works
            normal  cases  but,  I  need to review which queues need to
            searched for each of the commands.

  Most  of  the  changes discussed above are not marked in the code as y
  (sorry). I will try to get a cleaner copy out.
