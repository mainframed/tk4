* * * * * * * *    ENTERPRISE MOVEMENT    (COMMAND 1)    * * * * * * * *

  This is how you move the ENTERPRISE from one place to another.
     If you do a short range scan (2), you will notice that you are
     somewhere in a ten by ten matrix that shows the contents of the
     quadrant you are in. The distance between points on the short
     range scan is 1 parsec.  At a speed of warp 1 you will be
     travelling at the rate of 1 parsec/starminute.  A starminute in
     real time will be the number of seconds printed out as the timing
     factor at the start above.
     To choose the proper bearing, keep the following points in mind:
     1. 90 degress is straight up.
     2. 180 degrees is to the left.
     3. Bearings outside the 0-360 range will be automatically
        readjusted.
     4. Acceleration and deceleration are at the rate of .25 P/SM/SM.
     5. The ship's position in the quadrant you are in is such that
        0 degrees is the direction of increasing X values and
        90 degrees is the direction of increasing Y values for
        coordinates.
     6. At speeds of WARP 1 and higher, the only mishap that can occur
        is running off the edge of the galactic sector. no collisions!
        However, you can only engage the enemy at speeds below 1.
     7. When you leave a quadrant, the following things happen:
        A. Anything you left behind (shuttlecraft, troops, etc.) is
           deleted.
        B. Enemy vessels and starbases left behind return to their
           original, undamaged state(unless they were destroyed).
           Note that this means that enemy vessels that you
           captured and didn't destroy will be recaptured by the enemy!
        C. If you reenter the quadrant later, do not expect objects to
           be in the same place you left them.  A ghostship may or
           may not still be there.
     8. Finally, acceleration uses energy, so conserve it!
     9. When you reach your desired speed and bearing, your engines shut
        down.  The effects are:
        A. If there is a black hole in the quadrant, you will accelerate
           towards it (and speed up or slow down depending on your final
           course), but your changes in speed will not be reported or
           corrected.
        B. If your warp and or impulse drives are damaged, you don't
           slow down but continue to drift at your present speed (this
           means that if you are moving, and both drives are damaged,
           there is no way you can stop short of a collision or
           leaving the galaxy).

* * * * * * * *    SHORT RANGE SCAN    (COMMAND 2)    * * * * * * * * *

  The short range scan tells you about the quadrant you are presently
     occupying. X coordinates increase to the right (bearing: 0) and Y
     coordinates to the top (bearing: 90).  Each object in the quadrant
     is abbreviated by a letter and may be followed by a number to
     distinguish it from other objects of the same type.
     Abbreviations are:
     E - ENTERPRISE
     G - GHOST
     K - KLINGON
     R - ROMULAN
     S - SHUTTLECRAFT
     T - TORPEDO
     * - STAR
     . - EMPTY SPACE
       - BLACK HOLE.
     When two or more objects occupy approximate positions, only one
     will be shown.  Although all objects are displayed on integral
     coordinates, only a short range track (15) can tell you the exact
     position of moving objects.  For most purposes, though, the
     difference will not be significant.

* * * * * * * * *    LONG RANGE SCAN    (COMMAND 3)    * * * * * * * * *

  The long range scan tells you what is in yours and the immediately
     surrounding quadrants.  Each quadrant is described by a four digit
     number:
     1. 1's place - The number of stars in the quadrant.
     2. 10's place - The number of starbases in the quadrant.
     3. 100's place - The number of Klingons in the quadrant.
     4. 1000's place - The number of Romulans in the quadrant.
     Your quadrant is the one in the center of the long range scan
     (unless you are on the edge of the galactic sector, in which
     case a galactic update (16) will show your position.)

* * * * * * * * * * *    PHASERS    (COMMAND 4)    * * * * * * * * * * *

  Phasers fire along the axis of the ship, either FWD or REAR
     (present brng+180 deg.).  Their strength attenuates with distance
     and bearing away from the direction fired.  Unit effectiveness
     (where 100 units of energy will produce a 100 unit hit)
     occurs at a distance of 2.24 parsecs (and directly in line with
     your present bearing.  Phasers act instantaneously against all
     targets in their path.

* * * * * * * *    PHOTON TORPEDOES    (COMMAND 5)    * * * * * * * * *

  Photon torpedoes will destroy whatever they hit execpt starbases,
     shuttlecraft, black holes, nucleonic storms, and the ENTERPRISE.
     Your torps are fired with a velocity of .4 P/SM in the direction
     you give if the ship is not moving, but if it is moving, their
     velocity will be the vector sum of your velocity and the velocity
     they would have if your were not moving.  Torps levaing the
     quadrant are destroyed.
  If you are hit by a photon torpedo, the strength of the hit will
     depend on how close the torp was when it detonated (this can
     range from 75 to 175).  Torpedos cannot be accidentally detonated
     by the vessel which fired them, so you don't have to worry about
     running into your own torpedos.  Shuttlecraft and starbases
     are unaffected by torpedos (a torp can be fired right through the
     position a shuttlecraft occupies, but will explode harmlessly
     when striking a starbase).

* * * * * * * * *    PULSIVE BEAMS    (COMMAND 6)    * * * * * * * * * *

  Pulsive beams serve two purposes. Either to pull in a ghostship,
     or to push away a Klingon.  In the former case, you will be docked
     with the ghostship if your shields are down (otherwise there will
     be a collision!) and the ghostship will be destroyed, while in the
     latter case, the Klingon will be pushed away a distance dependent
     on the amount of energy you expended.  150 units of energy at a
     distance of 2 parsecs will move a Klingon 1 parsec farther away.
     Energy required increases with the square of distance.

* * * * * * * * * * *    TRAVEL    (COMMAND 7)    * * * * * * * * * * *

  This command is useful for waiting for things to happen.  It causes
     the game to proceed with normal activities (E.G. - damage repair,
     movement, shuttlecraft exploration) without interrupting you for
     commands for the specified number of starminutes.

* * * * * * * * *    STATUS REPORT    (COMMAND 8)    * * * * * * * * * *

  This command provides information about the ship's present status
     such as course, torpedos left, and technological improvements found
     to date.

* * * * * * * * *    DAMAGE REPORT    (COMMAND 9)    * * * * * * * * * *

  You may assign damage control personnel with this command, or list
     extent of damage suffered + any fatalities.  The time it will take
     your crew to repair the damage is given in stardays.  If a truce
     is in effect, it will take only 1/3 as long.  A starbase may have
     replacements for your crew and troops, in addition to being able
     to repair your damage quicker than your crew could.

* * * * * *    EVASIVE MANEUVERS    (COMMAND 10 AND 11)    * * * * * * *

  Evasive maneuvers are used for changing bearing instantaneously.
     They use 200 units of energy if P or S, and use 300 units if R.
     If your warp drive is damaged, these amounts will be 500 and 750
     units respectively.  You cannot do emergency evasive maneuvers
     if your warp drive is damaged.  The desired speed is set to .55
     for evasive maneuvers or 1.1 if emergency evasive maneuvers.
     Port is left (+90 DEGREES) and starboard is right (-90 DEGREES).

* * * * * * * *    RAISE DEFLECTORS    (COMMAND 12)    * * * * * * * * *

  Raising your deflectors is very important as it prevents you from
     sustaining damage in battle.  A good amount to put in is 1/3 of
     your total energy.  If you should need it later on, you can get
     it back with a 13 command or only part of it with a 12 command
     and a negative number.

* * * * * * * *    LOWER DEFLECTORS    (COMMAND 13)    * * * * * * * * *

  This returns any energy in your shields to the ship's energy banks.
     Energy in the ship's energy banks is used for maneuvering,
     evasive actions, phasers, pulsive beams, and life support.
     If this amount falls to zero, the game is ended unless there is
     still energy in your deflectors, in this case your deflectors are
     automatically dropped and the energy returned to the energy banks.

* * * * * * * *    PROPOSE TRUCE    (COMMAND 14)    * * * * * * * * * *

  You may propose a truce only to enemy vessels in your quadrant.  It
     will be accepted only if the enemy is badly damaged.  A truce stops
     all activities except damage repair and shuttlecraft exploration
     until you break it, which you can do by issuing a 1, 4, 5,
     6 (repulsor), 10, 11, or 19 (only if to an enemy vessel) command.
     The enemy will not accept a truce if you have troops on board an
     uncaptured enemy vessel (I.E. - if there is still fighting going
     on).

* * * * * * *    SHORT RANGE TRACK    (COMMAND 15)    * * * * * * * * *

  A short range track gives you the position and speed and heading
     of the ENTERPRISE + any Klingons,Torpedos,or ghostships in the
     quadrant.  Torps fired by the enterprise (and by captured Romulans)
     will have negative beraings - add 360 to get the actual bearing.
     Torps fired by ghostships will have bearings in the 360-720 range -
     subtract 360 to get the actual bearing.

* * * * * * * *    GALACTIC UPDATE    (COMMAND 16)    * * * * * * * * *

  This displays the entire galactic sector, but only shows information
     on quadrants that you have seen.  Interpret it the same way as the{
     long range scan.  A -1 means you haven't seen that quadrant.  Note
     that this displays the contents of the quadrants as last seen by
     you with a long or short range scan, not as they are now.  The
     enemy will be moving from quadrant to quadrant regardless of where
     you are fighting, but stars and starbases will not.

* * * * * * * * *    PLOT BEARING    (COMMAND 17)    * * * * * * * * * *

  This gives the bearing, radius, and distance from the ENTERPRISE of
     non-moving objects (except enemy vessels) if you are below warp 1.
     If in hyperspace, plot bearing tells you which quadrants contain
     starbases, and black holes if you been in the quadrants that
     contain holes.  Stars have variable radii ranging from .25 to .99
     parsec.  Bases have a radius of .7 parsec.

* * * * * * * * *    SELF DESTRUCT    (COMMAND 18)    * * * * * * * * *

  To be used only in direst emergency.  It ends the game while
     destroying anything in the quadrant you are in.  The code word is
     your password.

* * * * * * * * *    TRANSPORTERS    (COMMAND 19)    * * * * * * * * * *

  Transporters are used to beam troops (not crew) from one place to
     another.  You can beam them aboard enemy vessels in an attempt to
     capture them, or aboard ghostships to activate their weapons,
     or from starbases to supplement your own troops (+ other
     possibilities).  It costs energy to transport troops from one place
     to another energy used = men beamed * 0.1 * distance (in parsecs)
     beamed.

* * * * * * * * *    COMMUNICATIONS    (COMMAND 20)    * * * * * * * * *

  This command is used to communicate with ghostships, starbases,
     or enemy vessels you have captured with your troops.  You can
     instruct them to fire their weapons, report on damage or status,
     raise deflectors (ghostship only), change course, self destruct,
     or, in the case of bases, plot bearings.

* * * * * * * * *    SHUTTLECRAFT    (COMMAND 21)    * * * * * * * * * *

  Shuttlecraft are used solely for exploring star systems within a
     quadrant.  They are the only vessels which can approach a star
     without being destroyed.  On return from their exploratory
     missions, you will be informed of their findings, which may range
     from virulent diseases which will decimate your crew, to
     technological improvements which will increase your fighting
     capability.  You have 2 shuttlecraft, but only 1 may be used at a
     time.  A starbase may have a replacement for one of them if you
     are lucky.

* * * * * * * * * *    COMPUTER    (COMMAND 22)    * * * * * * * * * * *

  The ship's computer can tell you such things as the amount of time it
     will take a shuttlecraft to complete its mission, the amount of
     energy it will take to pull in a ghostship at this distance, where
     a black hole in the quadrant will take you if you are captured by
     it, or the current ranks of all starship captains.

* * * * * * * * *    AUTOPILOT    (COMMAND 23)    * * * * * * * * * * *

  This command not implemented yet.

* * * * * * * *    CALCULATE ORBIT    (COMMAND 24)    * * * * * * * * *

  This command not implemented yet.

* * * * * * * * * *    BEARING    (COMMAND 1.1)    * * * * * * * * * * *

  Enter a number in the 0-360 range indicating the bearing in degrees
     you desire to travel.  Course changes occur at the rate of
     45 DEG/SM (20 DEG/SM when using impulse drive).  The ENTERPRISE
     will turn in the direction of the shortest arc between the present
     bearing and the desired bearing.  Remember that a change in bearing
     while moving consumes energy just as a change in speed would.  Your
     present bearing is given in parentheses.

* * * * * * * * * *    SPEED    (COMMAND 1.2)    * * * * * * * * * * * *

  Enter your desired speed (it will be in parsecs per starminute).
     Acceleration is at the rate of .25 P/SM/SM (.1 P/SM/SM if using
     impulse drive).  At speeds of warp 1 and higher you are in
     hyperspace and will not collide with objects.  Certain commands are
     impossible when in hyperspace, these are 2,4,5,6,10,11,14,15,19,20,
     21, and 22 commands.  Travelling faster than warp 3 is dangerous as
     you may not be able to decelerate in time to avoid leaving the
     galaxy.  Maximum docking speed with a starbase is .2 P/SM.  Your
     present speed is given in parentheses.

* * * * * * * * *    DIRECTION    (COMMAND 4.1)    * * * * * * * * * * *

  Type "F" for forward, "R" for rear.  Phasers are most effective along
     the axis the ship is pointed (either forward or rear), but your
     two phaser banks can cover all 360 degrees.  If the enemy you are
     firing at is behind some other object, such as a star or another
     enemy, that enemy will be shielded from your fire to some extent.

* * * * * * * *    ENERGY AMOUNT    (COMMAND 4.2)    * * * * * * * * * *

  Energy for phasers is drawn from the ship's energy banks (the amount
     available is shown in parens).  Energy in your deflectors is not
     available unless you first do a 12 or 13 command.  It takes a 300
     unit hit to destroy a Klingon, and a 400 unit hit for a Romulan.
     It may take more if you don't get him with your first shot as he
     will be repairing the damage in the interim.  Your phasers are also
     causing casualties to his crew (which are not replaces as long
     as you are in the same quadrant), and if you have troops on board
     fighting, they may be affected by your fire also.  Once you have
     captured an enemy vessel, however, your phasers can't harm it.

* * * * * * * *    TORPEDO NUMBER    (COMMAND 5.1)    * * * * * * * * *

  You may fire any number of torpedos in one command up to the number
     you have on board.  However, torps are fired at the rate of 1 per
     starminute, (unless improved by exploring), not all simultaneously.
     if the resultant velocity of a torpedo (vector sub of torp veloctiy
     and ship's velocity) is warp 1 or higher, the torp "dissappears"
     into hyperspace.

* * * * * * * *    TORPEDO BEARING    (COMMAND 5.2)    * * * * * * * * *

  Bearing must be in the range 0-359 degrees.  Don't forget to take into
     account the ship's velocity.  For example, if you are traveling at
     warp .4 at 30 deg. and fire a torp with a given bearing of 0 deg.,
     the actual bearing of the torp will be 15 deg. (unless torp speed
     increased by exploring).

* * * * * * * * *    BEAM TYPE    (COMMAND 6.1)    * * * * * * * * * * *

  Tractor (T) beams act only on ghostships and are the sole means of
     docking with them and transferring their energy and torps (if any)
     to the ENTERPRISE.  Your shields must be down when docking or a
     collision will result.  Since the energy required to bring in the
     ghostship is calculated automatically, be careful of trying to dock
     with distant ghostships as the amount of energy required varies as
     the square of the distance.  For example, 100 units of energy will
     be required at a distance of 2 parsecs, but 1600 will be required
     at a distance of 8 parsecs.  A 22 command can tell you how much
     energy exactly it will take to pull in a ghostship.
  Repulsor (R) beams act only on the Klingon you specify and will push
     it away along the line between you and it.

* * * * * * * *    ENERGY AMOUNT    (COMMAND 6.2)    * * * * * * * * * *

  The distance the Klingon will be moved depends on the amount of energy
     you expend and its present distance from you.  If you plan things
     right, you can push him into a star or out of the galaxy.

* * * * * * * *    KLINGON TO MOVE    (COMMAND 6.3)    * * * * * * * * *

  If there is more than one Klingon in the quadrant for your pulsive
     beams to lock onto, you must select one of them.  This condition
     arises even if there is only one Klingon left and there used to be
     more but they were destroyed.  The number should correspond to the
     number of the Klingon on your scan that you want to repulse.

* * * * * * * * *    TRAVEL TIME    (COMMAND 7.1)    * * * * * * * * * *

  This merely speeds up the computer's internal clock so that the number
     of starminutes you specify will pass in the normal number of
     starminutes between commands.  Can be dangerous to use when you are
     moving, as you won't be able to do anything else for that number of
     starminutes.

* * * * * * * *    DAMAGE CONTROL    (COMMAND 9.1)    * * * * * * * * *

  The two possibilities are "R" for report and "P" for reassignment of
     damage control crews.

* * * * * * * *    DAMAGE REPAIR    (COMMAND 9.2)    * * * * * * * * * *

  By assigning a percentage of your crew to repairing specific damage,
     you can speed up or slow down the rate of repair of that damage.
     You should enter up to 10 integers, separated by commas and
     terminated by a slash, which should sum to <= 100.  The positions
     of the integers in the input string correspond to the numbers of
     the damaged items.
     For instance, if phasers, sr scan, and w drive are all damaged,
     to repair only w drave and sr scan type 50,,,,,50/ (this would
     assign 50 % of your repair crews to each item).  To repair sr scan
     only, type ,,,,,,100/.  If only one item is damaged, you don't have
     to assign damage control personnel, as any unassigned personnel
     (or those assigned to non-damaged items) are automatically
     reassigned equally to damaged items.  For instance, if your
     priorities are 10,20,30,40,0,0,0,0,0,0 and w drive and sr scan are
     damaged, 55 % will be assigned to w drive and 45 % to sr scan.  If
     w drive and phasers were damaged 40 % would be assigned to w drive
     and 60 % to phasers.

* * * * * *    DAMAGE REPAIR AT BASES    (COMMAND 9.3)    * * * * * * *

  Enter the numbers of the items you want repaired separated by commas
     and terminated by a slash.  If you want none repaired, type "-1/".
     repair rate is 3-10 times faster than if your crew were assigned
     to repair that item.

* * * * *    EMERGENCY MANEUVERS    (COMMAND 10.1 or 11.1)    * * * * *

  Course change is instantaneous by +90, -90, or 180 degrees (P, S, or R
     respectively).  200 - 300 (if command 11 500 - 750) units of energy
     are consumed by this maneuver.  If command 11 is used, your
     acceleration will be temporarily doubled, but it may damage your
     warp drive engines.  If this occurs, you will continue to drift at
     your present speed (1.1).  If both drives are dead, you will
     continue to drift and be unable to come to a stop or change course!

* * * * * * * *    ENERGY AMOUNT    (COMMAND 12.1)    * * * * * * * * *

  A positive number adds energy to your deflectors, while a negative
     number returns that anount to your main energy banks.  If you get
     a condition red when entering a quadrant, better raise your
     deflectors quick!  Warning messages will appear if your defelectors
     are getting low during battle.

* * * * * * * *    SELF DESTRUCT    (COMMAND 18.1)    * * * * * * * * *

  The code word required to initiate the auto-destruct sequence is your
     password.  Once started, this sequence can't be interrupted by any
     means!

* * * * * * * *    TRANSPORT FROM    (COMMAND 19.1)    * * * * * * * * *

  Valid "from" designations are: E, B, G, K, and R.  G, R, and K can be
     used only if you have at some point beamed troops over to them.
     A starbase may or may not have additional troops for you.  If you
     type K or R you must follow it with its number as shown on your
     short range scan.

* * * * * * * *    TRANSPORT RATE    (COMMAND 19.2)    * * * * * * * * *

  Transport rate is 40 troops/starminute (unless increased by exploring)
     The more men you send over to an enemy vessel, the better chance
     you have of capturing it with fewer casualties.  Size of crew on
     enemy vessels can range from 75 to 200 and at odds of less than 1-1
     you will probably not capture it.  Once you have captured it, it
     will respond to your commands via a 20 command, but the speed of
     response will depend on how many men you have on board at the time.

* * * * * * * *    TRANSPORT TO    (COMMAND 19.3)    * * * * * * * * * *

  Valid "to" designations are E, G, K, or R.  In the case of K or R
     destination, you must follow the letter by the number to tell which
     vessel to use (even if there is only one in the quadrant).  If the
     vessel you have troops on leaves the quadrant or is destroyed, the
     troops on board are lost also.

* * * * * * *    CLOAKING DEVICE    (COMMAND 19.4)    * * * * * * * * *

  You must guess the X and Y coordinates of a Romulan using the
     cloaking device. He is invisible to your short range sensors.
     If you guess correctly and capture him in the subsequent battle,
     you will also capture the cloaking device.  Enter 2 integers
     separated by a comma.

* * * * * * * *    COMMUNICATIONS    (COMMAND 20.1)    * * * * * * * * *

  You can attempt to communicate with B, G, K, or R.  In the latter two
     cases, follow the letter designation with the appropriate number.
     If there are other enemy vessels in the quadrant, your message may
     be intercepted or jammed.  You can only communicate with ghostships
     or vessels you have captured with your troops.

* * * * * * * * *    MESSAGES    (COMMAND 20.2)    * * * * * * * * * * *

  The following matrix shows the possible messages:
     K - status report, damage report, fire phaser, change course,
         self destruct
     R - status report, damage report, fire torpedos, self destruct
     G - status report, damage report, fire phasers, fire torpedos,
         change course, raise or lower deflectors, self destruct
     B - status report, plot bearing
  Ghostships have only the forward phaser bank, and will fire with 100
     units of energy (if they have that much left).  Klingons have 4
     phaser banks and will fire all 4 at once against any other K or R
     (non-captured) in the quadrant.  Klingons only have to be told to
     fire their phasers once.  They will keep firing every 3 to 5
     starminutes until they are destroyed.  With ghostships, the various
     facilities (phasers, torpedos, deflectors, or impulse drive) may
     be dead, in which case the troops you have beamed over will
     attempt to repair them (repair rate depends on how many men are on
     board).  Note that if you order a vessel to self destruct, this
     will automatically first beam back any of your troops that were
     aboard it.  You will not be able to use your transporters while
     this automatic beam back is occurring (nor can you cancel it), but
     you can order a vessel to self destruct even if your transporters
     are in use at the time.  A message will be printed telling you the
     number of starminutes to destruct.  This command is useful for
     adding captured enemy vessels to your victory total.

* * * * * * * * * *    BEARING    (COMMAND 20.3)    * * * * * * * * * *

  Klingons change course at the rate of 30 deg/sm, ghostships only turn
     at 10 deg/sm.  To get the old bearing, it is necessary to do a
     short range track (15) or get a status report for it.

* * * * * * * * * *    SPEED    (COMMAND 20.4)    * * * * * * * * * * *

  Klingons change speed at .2 P/SM/SM, ghostships at .1 P/SM/SM.
     Maximum speed is .5 for K, .35 for G.  Note that if a captured
     enemy leaves the quadrant, it is immediately recaptured by the
     enemy.  Klingons leaving the galaxy and ghostships leaving the
     quadrant are destroyed.

* * * * * * * * *    TORPEDOS    (COMMAND 20.5)    * * * * * * * * * * *

  Romulan torp velocity is .55 P/SM.  You can fire up to 5 torps with
     one command from Romulans and ghostships.  Input up to 5 bearings
     separated by commas, terminated by a /.  With ghostships, the G
     velocity must also be taken into account.  Ghostship torp velocity
     is .4 P/SM.

* * * * * * * * *    DEFLECTORS    (COMMAND 20.6)    * * * * * * * * * *

  Ghostships can be destroyed by torpedos, collisions, or leaving the
     quadrant.  By raising the deflectors, you may stop the torpedos
     from getting through.  Do a status report (20, then 8) for the
     G first to find out how much energy is available.

* * * * * * *    GHOSTSHIPS PHASERS    (COMMAND 20.7)    * * * * * * * *

  The ghostship will continue to fire phasers up to the number of times
     indicated, or until all it's energy is used up.  A value <= 0
     cancels this order and all previously queued firings.

* * * * * * * *    SHUTTLECRAFT    (COMMAND 21.1)    * * * * * * * * * *

 The two commands are E (explore) and R (return to ENTERPRISE).

* * * * * * * *    EXPLORATION    (COMMAND 21.2)    * * * * * * * * * *

  There may be up to 9 stars in a quadrant.  You may explore them in
     any order.  The numbers of the ones you wish to explore should
     correspond to the numbers of the stars on the short range scan
     and should be separated by commas and terminated by a slash.
     Shuttlecraft velocity is .25 P/SM. It is not necessary to return
     after exploring one star system, but you can explore several with
     one command.  You will not know the results of the exploration
     until it returns.  If the star system is destroyed while the
     shuttlecraft is en route, it will go on to the next unexplored
     star system (or return if there are no more to be explored).
     If the star system is destroyed (E.G. by torp hit or collision)
     while the shuttlecraft is exploring it, the shuttlecraft will
     be destroyed also.

* * * * * * * * *    COMPUTER    (COMMAND 22.1)    * * * * * * * * * * *

  There are six requests you can make of the computer:
     B - tells you where a black hole in the quadrant will take you.
     C - allows you to turn the cloaking device on or off if under
         ENTERPRISE control.
     G - tells you how much energy will be retuired to pull in the
         ghostship.
     R - gives you current rank of all starship captains.
     S - gives you shuttlecraft round trip time for stellar exploration.
     T - gives you the current time.

* * * * * * *    CLOAKING DEVICE    (COMMAND 22.2)    * * * * * * * * *

  The cloaking device when captured can be turned on or off.  If the
     cloaking device is on the ENTERPRISE will not be displayed on a
     short range scan, but Kligons and Romulans will not be able to
     see the ENTERPRISE to fire at it.

* * * * * * * * *    GAME LEVELS    (GENERAL 1)    * * * * * * * * * * *

  There are 3 game levels, numbered 1 to 3.
  Game 1, the beginner's game, has the following limitations:
     1. The enemy will not move between quadrants.
     2. Romulans will not move within a quadrant.
     3. There will never be more than 3 Klingon or 3 Romulan in a
        quadrant.
     4. Klingons are not programmed to dodge your torpedos.
     5. Phasers are not masked by intervening objects.
  Game 2, the basic game, the above limitations are removed.
  Game 3, the advanced game, adds the following features to the
     basic game:
     1. Black holes - G and T entering are destroyed.
        E, K, and R entering are zapped to another quadrant.
        Black holes show up on your short range scan as a blank.
        Black holes have gravitational fields that reach throughout
        the quadrant and affect E,K,G, and T (not Romulans).  You can,
        presumably, go into orbit around one although it is very tricky
        to attempt.  If you are captured by one, it will take you to a
        specific quadrant, thus if you are willing to sustain the
        damage, you can take shortcuts through the galaxy.  Black holes
        mask phaser fire almost entirely.
     2. Supernovae - Every star has a minute chance of going supernova.
        When this occurs, everything in the quadrant is destroyed,
        except the ENTERPRISE, which is badly damaged.  Supernova
        explosions will always damage your SR and LR scans.
     3. Cloaking device - Certain Romulans will have a cloaking device
        which will make them invisible to your short range sensors.
        If you succeed in capturing it, you will become invisible to the
        enemy for a varying period of time!  Use your troops.  Warning -
        its crew strength will be higher than ordinary Romulans.
     4. Nucleonic storms - These will not show up on your sensors at
        all, but if an object enters one, it will be thrown to some
        other point in the quadrant with random speed and bearing.  The
        probability of a storm increases with the number of stars in a
        quadrant. E, G, K, R, S, and T are effected by storms.

* * * * * * * * *    GALAXY SIZE    (GENERAL 2)    * * * * * * * * * * *

  Enter the size in quadrants of the galaxy you wish to fight in.  It
     must be an integer between 2 and 10 inclusive.

* * * * * * * * *    ENEMY VESSELS    (GENERAL 3)    * * * * * * * * * *

  You can specify a lower limit to the number of enemy vessels you will
     be fighting.  The exact number will vary depending on the size of
     the galaxy you are fighting in and the mood the random number
     generator is in.  You will never get more than 99 of each or fewer
     than 1.

* * * * * * * * *    RATING SYSTEM    (GENERAL 4)    * * * * * * * * * *

  Here is how the STAR TREK rating system works:
     TABLE I
             RANK                  POINTS NEEDED

  Notes for table II:
     1 - A win is a score of 750 or higher.  Points gained are on a
         percentage basis of the score divided by 1000.  If you win by
         self destruct, however, you only get half the points.
     2 - A loss is a rating of less than 750.  Points lost are on a
         percentage basis of the score divided by 1000.  Your total
         points cannot fall below 1 after you have become a recruit.
     3 - 1 = BEGINNER GAME, 2 = BASIC GAME, 3 = ADVANCED GAME.
     4 - This is the total # enemy you started out with.  See table III
         for the size of the galaxy to specify to get the required #.
     5 - This is the maximum rank you can achieve by playing at this
         level.  Once you reach this rank, you will not gain points,
         even if you win (but you will lose points if you lose).

  Once you reach the rank of captain, a score of <900 is a loss.  The
     only way to reach the rank of fleet admiral is to win a game
     (rating=1000) vs 198 enemy at level 3 playing at a timing factor of
     10 or less.  Once you do attain this exalted rank, however, you can
     never lose points and may play at any level to gain points.

        GALACTIC SIZE    MAXIMUM ENEMY POSSIBLE
              2                6 (18 AT LEVELS 2 OR 3)

 The minimum you can get at level 1 is 6 and at level 2 or 3 is 18.  Of
    interest to the player is the following table showing, the number
    of starbases you will get depending on other considerations.
