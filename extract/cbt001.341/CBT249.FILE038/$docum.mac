THIS MEMBER DOCUMENTS WHAT IS CONTAINED IN THIS PDS

SMPSEL  - A PROGRAM THAT WE'VE FOUND VERY USEFUL IN APPLYING MAINTENANCE
          TO MVS, ESPECIALLY WITH PUT.  YOU CAN SELECT EVERY SYSMOD IN
          THE PTS THAT IS APPLICABLE TO A PARTICULAR FMID.  THIS CAN
          THEN BE USED TO AUGMENT THE EXCLUDE LIST.

PROGDQUE- A PROGRAM THAT WILL BUILD THE PRINT QUEUE DATASET FOR THE
          TSO/VTAM VERSION OF DSPRINT.  IT REPLACES THE USE OF IEBDG TO
          INITIALIZE THE DATASET.  IT IS MUCH FAST AND EASIER TO USE,
          ESPECIALLY FOR LARGE NUMBERS OF PRINTERS.

SUPRTREK- THIS IS BY FAR, THE MOST ADVANCED VERSION OF A STARTREK GAME
          THAT WE HAVE EVER SEEN.  FEATURES INCLUDE DATABASE FOR USER
          RANKING AND CONTROL, SHUTTLECRAFT EXPLORATION, REAL-TIME
          MOVEMENT (E.G. 10 SEC = 1 STARMINUTE), "SAVE" GAME FACILITY,
          VARIABLE LEVELS OF PLAY, VARIABLE SIZE UNIVERSE, HAND-TO-HAND
          COMBAT, CLOAKING DEVICES, AND OTHERS.  PRINT ST79HELP FOR
          DETAILS OF PLAY.  ST79INST IS INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS.
