0     Many large programming systems are constructed from a large number
      rately assembled or compiled sections.    Such systems must manage
      communications by means of a set of  vector tables and other contr
      that are known to each of the separate sections; which is to say,
      trol blocks  must contain fields that  may be referenced and/or  c
      any or all of the sections.  Accordingly, a global cross-reference
      reporting which sections reference which fields,  is a very useful
      a large-systems developer to have.
0        XREFASM is a relatively simple system  that generates such glob
      reference listings.   Specifically,   XREFASM generates a report
      sorted list  of all labels  used in a given  set of separate  asse
      compilations.   The entries  for each label show both  which assem
      compilations)  reference that  label and how many  references each
      has to that label.  Figure 1 shows a sample XREFASM output.

0     XREFIN accumulates cross-reference data from  individual assemblie
      pilations.  It is designed to be used as follows:
0        ø One-step assembly jobs  should be changed to  two-step jobs c
           of the assembly step followed by the XREFIN step.
0        ø The assembly step should write its listing file to a temporar
           rather than to spool.
0        ø The XREFIN step can then read the listing file and extract fr
           relevant cross-reference information.  In addition, the XREFI
           can echo the listing dataset to a SYSPRINT file, if desired.
0        XREFIN extracts cross-reference data and writes it "mod" to an
      tion dataset which will later be processed by XREFOUT.  Each recor
      is assigned both the  name of the current assembly and  a timestam
      ated with the  current run.   XREFIN infers the assembly  name by
      the page  title lines appearing in  the assembly listing.   The  f
      appearing in the title line is taken to be the assembly name.  For
      S/370 Assembler, Assembler H,  and the Series/1 Assembler,  this f
      is set from the name field of the "TITLE" assembler statement.
0        The timestamp is stored so that later XREFOUT can control the r
      repeated assemblies of the same sections.  If the same section is
      twice and XREFIN is, therefore,  executed twice for the same secti
      two complete sets of cross-reference data  will be written to the
      tion file.   Because of the timestamps, XREFOUT can recognize the
      and discard the older cross-reference data.

+     Purging References to Obselete Assemblies
0     Sometimes it  is desirable  to purge  from the  accumulated cross-
      references to assemblies that that, for one reason or another,  ha
      obselete and have been dropped.   This might  also be necessary if
      on the TITLE card for an assembly  has been changed thus making wh
      is the same assembly module appear to  XREFOUT to be two different
      modules.   To accomplish this purging, the user should place into
      mulation file one or more "purge control records".   These are rec
      start with a blank character (at offset +0)  followed by an assemb
      name (at offset +1 for up to 8 characters).  The remaining 149 byt
      purge control record are ignored.
0        When XREFOUT encounters a purge control record, it will then de

      matches the one given  by the purge record.   Note that  an assemb
      name that is entirely blank is valid.    This corresponds to the c

0        Purge control  records must be put  into an accumulation  file
      They may be placed anywhere in the file since XREFOUT always sorts
      in a way that  moves them to the top.   Any number of  purge recor
      put into the file, and redundant records do not hurt.
0        There are any number of methods of placing purge records into a
      lation file.   They can be edited in assuming  that the file is no
      for the editor being used.  They can be written in with IEBGENER.
      sure to use  DISP=MOD.   Or they can  be placed into a  separate f
      would then be concatenated via JCL to the accumulation file when X
      executed.   Be aware, though, that XREFOUT does not support "unlik
      enation",  thus  the file containing the  purge records must have
      attributes as the accumulation file.
