           × regional or VSAM (key sequenced, entry sequenced or relativ
           × record).  There are no restrictions on record format (RECFM

+            _____
0             1. The  HEX keyword  instructs  the  utility to  print  al
                 records in hexadecimal format.  The HEXT keyword differ
                 from the HEX  keyword in that it also gives  the user a
                 EBCDIC translation  of the hexadecimal data.    The DUM
                 keyword instructs  the utility to  print all  records i
                 abend dump format.   By default, all records are printe
                 in character format only.
0          ×  2. SKIP(r) specifies that the first r records are not to b
                 listed or copied.
0          ×  3. STOPAFT(s)  specifies that the utility  is to stop afte
           ×     outputting s records.   The default is STOPAFT(0)  whic
           ×     means stop after end of file on the input dataset.
0             4. The COPY keyword will cause  the utility to copy record
                 from the input dataset to an output dataset.  The outpu
                 dataset must be of sequential organization regardless o
                 the format  of the input  dataset.   Only  those record
                 selected will appear in the output dataset.  This optio
                 requires that the  user supply a SYSOUT  data definitio
                 card,  including appropriate  DCB information,  definin
           ×     the dataset to contain the  copied records.   The recor
           ×     to be copied  is first subjected to  the requirements o
           ×     the COL  option and  is then  compressed or  expanded i
           ×     required.   The EXPAND and COMPRESS options are mutuall
           ×     exclusive.    The  record  may   then  be  automaticall
           ×     subjected to  further expansion  or truncation  in orde
           ×     that  it  meets  the record  format  and  record  lengt
           ×     requirements of the output copy file.
0          ×  5. DSORG(v)  selects the dataset  organization of the inpu
                 file.   The following is a  table of possible values fo
                 v.

                 orgainzation, the user may print the key associated wit
                 each record by specifying the option PRINTKEY.

                 messages.

                 applicable only  to the  character and  hex format  typ
                 outputs.    1  indicates  single  spacing  (default  fo
                 character output);  2 indicates  double spacing (defaul
                 for hex output); and 3 indicates triple spacing.
0          × 10. Keyword COL allows the user to  print (and copy)  only
                 portion (from column (or byte) f to column (or byte)  t
           ×     of each  input record.    Default is  COL(1).   If  t i
                 omitted,  processing continues to the  end of each inpu
                 record.   For dump format output,   f is rounded down t
                 the next lowest fullword boundary.
0          × 11. Compress input  record to  n bytes  (if length  of inpu
           ×     record  is greater  than n  bytes).    Compression of
           ×     record  involves the  dropping of  a specific  characte
           ×     (see CCHAR  option)  from the  end of the  input record
           ×     The COPY  option must also  be specified.    The defaul

0          × 13. Expand  input record  to  n bytes  (if  length of  inpu
           ×     record is  less than n  bytes).   Expansion of  a recor
           ×     involves the adding  of a specific character  (see ECHA
           ×     option) to the end of the input record.  The COPY optio
           ×     must also be specified.  The default (and maximum) valu
           ×     for n is the maximum output copy file record length.
