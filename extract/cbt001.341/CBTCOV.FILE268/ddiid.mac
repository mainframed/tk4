      LOGICAL FUNCTION  DDIID (DUMMY)
C
C     MODIFIED FOR USE WITH ABE
C
C     (Plot Identifier)
C     Return .TRUE. if  the device interface  has the ability  to
C     write a plot identifying label (and presumably did so), and
C     .FALSE.  if it does not.  The INTEGER dummy argument is not
C     modified.

C     This routine is provided for use by PLTID as a clean way of
C     eliminating  multiple   versions  of   PLTID.    Generally,
C     interfaces  to  display   terminals  will   not  write   an
C     identifying label since this simply wastes time on an image
C     which  is  rarely  preserved  anyway.   Similarly,  if  the
C     interface is to  a hardcopy device  which already  provides
C     this service  (perhaps through  output spooling  software),
C     the label normally drawn by  PLTID can be suppressed.   For
C     most hardcopy devices, PLTID's label is desirable, and this
C     routine should return .FALSE. in such cases.
