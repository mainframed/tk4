 /*        GTEDS/MIDWEST OS/VS PTF NUMBER 00065
  *
  *        TYPE             - ZAP
  *        RELEASE          - 3.8A
  *        PTF LEVEL        - 8201
  *        KEYPHRASE        - CVOL PROCESSOR ENHANCEMENT
  *        ENVIRONMENT      - 12MB 3033 - BATCH,RJE,NJE,TSO,IMS,VTAM
  *                         - 16MB 3033 - BATCH,RJE,NJE,TSO,IMS,VTAM
  *        PROBLEM          - THE CVOL PROCESSOR SEARCHES THE PCCB
  *                           CHAIN AND GOES THROUGH ALLOCATION FOR A
  *                           CATALOG AND BUILDS A PCCB JUST TO OBTAIN
  *                           THE VOLUME SERIAL NUMBER OF THE CVOL.
  *        SOLUTION         - CHANGE CVOL PROCESSOR TO OBTAIN THE VOLUME
  *                           SERIAL NUMBER FROM THE LAST SIX (6)
  *                           CHARACTERS OF THE CATALOG NAME SINCE ALL
  *                           CVOL CATALOG NAMES ARE IN THE FORM OF
  *                           SYSCTLG.VVOLSER.
  *
  *        RESULTS/BENEFITS - THIS HAS MANY BENEFITS AND CREATES SOME
  *                           MINOR RESTRICTIONS. THE BENEFITS ARE:
  *                       .1  WE NO LONGER HAVE TO GO ALL THE WAY THROUG
  *                           ALLOCATION EVERY TIME WE SIMPLY NEED TO
  *                           OBTAIN THE VOLSER NUMBER FOR A CVOL.
  *                           THIS REDUCES CPU TIME AND I/O ACTIVITY TO
  *                           THE MASTER CATALOG.
  *                       .2  THIS ALLOWS UNRECEIVED PASSED DATA SETS TO
  *                           BE CATALOGED AND/OR UNCATALOGED (DISPOSITI
  *                           PROCESSING) BY JOB TERMINATION AFTER AN AB
  *                           HAS OCCURRED (WITHOUT THIS MOD YOU GET A N
  *                           CATALOGED 4 BECAUSE AT JOB TERMINATION THE
  *                           ALLOCATION FOR THE CVOL CATALOG IS NOT ALL
  *                       .3  THIS ALLOWS DATA SETS CATALOGED IN CATALOG
  *                           OTHER THAN THE MASTER CATALOG TO BE REFERE
  *                           IN THE JES PROC (BUT NOT IN LNKLST00 SINCE
  *                           DOESN'T GET THIS FAR).
  *
  *                           THIS ALSO CREATES SOME MINOR RESTRICTIONS:
  *
  *                       .1  THE NAMES OF ALL CVOL CATALOGS MUST BE
  *                           SYSCTLG.VVOLSER, WHERE VOLSER IS THE SERIA
  *                           NUMBER ON WHICH THAT CVOL CATALOG RESIDES.
  *                       .2  SINCE THE CVOL CATALOG IS NO LONGER ACTUAL
  *                           ALLOCATED THERE IS NO WAY THAT A CVOL ON A
  *                           NON-RESIDENT VOLUME CAN BE ACCESSED I.E. A
  *                           CVOL CATALOGS MUST BE ONLINE.
