              7  SEE NEW STUFF BELOW:
 PDS CONTAINS:
  MACROS:  - @ENT @RET @STCK CLEAR CONV ENTER ENTERX LEAVE MSG
             PDEDSNAM REGS SYSGET SYSPUT  TSCVDATE
             VTCALL VTEXCP VTFMT VTOC VTOCMSG VTOCOM VTOCPARS

 $DOC      - THIS FILE.
 JCL       - SAMPLE JCL USED TO DUMP PDS.
             AND TRY TO CHECK THAT I DIDNT FORGET ANY MACROS.
 TSGTFMAP  - PGM TO REDUCE GTF SIO/IO TRACE RECORDS.
             SEE COMMENTS AT BEGINNING OF PROGRAM FOR HOW TO RUN.
             USES SUBR: TSCVDATE, VTOCEXCP
             NOW SUPPORTS XA FORMAT OF GTF RECORDS
 TSCALL    - TSOCP TO CALL PROGRAMS FROM "TASKLIB"/STEPLIB/
             LNKLST/LPALIB. IDEA IS TO NOT USE TSO "CALL" WITH
             HARDCODED LOADLIBS THAT HAVE TO BE OPENED.
 TSCVDAT   - SUBROUTINE TO MAKE NICE PRINTABLE DATE FOR HEADINGS.
 TSDYNLXA  - PGM XA DYNALIST TO LIST ESOTERIC UNITNAMES
             (NOTE: USES ESTAES TO EXECUTE UNAUTHORIZED!!)
 TSENQSP3  - TSOCP (AKA $DENQ) SCAN FOR GENERIC SYSDSN ENQS,
             LOOK FOR ENQ LOCKOUTS, LOOK FOR RESERVE ENQS.
             (NOTE USES GQSCAN)
 TSSPACE   - TSOCP TO LIST SPACE, IXVTOC STATUS, PATH(CHAN/CHPID),
             LSPACE(FREE) SPACE, #USERS, DEVTYPE, AND ADDRESS
             FOR DASD. CAN ASK FOR ALL DASD WITH LESS THAN
             N PATHS TO SEE IF ANY DASD PATHS ARE MISSING.
 TSSYSTEM  - TSOCP SHOW RELEASE, CPUTYPE, CPUSERIAL#, SYSRES,
             REAL STORAGE, HOW LONG SINCE (IPL/SET IPS).
 VTOC      - TSOCP VTOC - FIXED TO SP3/XA UCBSCAN,
             HANDLES 123 EXTENTS WITH DF/EF.
             (NOTE I USE ENTRY VTOCEXCP FOR VTOC READING IN TSGTFMAP)
 ** SORRY THERE ISNT A LOT OF NEW DOC, BUT I WOULDNT GET THIS STUFF
 ** OUT UNTIL 1986 IF I DID THAT.
 ** EVERYTHING HAS BEEN USED ON SP3 AND XA2.1.1.
