MON#     TITLE 'APEMAN - DUMMY MONITOR ROUTINE'
MON#     CSECT
*   THE PURPOSE OF THIS ROUTINE IS TO AVOID AN ABEND IN MONRUN IF IT
*   TRIES TO LOAD A NONEXISTENT MONITOR ROUTINE.  INSTEAD THIS ROUTINE
*   WILL ABEND, ALLOWING THE SPIE EXIT ROUTINE OC4 TO GET RID OF IT.
*
*   WE MUST SAVE REGISTERS ON ENTRY, AS THE OC4 ROUTINE WILL RELOAD
*   THEM FROM THE SAVE AREA.

         STM   14,12,12(13)   SAVE REGISTERS FOR SPIE ROUTINE

*   THIS ROUTINE DEPENDS ON REGISTER 7 POINTING AT THE CORRESPONDING
*   ABEND COUNTER IN MONRUN.  WE SET IT TO 1 SO THAT NO SNAP DUMP WILL
*   BE GENERATED, AND ONE PROGRAM INTERRUPT WILL SUFFICE TO MAKE US GO
*   AWAY.
