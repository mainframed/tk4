 Y-PUNCH    On a punched card, the very top row.
            This is sometimes called the 12-punch because
            it's the 12th row from the bottom
 ZAP        Not an acronynm or an abbreviation. As in the
            comics, when something gets zapped it's hit
            with a quick and powerful blow. In this
            case, it's a quick and powerful fix for a
            bug.

 AM/I       AM/I was the original name for a database system that
            eventually wound up being cut back in scope and renamed
            AM/0. AM/0 came out as VSAM.

 NPL        NPL (for New Programming Language) was the original developm
            name for PL/I. As that name became known, England's National
            Physics Laboratory objected, so the name was changed,
            briefly, to MPPL (for Multi-Purpose etc.) and then released
            as PL/I.

 JUBILEE    JUBILEE was the development name for the 3800 laser printer

 OAK        OAK was the name given, following COMANCHE, to the 3850 Mass
            Storage System

 COMANCHE   COMANCHE was the early development for the 3850
            Mass Storage System

 PEACHTREE  PEACHTREE was the development name for the Series/1.

 CP         CP was the original name for VM. (Part of VM is
            still called CP.)

 27RN       27RN was the development name for the 3705 Communications
            Controller. (Would you believe the "RN" stood for
            "Really New?")

 Q10        Right after the annoumcement of the System 360. IBM in
            California produced, for their marketing reps, a list
            of the most asked questions about it, together with
            "approved" answers. These were printed on cards, one
            question per card. Question 10, shown on the card as
            "Q10" was "Why Operating System/360?"
            At the next SHARE meeting Thomas Watson was the speaker
            at the General Session and the SHARE member who
            introduced him (who shall rename nameless here) said
            "Here's Mr. Watson, who will give the answer to Q10."
            Needless to say, Watson didn't know what it was all
            about, but after the session he asked his aides and, on
            finding out what was going on, gave orders to have ALL
            the Q cards recalled and destroyed immediately.
