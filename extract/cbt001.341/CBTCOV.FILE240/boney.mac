                          --OR --


           PATHETIQUE AND CRITIQUE IN 0-F MINOR
         FOR SYSTEMS, OPERATIONS, AND DEVELOPMENT
                      OPUS NUMBER 2.3



            WORDS:  ANNE ASHLEY & DAVE THEWLIS
            MUSIC:  HOYT AXTON





 IF IT IPLS THEN JES WON'T START,
 AND IF IT GETS UP THEN IT FALLS APART.
 MVS IS BREAKING MY HEART!
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER IN THE MORNING,
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER.

 THE SYSTEM IS CRASHING, I'M HAVING A FIT,
 AND DSS DOESN'T HELP A BIT,
 A SHOVEL CAME WITH THE DEBUGGING KIT.
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER IN THE MORNING,
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER.

 CHORUS:  WORK YOUR FINGERS TO THE BONE AND WHAT DO YOU GET?
          BONEY FINGERS, BONEY FINGERS.

 THE SRM IS A TURKEY IN DISGUISE,
 AND MF/1 IS TELLING ME LIES:
 START A JOB AND THE WHOLE THING DIES!
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER IN THE MORNING,
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER.

 THE MEMORIES WON'T COMMUNICATE,
 AND ASM SIMPLY DOESN'T RELATE,
 SWAPPING SEEMS TO BE CONTROLLED BY FATE.
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER IN THE MORNING,
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER.

 CHORUS

 THE CONTROL BLOCK STRUCTURE IS REALLY A MESS
 WHO DESIGNED IT ARMONK WON'T CONFESS
 INbREEDING AND INCEST IS OUR BEST GUESS, BUT
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER IN THE MORNING,
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER.
1
 THERE STILL EXISTS A CVT,
 BUT IT LOST OUT TO THE ASCB,
 AND WHERE THE HELL IS MY TCB?
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER IN THE MORNING,
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER.

 ADDRESS SPACES ARE ALL THE RAGE,
 MY TCB MUST BE OUT IN A PAGE,
 WE THINK THE ARCHITECT'S KEPT IN A CAGE!
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER IN THE MORNING,
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER.

 I CAN'T GET DISPATCHED, WITHOUT A DOUBT,
 THE SRM'S IN CHARGE OF THE ROUT,
 AND HE'S GOT THE APG SWAPPED OUT!
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER IN THE MORNING,
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER.

 CHORUS

 ONCE UPON A TIME, THERE WAS A JES2,
 ANOTHER DEFINITION IS, YOU REALLY GET SCREWED.
 WHEN JES3 COMES, IT WILL DO IT TO YOU, BUT
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER IN THE MORNING,
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER.

 JES2'S THERE AND THEY SAY IT WORKS,
 NO JES3 BUT THEY CLAIM IT LURKS.
 WE SUSPECT JES5 WILL BE WRITTEN BY TURKS.
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER IN THE MORNING,
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER.

 TSO IS ANOTHER BIG MESS,
 THE SYSTEM GETS MORE AND THE USER GETS LESS.
 LET'S REPLACE THE SUCKER WITH TSS!                           @BWM78311
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER IN THE MORNING,
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER.

 CHORUS

 WITH SMP THEY FUMBLED THE BALL,
 AND PL/S MEANS TAKING A FALL.
 THE SYSTEMS STAFF IS CLIMBING THE WALL!
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER IN THE MORNING,
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER.

 PDS'S ARE REALLY GOOD FILES
 BUT PID HAS DEVELOPED NEW STYLES:
 THE SYSTEM NOW IS SHIPPED IN PILES.
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER IN THE MORNING,
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER.

 CHORUS
1
 OUR SALESMAN TELLS US THAT IT'S ALL A BREEZE,
 THE CONVERSION'S DONE WITH THE GREATEST OF EASE,
 OUR DEVELOPMENT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO FREEZE, WELL
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER IN THE MORNING,
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER.

 BUT HE DOESN'T MENTION, WITH HIS USUAL TACT,
 THE ROUND HEELS WE NEVER SEEM TO LACK,
 'CAUSE HE GETS 4K TO KEEP US ON OUR BACKS.
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER IN THE MORNING,
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER.

 IN IBM, EVERYONE'S A BROTHER,
 LIKE MOST FAMILIES THEY DON'T TALK TO EACH OTHER
 AND MVS CLEARLY STARTS WITH 'MOTHER'
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER IN THE MORNING,
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER.

 CHORUS

 SOMEDAY MAYBE THEY WILL DO IT RIGHT,
 BUT NOT WITHOUT ONE HELL OF A FIGHT,
 CAN WE EVER GET THEM TO SEE THE LIGHT?
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER IN THE FUTURE,
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER.

 WHETHER Q OR FS THE RESULT'S THE SAME:
 GETTING SCREWED WILL STILL BE THE NAME OF THE GAME.
 AND WE ALL KNOW WHERE TO LAY THE BLAME, BUT
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER IN THE FUTURE,
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER.

 TO OBTAIN OUR INPUT IS THEIR CURRENT AMBITION
 SO WE OFFER THIS CRITIQUE OF OUR OWN VOLITION:
 COULDN'T IBM LEARN A NEW POSITION?
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER IN THE FUTURE,
 MAYBE THINGS WILL GET A LITTLE BETTER.

 CHORUS:  WORK YOUR FINGERS TO THE BONE AND WHAT DO YOU GET?
          BONEY FINGERS, BONEY FINGERS.

          WORK YOUR FINGERS TO THE BONE AND WHAT DO YOU GET?
          BONEY FINGERS, BONEY FINGERS.
