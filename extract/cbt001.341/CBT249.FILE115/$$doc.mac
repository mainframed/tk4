  This library contains exits and modifications that allow
  specifying passwords for datasets within the JCL on an sp133 system.
  It consists of:
  JES2 exit 4
  JES2 exit 7
  JES2 exit 8
  JES2 source update to HASPSSSM
  jES2 user macro $USERCBS
  Zap to lmod READPSWD csect READPSWD
  WTO  exit IEECVXIT

  The reason for the zap to READPSWD is to alter the IEC301A message
  so that it will come out with the dsname which is needed so the
  IEECVXIT exit can pick it up.

  The PASSWORD Statement


  Control Statement

          The PASSWORD statement permits you to specify passwords
          for VSAM and NON-VSAM datasets.


  The PASSWORD statement consists of the characters /* in columns 1 and
  2, the word PASSWORD in columns 3-10, a password beginning in column
  12 followed by at least one blank and an optional keyword parameter
  DSN.
  Columns 72-80 are ignored.

     __________________________________________

   ×/*PASSWORD password ×parameter×
+                        _       _

  The following parameter may be coded.
   _               _
  ×DSN=data set name×
+  _               _


  password
    the password (1 to 8 characters) for specified dataset

  DSN=data set name
    The data set name (1 to 44 characters) for which password is to be
    used.

  Rules for coding
    * Only 15 PASSWORD statements may be coded
    * If DSN= keyword parameter is not specified on a PASSWORD statement
      the password on that statement will be used as the default
      password
    * If more than one PASSWORD statement has the same data set name
      (or no data set name) the last PASSWORD statement specifying the
      data set name is used.
    * Place the PASSWORD statement after the job statement.


  Example of the PASSWORD statement
    /*PASSWORD WTFGASAW DSN=MY.DSN
   The password WTFGASAW will be used for the data set MY.DSN
