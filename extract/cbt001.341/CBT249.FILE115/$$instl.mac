 NOTES:
  STEP 1 : THE MAJOR REASONS FOR UPDATING HASPSSSM ARE TO:
        1) ADD ENTRY POINTS FOR HCBGM HCBRD AND HCBFM SO THESE
           ROUTINES CAN BE CALLED FROM EXIT8.

        2) LET PCT BE A VALID TABLE FOR THE HCBRD ROUTINE.

  STEP 1 : IF DESIRED EXITS 4, 7 AND 8 CAN ALL BE LINKED INTO ANY
           LIBRARY IN THE LINK LIST HOWEVER DUE TO THE WAY EXIT 8
           IS SETUP IT MUST BE LINKED WITH TESTSSSM (HASPSSSM) WHICH
           MUST BE MLPA'ED IF IT IS PUT INTO "LINKLIB"

  STEP 2 : IF THE SVC NUMBER IS CHANGED IT MUST ALSO BE CHANGED IN
           IEECVXIT.
           IF DESIRED THE SVC CAN BE LINKED INTO A LINK LIST LIBRARY
           AND MLPA'ED

  STEP 3 : THE CONTROL CONTROL CARDS DO THE FOLLOWING
           HASPSSSM=          SPECIFIES USING THE NEW SSSM WITH EXIT8
                              LINKED IN.
           LOAD               LOAD THESE EXITS FROM LINKLIB NOTE THAT
                              EXIT8 IS NOT INCLUDED BECAUSE IT IS
                              LOADED WITH SSSM
           EXITNNN            TELLS JES THAT THESE EXITS ARE TO BE USED

  STEP 5 : IF DESIRED READPSWD CAN FIRST BE COPIED TO A LINK LIST
           LIBRARY BEFORE IT IS ZAPPED. IT WOULD THEN BE MLPA'ED

  STEP 6 : THE CLPA IS NOT NECCESSARY IF ALL LPA MODULES ARE BEING
           MLPA'ED
