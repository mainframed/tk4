* AUTHOR REGARDS AS MOST LIKELY SUBJECT TO LOCAL MODIFICATION.      YCC
* THIS IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A TRUE SYSTEM GENERATION OPTION,       YCC
* BECAUSE THE VALUES CHOSEN BELOW ARE FAIRLY GENEROUS AND           YCC
* SHOULD SERVICE MOST USERS AS IS. AS FEEDBACK DEVELOPS             YCC
* ON THIS RELEASE, NEW OPTIONS MAY BE ADDED HERE LATER.             YCC

*           IN CSA. THIS IS THE RETENTION PERIOD OF THE INCORE      YCC
*           AREA. IF THE SRB IS BEING DISPATCHED EVERY 60           GEI
*           SECONDS THEN THE DEFAULT VALUE OF 30 MEANS THAT         GEI

*           EFFECTS THE SAMPLE PERIOD FOR RCT AND DOMAIN            YCC
*           INFORMATION. THE DEFAULT VALUE OF 300 SETS THIS         GEI
*           PERIOD TO EVERY 60 SECONDS.                             GEI
