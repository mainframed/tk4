         HOG       A NEW COMMAND THAT DISPLAYS THE PAGING INFO FOR 12
                   JOBS FROM THEIR OUXB.  IT ALLOWS DETERMINATION OF
                   WHICH JOBS ARE AFFECTING THE PAGING RATE.
                   ***NOTE*** THIS IS NOT PART OF THE HARD COPY SUPPORT.


THE OBJECTIVE OF THE HARD COPY FUNCTION IS TO ALLOW THE USER TO
GET PRINTED COPIES OF THE DCMS SCREENS WITHOUT ANY MODIFICATION TO
ANY COMMAND PROCESSOR.  IT IS CONTROLLED BY PFK 10 AS DESCRIBED
BY THE HELP COMMAND SECTION ON COMMON PFKS.

THE FUNCTION IS INVOKED BY HITTING PFK 10 AT ANY POINT IN TIME.  THE
CURRENT COMMAND IF FROZEN (SIMILAR TO THE PROFILE KEY 2) AND A NEW
SCREEN APPEARS (GENERATED BY DCMSLOG$).  THIS SCREEN ALLOWS THE
MODIFICATION OF 4 VALUES:

         STATUS    EITHER 'ALLOC' OR 'UNALC' INDICATING THE ALLOCATION
                   AND OPEN STATUS OR AFTER MODIFICATION BY THE USER
                   THE DESIRED STATUS.
         MODE      EITHER 'OFF', 'ON', OR 'SINGLE' INDICATING WHETHER:
                   NO SCREENS ARE TO BE COPIED ('OFF')
                   ALL SCREENS OF THIS COMMAND ARE TO BE COPIED ('ON')
                   ONLY THE CURRENT SCREEN IS TO BE COPIED ('SINGLE')
         CLASS     THE SYSOUT CLASS OF THE SPUN-OFF DATASET
         DEST      THE JES DESTINATION OF THE SPUN-OFF DATASET

THE INITIAL VALUES ARE STATUS='UNALC', MODE='OFF', CLASS='A', AND
DEST='LOCAL'.  AFTER YOU CHANGE THE STATUS TO 'ALLOC' ONLY THE
STATUS AND MODE ARE DISPLAYED AND CHANGABLE.  WHEN YOU CHANGE
THE STATUS BACK TO 'UNALC' THE CURRENT DATASET IS CLOSED WITH THE
FREE=CLOSE OPTION ALLOWING IT TO PRINT IMMEDIATELY.

TO IMPLEMENT THIS FUNCTION THE FOLLOWING MODULES WERE ADDED OR CHANGED

         DCMSLOGT  THIS IS A NEW SUBTASK WHOSE PRIME FUNCTION
                   IS TO HANDLE REQUESTS TO ALLOC AND OPEN,
                   CLOSE AND FREE, OR BUILD AN OUTPUT SCREEN
                   IMAGE.  IT RECEIVES REQUESTS FROM A CENTRAL QUEUE
                   WHEN AWAKENED BY A POST.
         DCMSLOG$  THIS IS THE PFK 10 PROCESSOR.  IT HANDLES THE
                   SCREEN AND USER REQUESTS AND BUILDS WORK ELEMENTS
                   FOR DCMSLOGT.
         TERMIOLG  THE REPLACEMENT FOR THIS MODULE NOW PASSES
                   SCREENS TO THE DCMSLOGT MODULE FOR OUTPUT.
         TERMIO$
         TERMIO@   THESE MODULES WERE MODIFIED TO ATTACH DCMSLOG$
                   WHEN THEY DETECT A PFK 10 INPUT.  ALSO THEY
                   INVOKE TERMIOLG TO LOG OUT THE SCREEN IF
                   NECESSARY.
         TERMIO#
         TERM#     THESE MODULES WERE MODIFIED TO LOCATE THE TDCB
                   SETUP BY THE $DCMS MODULE IF IT EXISTS.
                   ***NOTE*** WITHOUT A TDCB THE HARD COPY FUNCTION
                              WILL NOT FUNCTION
         $DCMS
         #DCMS     THESE WERE MODIFIED TO ATTACH DCMSLOGT AND
                   ####TERM MODULE. ALSO THE TDCB IS PARTIALLY
                   INITIALIZED.
         CONTROL   THIS WAS MODIFIED TO ATTACH DCMSLOGT.



GOOD LUCK!!
