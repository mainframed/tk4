                SQA OVERFLOW TO CSA TRACKING.


 1.  To be able to identify who is using SQA a trap has to be
     added to the system in an alternate nucleus to add iden-
     tification to each getmain.  In member SQATRAP this data
     set is a copy of the trap as used at London Life.

 2.  After IPLing the alternate nucleus a sysdump with SQA
     should be taken to give a starting picture.  The follow-
     ing is how we do it.

     o   IPL alternate nucleus 2

     o   Run a spqescan to get a picture of sqa/csa usage.  A
         copy of this program is in member SPQESCAN of this
         data set.  An example of the JCL to run this program
         is in member SPQEJCL.  An example of the output of
         this program is in member SPQESPLE.

     o   Take a console dump of SQA for starting picture.

     o   At this point we let the system run for at least 24
         hr if not 48 hr.

 3.  You man want to take a snap shot at the time of the
     expansion to see who is causing the problem by do the
     following:

     o   Run the spqescan to get a picture of sqa/csa usage.

     o   Take a console dump of SQA for a picture at the time
         of the expansion.

 4.  After the trap has been running for the 24 to 48 hours
     we do the following:

     o   Stop all tasks except JES2, ACF2, and HSM.

     o   Run the spqescan to get a picture of sqa/csa usage.

     o   Take a console dump of SQA for an ending picture.

     o   Stop HSM.

     o   Run a spqescan to give a picture of sqa/csa usage.

     o   Take a console dump of SQA for an ending picture.

 5.  At this time we run a job to print the sqa that was
     dumped above to a disk data set. This is input to an
     analyze program which extracts the trap records and
     passes them to a SAS program for sorting and printing.
     A copy of the analyze program is in member SQAPRT, a
     copy of the jcl used to put the dump on disk, analyze
     the dump and the SAS program used to print the output is
     in member SQAJCL.  A sample of the output is in member
     SQASMPLE.
