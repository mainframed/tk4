1        NORTHWESTERN BANK EXITS, PROGRAMS, AND UTILITIES

  THE JES2 EXITS PREFIXED WITH 'JES' ARE FOR MVS SP 1.3.3 (HJE2329).
  THE EXITS PREFIXED WITH 'JSP' ARE FOR MVS SP 1.3.0 (HJE2326).  THERE
  ARE SOME FUNCTIONAL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE MODULES BECAUSE OF LOCAL
  REQUIREMENTS BUT ON THE WHOLE, THE EXITS ARE ALMOST IDENTICAL.


  JES$LF   - A JES2 EXIT (5) TO PROVIDE OPERATOR CAPABILITY TO DISPLAY
             DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT JOBS IN THE PRINT QUEUE.
             IT IS DESIGNED TO ENHANCE THE DISPLAY NORMALLY PROVIDED
             BY THE $DF COMMAND.

  JESEXIT1 - A JES2 EXIT (1) TO PROVIDE ENHANCEMENTS TO THE IBM SUPPLIED
             SEPARATOR PAGE.  SUPPORT IS ALSO PROVIDED FOR THE KODAK
             KOMSTAR MICROFICHE PROCESSOR, THE DATAGRAPHIX ARIS II
             MICROFICHE PROCESSOR AND THE IBM 6670 DOCUMENTATION
             PROCESSOR.

  JESEXIT5 - A JES2 EXIT (5) TO FILTER JES2 COMMANDS TO DISALLOW CERTAIN
             COMMANDS OR OPERANDS ON THE COMMANDS.

  JESEXIT6 - A JES2 EXIT (6) TO PERFORM STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT FOR JCL
             AS WELL AS SET THE JOB CLASS BASED UPON THE RESOURCES
             SUCH AS TAPE UNITS, REGION SIZE, OR CPU TIME.  VIOLATIONS
             TO STANDARDS AND JOB CLASS REPORTING IS MADE TO THE JOB
             MESSAGE DATA SET FOR THE JOB AS IF THE CONVERTER WAS
             PRODUCING THE ERROR MESSAGES.

  JESEXIT9 - A JES2 EXIT (9) TO ABEND TEST JOBS WHICH EXCEED THE
             ESTIMATED LINE COUNT WHILE ALLOWING ALL OTHER JOBS TO
             CONTINUE.

  JESXIT17 - A JES2 EXIT (17) TO VALIDATE THE SIGNON CARD FROM BSC
             RJE WORKSTATIONS.  THIS EXIT WILL ISSUE A CALL TO ACF2
             TO VALIDATE THE PASSWORD FOR THE REMOTEID.  THE SIGNON
             ATTEMPT WILL BE REJECTED WITH APPROPRIATE MESSAGES IF
             THE PASSWORD IS INVALID.

  JESMOD   - A JES2 MODIFICATION TO SP 1.3.3 TO USE THE EXTERNAL
             WRITER ID FOR THE DATAGRAPHIX ARIS II MICROFICHE
             PROCESSOR.  THE EXTERNAL WRITER ID IS PLACED IN THE
             DCT FOR ALL SELECTED JOBS.  JESEXIT1 WILL USE THIS
             INFORMATION TO SET THE JOBID FOR THE ARIS II.

  NWBCOPY  - A PROGRAM TO RUN AS A FRONT END TO IEBCOPY TO ISSUE
             SPF-LIKE RESERVES AGAINST ALL OUTPUT DATASETS PRIOR
             TO PASSING CONTROL TO IEBCOPY.

  CONSOLE  - A TSO COMMAND TO ALLOW A TSO TERMINAL TO EFFECTIVELY BE
             TURNED INTO A CONSOLE.  CODE WILL FUNCTION ONLY UNDER
             SP 1.3.

  SETPFKEY - A PROGRAM TO RUN AT IPL TIME TO SET THE DEFAULT VALUES
             FOR THE PFKEYS ON ALL DISPLAY CONSOLES AT IPL TIME.
             CODE WILL FUNCTION ONLY UNDER SP 1.3.

  AUTHSVC  - A TYPE 4 SVC TO ALLOW THE CALLER TO ENTER PROTECT KEY 0
             AS WELL AS WRITE A RECORD TO SMF TO RECORD THE FACT FOR
             AUDITING CAPABILITIES.  THIS IS THE SVC USED BY THE
             CONSOLE COMMAND.

  PRINTDOC - SAMPLE JCL TO PRINT THIS MEMBER ($DOC).

         THIS JES2 EXIT PROGRAM IS DESIGNED SOLVE THE OPERATORS
         DELIMMA OF USING THE $DF COMMAND TO VIEW JOBS AWAITING
         PRINT, BUT NOT BEING ABLE TO DETERMINE WHICH JOBS HAVE
         THESE ATTRIBUTES.


         THIS NEW COMMAND ALLOWS THE OPERATOR TO DETERMINE THE
         JOBNAME, JOB NUMBER, AND NUMBER OF PRINT LINES FOR EACH
         PRINT GROUP.  THE FORMAT OF THE NEW COMMAND IS AS FOLLOWS:

                        $LF,Q=CLASSES,J=JXXXX-YYYY,R=RXX-RYY,L
         WHERE

         Q=CLASSES    - OPTIONAL LIST OF UP TO 8 SYSOUT Q CLASSES
                        TO BE LISTED
                        (DEFAULTS TO ALL CLASSES)
         J=JXXXX-YYYY - OPTIONAL JOB OR RANGE OF JOBS TO BE LISTED
                        (DEFAULTS TO ALL JOBS)
         R=RXX-YY     - OPTIONAL LIST OF REMOTE DESTINATIONS TO BE
                        LISTED
                        (DEFAULTS TO ALL LOCAL)
         L            - OPTIONAL INDICATION TO USE THE LONG FORM OF
                        RESPONSE FOR MORE DETAIL
                        (DEFAULTS TO S - SHORT)

         KNOWLEDGE.  I REALIZE THAT EACH INSTALLATION HAS THEIR
         OWN REQUIREMENTS, BUT IT IS HELPFUL TO HAVE A WORKING
         EXAMPLE TO USE.
         WE DO NOT GUARANTEE TO KEEP THIS ROUTINE UP TO DATE.

         THIS JES2 EXIT PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO REPLACE THE IBM
         STANDARD PRINT AND PUNCH SEPARATOR ROUTINES.  THE PUNCH
         SEPARATOR LACE CARD AND BLANK CARD IS PRODUCED EXACTLY
         AS IBM PRODUCED THEM.  THE PRINT SEPARATOR PAGE IS THE
         SAME AS THAT PRODUCED BY IBM EXCEPT THAT INSTEAD OF TWO
         LINES OF BLOCK LETTERS, THREE ARE PRODUCED.  THE SECOND
         LINE OF THE BLOCK LETTERS IS THE FIRST EIGHT (8) BYTES
         OF THE PROGRAMMER NAME FIELD AND THE THIRD LINE IS THE
         BIN NUMBER.  NOTE THAT ONLY AS MANY LINES OF BLOCK
         LETTERS ARE PRODUCED AS THERE IS ROOM FOR AS DEFINED BY
         THE NUMBER OF LINES ON THE LOCAL OR REMOTE SPECIFICATIONS
         SPECIFICATIONS FOR &PRIDCT OR &TPIDCT.

         STARTED TASKS AND TSO LOGONS DO NOT PROVIDE A PROGRAMMER
         NAME FIELD OR A BIN NUMBER.  A SEPARATE BATCH JOB USING
         A PROGRAM CALLED JESTABLE LOADS A TABLE IN CSA OF TSO
         USERIDS AND STARTED TASK NAMES TO PROVIDE THE PROGRAMMER
         NAME AND BIN NUMBERS TO THIS EXIT.  THIS TABLE IS ANCHORED
         OFF OF THE MVS CVT AND CAN BE RELOADED AT ANY TIME.  IF A
         TSO USER OR STARTED TASK NAME IS NOT IN THAT TABLE, THE
         CONSTANT 'TECH SUP' IS USED FOR ALL STARTED TASKS AND
         'TSO     ' IS USED FOR ALL TSO OUTPUT.

         SUPPORT IS CODED IN THIS EXIT TO SUPPORT THE KODAK KOMSTAR
         MICROFICHE PROCESSOR.  ONE PRINTER NAME WAS RESERVED
         FOR THESE 3211 LOOKALIKE DEVICES AS WELL AS TWO SYSOUT
         CLASSES WHEN BEING 'PRINTED' ON THE KOMSTAR.  THE TITLE
         LINES GENERATED FOR THE MICROFICHE ARE INSTALLATION
         DEPENDENT, BUT ARE EASILY MODIFIABLE FOR ANY SETUP
         DESIRED.

         SUPPORT IS CODED IN THIS EXIT TO SUPPORT THE DATAGRAPHIX
         ARIS II MICROFICHE PROCESSOR.  TWO PRINTER NAMES WERE
         RESERVED FOR THESE 3211 LOOKALIKE DEVICES.  THE EXIT WILL
         SEND A COMMAND RECORD THE THE ARIS TO DEFINE THE JOBID TO
         USE FOR FORMATING THE REPORT(S).  THIS IS PROVIDED IN THE
         PROGRAMMER NAME FIELD OR AS THE EXTERNAL WRITER NAME.  THE
         USE OF THE WRITER NAME REQUIRES A MODIFICATION TO JES2 TO
         SET THE WRITER ID IN THE DCT USER FIELDS.

         SUPPORT IS CODED FOR THE IBM 6670 DOCUMENT PROCESSOR.
         A ONE LINE JOB SEPARATOR IS WRITTEN FOR THIS DEVICE.

         OWN SEPARATOR REQUIREMENTS, BUT IT IS HELPFUL TO HAVE
         A WORKING EXAMPLE TO USE.  NOTE THAT THE PUNCH LACE
         CARD PRODUCED BY THIS ROUTINE MATCHES THAT OF IBM BUT
         IT IS ALMOST UNUSABLE.  I DID NOT MODIFY IT SINCE WE
         DO ALMOST NO PUNCHING.
         WE DO NOT GUARANTEE TO KEEP THIS ROUTINE UP TO DATE.

         THIS JES2 EXIT PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO SCAN THE OPERANDS
         ON SELECTED JES2 COMMANDS AND DISALLOW THE COMMAND IF
         CERTAIN VALUES ARE USED.  THE EXIT AS CODES WILL PREVENT
         THE USE OF JOB RANGES (J1-J999) ON THE $AJ, $CJ, $DJ,
         $EJ, $HJ, $LJ, $OJ, AND $PJ COMMANDS.  THE $TJ COMMAND
         WILL NOT ALLOW THE USE OF C=X TO CHANGE THE EXECUTION
         CLASS OF A JOB.  THE $TC AND THE $TM COMMANDS ARE NOT
         ALLOWED.  THE $DN AND THE $PQ REQUIRE VALID OPERANDS
         IN ORDER TO BE EXECUTED.

         THE REASON FOR THESE RESTRICTIONS WAS TWO FOLD.  FIRST
         AND FOREMOST WAS TO PROTECT THE OPERATOR FROM ACCIDENTALLY
         CANCELLING, RELEASING, ETC. MORE JOBS THAN INTENDED.
         ALSO, HOWEVER, SOME OF THE COMMANDS WHICH PRODUCT HUGE
         NUMBERS OF REPLY MESSAGES WERE RESTRICTED.

         THIS JES2 EXIT PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO RUN AT CONVERTER
         TIME TO ENFORCE INSTALLATION JCL STANDARDS AND TO DETERMINE
         THE APPROPRIATE JOB CLASS BASED ON DEVICE UTILIZATION.

         THERE IS SOME INSTALLATION DEPENDENT CODE IN THIS EXIT
         ESPECIALLY IN THE JOB ACCOUNTING VERIFICATION ROUTINE
         AND THE DSNAME STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT ROUTINE.  THE JOB
         CLASSES ARE SET BY WAY OF A TABLE AS ARE THE UNITNAME
         ATTRIBUTES.  MUCH MORE COULD BE ENFORCED HERE OR IN
         OTHER EXITS OR BY A GOOD SECURITY SYSTEM.  WE FELT THAT
         IT WAS BETTER TO CATCH MANY ERRORS AT READER TIME
         RATHER THAN WAIT IN SOME CASES A LONG PERIOD OF TIME
         FOR VIOLATIONS TO OCCUR.

         THIS EXIT IS COMPLETELY FUNCTIONAL TO THE BEST OF MY
         KNOWLEDGE.  I REALIZE THAT THERE ARE A FEW LOOPHOLES IN
         THE CLASS DETERMINATION ROUTINE EXPECIALLY WHEN THE
         CATALOG COULD BE CHANGED AFTER SUBMITTING THE JOB.
         DESPITE ITS FEW LIMITATIONS, THIS EXIT HAS PROVEN TO
         BE INVALUABLE IN OUR RESOURCE UTILIZATION BALANCING
         SINCE THE INITIATORS CAN BE SET UP KNOWING THE DEVICES
         REQUIRED AND THE TIME WHICH THE JOB WILL USE THEM.
         WE DO NOT GUARANTEE TO KEEP THIS ROUTINE UP TO DATE.
         HOWEVER, WE WILL BE GLAD TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AS

1        VIOLATIONS OF JCL STANDARDS ARE DOCUMENTED BY MESSAGES
         WRITTEN TO THE JES2 MESSAGE DATA SET FOR THE JOB AND
         FLAGGED FOR JCL ERROR BY THE USE OF THE JES2 EXIT RETURN
         CODE TO THE JES2 CONVERTER SUB-TASK.

         THIS EXIT USES THE INTERNAL TEXT DATA SET FOR ITS
         PROCESSING.  JES2 PASSES EACH INTERNAL TEXT STATEMENT
         TO THIS EXIT FOR EXAMINATION AND/OR MODIFICATION.  THE
         EXIT WILL MAINTAIN A TABLE OF DATASET NAMES AND DEVICE
         COUNTS TO BE USED AT END OF PROCESSING FOR DETERMINING
         JOB CLASS.  THE ACB FOR THE MESSAGE DATA SET IS IN THE
         PCE WORK AREA AND CAN BE USED TO ISSUE ERROR MESSAGES
         TO THE JOB MESSAGE PORTION OF THE LISTING.

         ALSO, THE CONVERTER IS A DUMB ANIMAL WHEN IT COMES TO
         SYNTAX CHECKING.  CHECKING IS MADE FOR KEYWORD VALUES,
         BUT NONE IS MADE ON THE VALUE FOR THE KEYWORD.  IE.,
         50 CHARACTER DATA SET NAMES, 20 CHARACTER VOLUME SERIAL
         NUMBERS, AND NUMEROUS SYNTAX ERRORS CAN PASS UNDETECTED
         THROUGH THE CONVERTER.  THESE ERRORS WILL BE CAUGHT BY
         THE INTERPRETER WHEN THE JOB GOES INTO EXECUTION, BUT
         THIS EXIT MUST PROCESS THEM.  CURRENTLY, ALL DETECTED
         ERRORS OF THIS TYPE WILL ISSUE A MESSAGE DESCRIBING THE
         ERROR AND FLAG THE JOB TO FAIL.  THE ESTAE ROUTINE,
         WHEN ENTERED FOR AN ABEND, WILL SET THE CLASS TO 'A'
         AND RECOVER TO PROTECT THE CONVERSION SUBTASK FROM ABEND
         AND CONSEQUENT LOSS OF THE JOB.

1        CLASS DETERMINATION IS MADE BY KEEPING A COUNT OF ALL
         OF THE MOUNTABLE DEVICES USED PER STEP.  THESE COUNTS
         ARE SAVED IN AN INTERNAL TABLE TO BE PROCESSED AT END
         OF INTERNAL TEXT.  ALSO SAVED IN THE TABLE ARE ENTRIES
         FOR DD STATEMENTS WHICH USED MOUNTABLE DEVICES
         FOR USE IN REFERBACKS AND UNIT=AFF.  IF THE UNIT
         HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED AT THE END OF PROCESSING
         FOR A DD STATEMENT, THE CATALOG IS SEARCHED.  IF THE
         CATALOGED DEVICE IS SYSDA, THE UCBS ARE SEARCHED
         TO DETERMINE IF THE PACK IS MOUNTED AS PRIVATE,
         RESERVED, OR PERMANENTLY RESIDENT.  IF THE PACK
         IS NOT FOUND, A PRIV DISK MOUNT WILL BE CHARGED.
         CLASS IS SET ON THE BASIS OF THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF TAPES
         PER STEP, MAXIMUM NUMBER OF PRIV DASD DEVICES PER STEP,
         TOTAL MAXIMUM MOUNTABLE DEVICES PER STEP, MAXIMUM REGION
         PER STEP, AND ESTIMATED EXECUTION TIME FOR JOB.

         INPUT TO THIS EXIT DURING TESTING WAS CREATED BY USING
         ONE OF THE LATEST VERSIONS OF "QUEUE" ON THE MODS TAPES
         WHICH ALLOWS ACCESS TO THE INTERNAL TEXT DATA SET
         FILE 5.  ONCE LISTING THE INTERNAL TEXT DATASET, THE
         USER CAN THEN ENTER "SAVE DSN" AND CREATE A DATASET
         WHICH THE TSO DRIVER CAN USE.

         THE TSO DRIVER PROGRAM IS TESTJES.  READ THE DOCUMENTATION
         FOR THAT PROGRAM.

1        THERE ARE SEVERAL ASSEMBLER VARIABLES AVAILABLE TO TAILOR
         THE PROGRAM TO CERTAIN OPTIONS.

         &TSO     'NO'         ASSEMBLE FOR TSO TESTING
         &CAMLST  'YES'        SEARCH CATALOG FOR DATASETS
         &ERRMSG  'YES'        PRODUCE JOBFAILED BY EXIT MESSAGE
         &SDUMP   'YES'        PRODUCE CONSOLE DUMP FOR ABENDS
         &FLUSH   'YES'        FLUSH JOB FOR STANDARDS VIOLATIONS
         &MODIFY  'YES'        MODIFY JOB CLASS IN JCT AND JQE
         &UCBSEAR 'YES'        SEARCH THE UCBS FOR UNMOUNTED PACKS

         &TSO

         WHEN TESTING THIS EXIT UNDER THE TSO INTERFACE, THE LOCAL
         VARIABLE &&TSO SHOULD BE CHANGED TO 'YES' FROM 'NO' TO
         CHANGE THE $$WTO INSTRUCTIONS TO WTO INSTRUCTIONS AND
         BYPASS THE ESTAE MACROS SO THAT THE TEST COMMAND CAN
         DETERMINE THE ADDRESS OF THE ABEND.


         &CAMLST

         THE ONLY WAY THAT THE EXIT CAN DETERMINE THE DEVICE TYPE
         FOR CATALOGED DATA SETS IS TO ISSUE THE CAMLST LOCATE
         MACRO FOR EVERY DATASET FOR WHICH NO UNIT IS SPECIFIED.
         THIS HAS TREMENDOUS OVERHEAD, BUT IS REQUIRED TO SET THE
         JOB CLASS CORRECTLY BASED ON THE NUMBER OF MOUNTABLE
         UNITS.


         &ERRMSG

         A MESSAGE WILL BE WRITTEN TO THE CONSOLE AND THE JOBLOG
         FOR THE JOB WHENEVER A STANDARDS VIOLATION IS DETECTED
         BY THE EXIT.  WITHOUT THIS MESSAGE, THE PERSON WHO
         SUBMITTED THE JOB MAY HAVE DIFFICULTY DETERMINING THAT
         THE JOB WAS FLUSHED FOR A VIOLATION.  THE OPTION TO
         BYPASS THE MESSAGE IS AVAILABLE HOWEVER.


         &SDUMP   'YES'        PRODUCE CONSOLE DUMP FOR ABENDS

         A CONSOLE DUMP CAN BE TAKEN BY THE ERROR RECOVERY ROUTINE
         WHEN REQUESTED BY THE OPTION.  SINCE ERRORS ARE HOPEFULLY
         FEW AND FAR BETWEEN, IT PROBABLY IS A GOOD IDEA TO TAKE A
         DUMP WHEN THEY OCCUR.  THE DUMP CAN BE CUT OFF IF DESIRED.


         &FLUSH   'YES'        FLUSH JOB FOR STANDARDS VIOLATIONS

         THE EXIT CAN BE RUN IN "NOFLUSH" MODE DURING WHICH TIME
         ALL ERROR MESSAGES WILL BE ISSUED, BUT THE JOB WILL NOT
         TERMINATED BY THE EXIT.  THIS IS ESPECIALLY USEFUL DURING
         IMPLEMENTATION.


1        &MODIFY  'YES'        MODIFY JOB CLASS IN JCT AND JQE

         THE JOB CLASS OF THE JOB CAN BE SET BY THE EXIT BASED
         ON THE RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS OF THE JOB.  THE MODIFICATION
         OF THE JOB CLASS IS MADE BY MODIFYING THE JOBCLASS FIELDS
         IN THE JCT AND THE JQE SINCE THEY WILL BE REWRITTEN AND
         REQUEUED FOLLOWING CONVERSION.  IT MAY BE NOTED THAT THERE
         IS CODE IN THE EXIT TO SET JOB "RESOURCE" INDICATORS BASED
         ON JOB CATAGORY, PROGRAM NAME, AND OTHER CRITERIA.  THIS
         CODE IS NOT CURRENTLY BEING USED AND IS IN THE PROGRAM
         FOR INFORMATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY.  THIS CAN BE USED WITH
         THE MELLON BANK RESOURCE MOD WHICH IS AVAILABLE ON THE
         MODS TAPE (I THINK).  IF YOU TRY TO INCORPORATE THIS CODE
         INTO THE RESOURCE MOD, ALL YOU SHOULD HAVE TO DO IS TO
         "OR" THE PROPERLY SETUP RESOURCE BITS INTO THE EXISTING
         BITS IN THE JQE.  GOOD LUCK.


         &UCBSEAR 'YES'        SEARCH UCBS FOR UNMOUNTED PACKS

         THE EXIT SEARCHES THE UCBS TO DETERMINE IF THE DASD
         VOLUMES REFERENCED BY A DD STATEMENT ARE MOUNTED.  THE
         JOB CAN BE CHARGED FOR THE MOUNT OR TERMINATE WITH A
         JCL ERROR AS IS CURRENTLY THE CASE.

1                  JOB CARD FIELDS PROCESSED

         1)  JOBNAME
         2)  ACCOUNTING FIELD
             THE FORMAT OF THE FIRST ACCOUNTING IS VERIFIED BASED
             ON THE CATAGORY OF JOB BEING PROCESSED.  NOTE THAT

             ACCOUNTING FIELDS.
         3)  PROGRAMMER NAME
             THE PROGRAMMER NAME IS SAVED BUT IS CURRENTLY NOT
             BEING USED.  IT COULD BE USED AS ANOTHER SOURCE OF
             INFORMATION FOR AUTHORIZATION CHECKING.
         4)  JOB CLASS
             THE JOB CLASS IS SAVED SINCE CERTAIN JOB CLASS MAY BE

             RESOURCES FOR THIS CLASS MAY HAVE TO BE VERIFIED.
         5)  PERFORM
             THE USE OF PERFORM ON THE JOB CARD IS RESTRICTED
             TO CERTAIN CATAGORIES OF JOBS.
         6)  TYPRUN
             THIS PARAMETER IS PROCESSED TO DETERMINE IF HOLD
             WAS SPECIFIED.  CERTAIN JOB CLASSES REQUIRE THAT
             TYPRUN=HOLD BE SPECIFIED
         7)  TIME
             IF TIME IS NOT SPECIFIED ON THE JOB CARD, THE
             INTERNAL TEXT WILL BE MODIFIED TO SET THE JOB
             DEFAULT TIME TO 1 MINUTE OF CPU.
             ALSO THE USE OF TIME=1440 IS RESTRICTED TO CERTAIN
             CATAGORIES OF JOBS.
         8)  ADDRSPC
             THE USE OF ADDRSPC ON THE JOB CARD IS RESTRICTED

             THE USE OF PRTY ON THE JOB CARD IS RESTRICTED
             TO CERTAIN CATAGORIES OF JOBS.

1                 EXEC CARD FIELDS PROCESSED

         1)  PGM
             THE PROGRAM NAME IS PROCESSED TO SET "RESOURCE"
             ROUTINGS.  OTHER USES COULD BE TO RESTRICT THE
             USE OF CERTAIN PROGRAMS.
         2)  REGION
             THE STEP REGION SIZE IS SAVED TO USE IN THE CLASS
             DETERMINATION ROUTINE.
         3)  TIME
             THE TIME PARAMETER IS CHECKED TO PREVENT THE USE
             OF TIME=1440 BY UNAUTHORIZED JOBS.
         4)  PERFORM
             THE USE OF PERFORM ON THE EXECUTE CARD IS RESTRICTED
             TO CERTAIN CATAGORIES OF JOBS.
         5)  ADDRSPC

1                   DD CARD FIELDS PROCESSED

         1)  DDNAME
             THE DDNAME IS SAVED IN A TABLE FOR POSSIBLE USE IN
             THE REFERBACK ROUTINE WHEN NEEDED.
         2)  DUMMY
             A DUMMY FILE WILL BE BYPASSED.
         3)  DSN
             THE DSNAME IS SAVED IN A TABLE FOR POSSIBLE USE IN
             THE REFERBACK ROUTINE, BY THE UNIT DETERMINATION
             ROUTINE OR BY THE AUTHORIZATION CHECKING ROUTINE.

                             N O T E

             IN ADDITION TO STANDARD DATASET NAMES, GENERATION
             DATA GROUPS AND REFERBACKS WILL BE PROCESSED.

         4)  DISP
             THE DISP IS PROCESSED TO CHECK FOR ILLEGAL DISPOSITION
             ON JOBLIB, JOBCAT, STEPLIB, STEPCAT, OR SYSTEM DATA
             SET.
         5)  UNIT
             THE UNIT NAME AND THE UNIT COUNT ARE SAVED IN CASE
             MULTIPLE UNITS OR PARALLEL MOUNTING IS REQUESTED.
             A UNIT NAME TABLE IS IN THE PROGRAM TO DETERMINE THE
             ATTRIBUTES OF THE SPECIFIED UNITNAME.
             UNIT = AFF IS ALSO PROCESSED.
         6)  VOL
             THE VOLUME COUNT IS SAVED IN CASE PARALLEL MOUNTING
             IS REQUESTED.
         7)  VOL=SER
             THE NUMBER OF VOL/SERS IS SAVED IN CASE PARALLEL
             MOUNTING IS REQUESTED.  THE FIRST VOLSER IS SAVED
             SO THAT ANY DD STATEMENTS WITHIN THE SAME STEP WHICH
             USE THE SAME VOLSER WILL USE IMPLIED UNIT=AFF
             PROCESSING.
         8)  VOL=REF
             THE VOL=REF IS USED TO SEARCH THE TABLE OF SAVED
             MOUNTABLE DEVICES TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE
             VOLUME REFERRED TO IS ON A MOUNTABLE DEVICE.
         9)  LABEL
             THE USE OF BYPASS LABEL PROCESSING (BLP) AND
             EXPDT=98000 IS RESTRICTED TO CERTAIN CATAGORIES
             OF JOBS.
         10) SYSOUT
             THE SYSOUT PARAMETER IS SCANNED TO RESTRICT THE
             USE IF AN INTERNAL READER TO CERTAIN CATAGORIES
             OF JOBS.  THIS IS TO PREVENT TEST JOBS FROM SUBMITTING
             OTHER CATAGORIES OF JOBS.  THE SYSOUT CLASS IS ALSO
             CHECKED TO STOP TEST JOBS FROM WRITING TO PRODUCTION
             SYSOUT CLASSES.

1        IF UNIT HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED, THE UNIT TYPE MUST
         BE SEARCHED FOR IN THE FOLLOWING ORDER:

         1)  THE DSNAME TABLE MAINTAINED BY THIS EXIT SINCE THE
             DATASET MAY HAVE BEEN CATALOGED OR PASSED BY A
             PREVIOUS DD STATEMENT.
         2)  THE SYSTEM CATALOG
         3)  THE SYSTEM UCBS MUST BE SEARCHED TO SEE IF THE
             REQUESTED DASD VOLUME IS MOUNTED OR ONLY MOUNTED
             PRIVATE IN WHICH CASE IT WILL BE DISMOUNTED AT END
             OF JOB.  IF NOT FOUND OR PRIVATE, IT IS A "PRIV"
             UNIT.

1        THE JOB CLASS DETERMINATION ROUTINE WILL USE ONY ONE OF
         SEVERAL TABLES DEPENDING ON JOB CATAGORY TO FIND A MATCH
         ON RESOURCES REQUIRED AND THE CORRESPONDING JOB CLASS.
         NOTE THAT SEVERAL CATAGORIES OF JOBS MAY SPECIFY A JOB
         CLASS TO SINGLE THREAD A SERIES OF JOBS OR BYPASS CERTAIN
         RESTRICTIONS.  SOME OF THESE MAY BE CHECKED FOR EXCEEDING
         THE ALLOWABLE RESOURCES FOR THAT CLASS.
         THE FORMAT OF THE CLASS TABLES IS AS FOLLOWS:
             1)  1 BYTE CLASS CODE APPLYING TO ENTRY
             2)  3 BYTE FILLER
             3)  HALFWORD MAXIMUM TAPES PER STEP
             4)  HALFWORD MAXIMUM PRIV UNITS PER STEP
             5)  HALFWORD MAXIMUM TOTAL DEVICES PER STEP
             6)  HALFWORD MAXIMUM REGION PER STEP
             7)  FULLWORD MAXIMUM CPU TIME FOR JOB

                            N O T E

         WHILE THE CLASS TABLES SUPPORT MOUNTABLE DASD DEVICES,
         WE NO LONGER HAVE ANY.  THUS THERE IS A CHECK IN THE
         CODE WHICH WILL FAIL ANY JOB REQUIRING A MOUNTABLE
         DASD DEVICE.

          THIS JES2 MODIFICATION WILL ENABLE THE USE OF THE JES2
          OUTPUT WRITER ID TO DEFINE THE DATAGRAPHIX MICROFICHE
          JOBID.  NORMALLY OUTPUT CONTAINING A WRITERID ARE NOT
          EASILY SELECTABLE FOR PRINT.  THIS MODIFICATION WILL
          BYPASS THE CHECK FOR THE CORRECT WRITERID AND SAVE THE
          WRITER NAME IN THE DCT USER FIELDS TO BE USED IN THE
          JOB SEPARATOR EXIT (JESEXIT1) WHERE THE NAME IS SENT
          TO THE MICROFICHE DEVICE AS THE JOBID.  THE JESEXIT1
          PROGRAM IN THIS FILE USES THIS INFORMATION, BUT THE
          MODIFICATION AND THE JES2 EXIT HAS BEEN CREATED FOR
          SP 1.3.3 JES2 ONLY (HJE2329).  THE SP 1.3.0 VERSION
          OF JESEXIT1 DOES NOT USE THE WRITER ID EVEN THOUGH

         THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO BE A FRONT END TO IEBCOPY
         TO PROVIDE DATASET INGEGRITY WHEN COPYING OR COMPRESSING
         DATA WITH IEBCOPY.  THE PROGRAM WILL ISSUE A RESERVE
         AGAINST EVERY DATASET WHICH IS DEFINED BY A DDNAME WHICH
         STARTS WITH "OUT" OR "COMP".  THE RESERVE WILL BE MADE
         IN EXACTLY THE SAME WAY THAT TSO SPF ISSUES ITS RESERVES
         WHEN UPDATING A MEMBER.
         ONCE ALL DATASETS HAVE BEEN RESERVED, CONTROL IS PASSED
         TO IEBCOPY TO PERFORM THE SPECIFIED FUNCTION.  WHEN
         IEBCOPY HAS FINISHED, CONSOLE IS RETURNED TO THE PROGRAM
         SO THAT THE DATASET RESERVES CAN BE RELEASED.

         SINCE IEBCOPY REQUIRES QUTHORIZATION, THIS PROGRAM MUST

         THIS TSO COMMAND WILL ALLOW A TSO USER TO FUNCTION AS
         AN O/S CONSOLE.  THE ORIGINAL CODE WAS PROBABLY THE SPY
         COMMAND ON THE MODS TAPES, BUT IT HAS EVOLVED OVER A
         PERIOD OF TIME.  I REGRET THAT THE NAME OF THE ORIGINATOR
         OF THE CODE HAS BEEN LOST.



         THE COMMAND CHECKS FOR TSO OPERATOR AUTHORITY FOR ACCESS.
         ALSO, PCF COMMAND LEVEL IS EXAMINED.  PCF LEVEL(0,0) USERS
         MAY ISSUE ALL O/S AND JES2 COMMANDS WHILE OTHERS MAY ONLY
         ISSUE O/S AND JES2 DISPLAY COMMANDS ONLY .  FOR FURTHER
         PROTECTION, A TABLE OF AUTHORIZED USERS IS ALSO USED TO
         DETERMINE THE USERS AUTHORITY TO EXECUTE THE COMMAND.  IF
         ALL OF THESE CHECKS ARE MET, THE USER WILL THEN BE PROMPTED
         FOR AN AUTHORIZATION PASSWORD.  WHILE EXCESSIVE, THESE KINDS
         OF CHECKS WERE REQUIRED HERE TO MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY.  SINCE
         THE CONSOLE BUFFERS ARE IN THEIR OWN ADDRESS SPACE UNDER SP 1.3
         AND THE COMMAND INTERFACE IS SVC 34, THIS COMMAND MUST BE
         AUTHORIZED.  THIS AUTHORIZATION IS CURRENTLY PROVIDED BY AN
         SVC CALL TO AN SVC WHICH SETS THE COMMAND IN PROTECT KEY 0
         TO SET THE AUTHORIZED BIT ON.  THUS THE COMMAND CAN PERFORM
         ALL REQUIRED FUCTIONS LATER AS REQUIRED.  THE SVC METHOD OF
         AUTHORIZATION IS USED INSTEAD OF IKJEFTE2 AUTHORIZATION SO
         THAT THIS COMMAND CAN RUN UNDER SPF OPTION 6.

         THE CONSOLE BUFFERS WHICH ARE DISPLAYED UPON ENTRY ARE THOSE
         FOR THE MASTER CONSOLE.  WHEN THE CONSOLE BEING VIEWED IS THE
         MASTER, MASTER-CONSOLE-ONLY COMMANDS SUCH AS DUMP AND FORCE

         KNOWLEDGE.  I HAVE MADE MODIFICATIONS TO CODE PROVIDED
         BY OTHER PEOPLE SO I CANNOT TAKE CREDIT FOR THE CODE.
         THE ENHANCEMENTS WHICH I HAVE PROVIDED SEEM TO MAKE
         INCLUSION OF THE CODE ON THIS TAPE WORTHWILE.

         THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO RUN AT IPL TIME TO SET THE
         DEFAULT VALUES FOR THE PFKEYS FOR THE SYSTEM DISPLAY
         CONSOLES.  THIS PROGRAM IS A MODIFIED VERSION OF A
         PROGRAM I FOUND ON THE CBT TAPE WHICH WAS WRITTEN BY
         MR. BARRY GOLDBERG OF THE AUTO CLUB OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.
         I MODIFIED THE PROGRAM TO USE CROSS MEMORY SERVICES UNDER
         SP 1.3 AND TO PROVIDE AN OPTIONAL PRINTED REPORT WHEN
         A SYSPRINT DD STATEMENT IS PRESENT.  COMMENT CONTROL
         CARDS CAN BE ENTERED WHEN AN '*' IS IN COLUMN 1.

         SINCE CROSS MEMORY CODE REQUIRES AUTHORIZATION, THIS
         PROGRAM MUST BE LINKED WITH AC=1.

./ ADD NAME=AUTHSVC

         THIS SVC IS A TYPE 4 SVC WRITTEN TO ALLOW THE CALLER TO
         ENTER KEY 0.  THIS SVC IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT FROM MOST
         OTHER SVC CODE IN THAT IT WRITES AN SMF RECORD FOR EACH
         CALL TO PERFORM A FUNCTION.  THE CALLING PROGRAM NAME IS
         ASSUMED TO BE POINTED TO BY REGISTER 0 ON INPUT AND ALL
         OTHER INFORMATION SUCH AS JOBNAME/TSONAME, PROGRAMMER
         NAME, AND ACCOUNTING INFORMATION IS EXTRACTED TO PROVIDE
         AN AUDIT CAPABILITY FOR UNAUTHORIZED USE.  THE FUNCTION
         TO BE PERFORMED IS IN REGISTER 1 ON INPUT.  A ZERO INDICATES
         THAT PROTECT KEY ZERO IS DESIRED.  ANY OTHER VALUE WILL
         RESET THE USER BACK TO THE PROTECT KEY IN THE TCB.

./ ADD NAME=TESTJES
1                         T E S T J E S

         THIS PROGRAM WAS WRITTEN TO TEST THE JES2 EXIT6 PROGRAM
         DESIGNED TO ENFORCE INSTALLATION JCL STANDARDS AND TO
         SET THE APPROPRIATE JOB CLASS BASED ON DEVICES USED.

         THE INPUT TO THIS PROGRAM IS A SEQUENTIAL FILE OF INTERNAL
         TEXT CREATED USING THE QUEUE COMMAND AVAILABLE ON MOST OF
         THE MODS TAPES.  FILE 5 OF A JOB CAN BE PROCESSED WITH ONE
         OF THE NEWER VERSIONS OF THE QUEUE COMMAND AND THE SAVE
         COMMAND CAN BE USED TO SAVE THIS FILE INTO A DATA SET.

         THE OUTPUT FILE MUST BE A JES2 SYSOUT DATA SET SINCE THE
         EXIT WILL DO A JES2 WRITE INTO THIS DATA SET WHENEVER AN
         ERROR IS DETECTED OR STEP STATISTICS ARE TO BE LISTED.

         THE REQUIRED JES2 CONTROL BLOCKS FOR THE EXIT ARE FAKED
         AND CREATED WITH JUST ENOUGH INFORMATION FOR THE EXIT
         TO FUNCTION.  THE CONTROL BLOCKS CREATED ARE THE JCT,
         PCE, AND JQE.

         THIS ROUTINE LOADS THE ENTRY NAMED 'EXIT6' FOR PROCESSING.
         THIS NAME MUST MATCH THE NAME ON THE $ENTRY STATEMENT IN
         THE EXIT CODE AND MUST BE AN ALIAS FOR OR THE ENTRY POINT
         FOR THE MODULE BEING TESTED SO THAT THE JES2 PREFIX STUFF
         CAN BE BYPASSED.

         WHEN TESTING THIS JES2 EXIT, THE LOCAL VARIABLE &&TSO
         IN THE EXIT SHOULD BE CHANGED TO 'YES' FROM 'NO' TO
         CHANGE THE $$WTO INSTRUCTIONS TO WTO INSTRUCTIONS AND
         BYPASS THE ESTAE MACROS SO THAT THE TEST COMMAND CAN
         DETERMINE THE ADDRESS OF ANY ABENDS.
