   PROGRAM APPLICATIONS

             The  P1000300  program  may  be used to create one or more
   files of selected records from a sequential input file.  Each extract
   performed on the basis of one or more field comparisons which are spe
   through control cards to the program.  Both input and output operatio
   performed  on  a  logical record level only, and concatenation of dat
   having unlike device characteristics is supported for the input file.

             A  partitioned  data  set  member may  be processed or crea
   utilizing the member name in parenthesis technique on the JCL DD card

             At  completion  or termination of the program, the highest
   code encountered within the program is passed to the calling program.

         specifies the length (in bytes) of the input field to be analyz
         The maximum length is dependent on the format of the data and i
         stated under the discussion on formats.

   STORAGE ESTIMATES

   P10003AA  will  operate successfully for a few extractions with small
   sizes in 62K.  However, to  more  accurately   estimate  the  main  s
   necessary, the following formula may be evaluated.

   Total storage = A+B+(C*D)+E+F+G

         A = 10240 (basic program size)
         B = maximum input logical record size
         C = Number of separate extractions to be performed
         D = 600       (working storage per extraction)
         E = Size of access method programs required
         F = Sum of sizes of I/O buffers required for all files
         G = Round up figure to make total a multiple of 2048 bytes.

                            P1000300 UTILITY PROGRAM

   Example 4

             In  this example, each record in the input data set that co
   the characters 'XYZ' in any byte is extracted  to  the  output  file.
   extraction test is made on  each input record.

         The EXEC statement:  invokes the P1000300 program.

         The  SYSUT1 DD statement:  defines the input data which is cata

         SYSIN DD statement:  defines the control statement file which
                              specifies extraction of records containing
                              the characters XYZ in any position.

         The SYSUT2 DD statement:  defines the output file of selected
                                   records, if any.
