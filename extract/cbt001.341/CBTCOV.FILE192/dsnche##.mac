GENERAL:

    This command checks for the existence of a catalog entry for
    a given dataset name.  If a member name is selected, DSNCHECK
    will open the dataset to check for the existence of the
    member.  If the name/member exists, the return code will be
    00.  If not, the code will be 12.  In this way, you can check
    for the existence of a dataset name or member before trying
    to allocate it in a CLIST.

DIRECTORY:

    This PDS contains the following members relating to DSNCHECK:

    DSNCDOC  - This documentation.
    DSNCJCL  - Non-SMP install jobstream.
    #DSNCHEC - HELP member.
    #DSNC    - Alias for HELP member.  Needed for IEBCOPY in
               the non-SMP install.
    DSNCCPY  - IEBCOPY control cards.  Used in non-SMP install.
    DSNCLNK  - LKED control cards.  Used in non-SMP install.
    DSNCHECK - Source program.

    GTEDAALC - Dynamic allocation macro, described below.
    GTEDADAT - Dynamic allocation macro, described below.
    GTEDADOC - Documentation for dynamic allocation macros,
               described below.
    GTEDASET - Dynamic allocation macro, described below.

INSTALLATION CHECK LIST:

(  )  1.  The following non-IBM macros are used to assemble
          DSNCHECK.  If you already have older versions in your
          system, replace them with the ones from this PDS.

            GTEDAALC - Execute SVC99 and IKJEFF18 (DAIRFAIL).
            GTEDADAT - Create SVC99/IKJEFF18 control blocks.
            GTEDASET - Link SVC99/IKJEFF18 control blocks together.

(  )  2.  The following macro is documentation for the GTEDAxxx
          macros, above.  It is not used by DSNCHECK, but should
          be copied into your system.

            GTEDADOC - Documentation of GTEDAxxx macros.

(  )  3.  Browse source member DSNCHECK of this PDS.  It contains
          general information about the module.

(  )  4.  For a non-SMP install, run the jobstream in member
          DSNCJCL of this PDS.  Recommended load libraries are:

          A.  SYS1.CMDLIB
          B.  library named on the LNKLST

          Add a JOB card at the top, and edit the last few lines
          to provide the name of the selected load library, HELP
          library, and the name of this PDS.

          The jobstream does the following:

          A.  Assembles DSNCHECK using the source in member
              DSNCHECK of this PDS. Note: Access to SYS1.AMODGEN
              is required because DSNCHECK uses the CVT macro.

          B.  Linkedits DSNCHECK into the selected load library,
              assigning an alias of DSNC.  Attributes are RENT,
              REUS and REFR.

          C.  IEBCOPYs member #DSNCHECK and alias entry #DSNC to the
              selected HELP library, renaming them DSNCHECK and
              DSNC.

(  )      For an SMP install, follow your installation's procedures
          for installation of a RENT, REUS, REFR module into
          LPALIB, LINKLIB, CMDLIB, or another library on the
          LNKLST, with the HELP member being installed as a
          ++MAC into HELP or another library in the SYSHELP
          concatenation.   The ++MOD entry should have TALIAS(DSNC),
          and the ++MAC entry should have MALIAS(DSNC).

(  )  5.  If you select SYS1.LPALIB as your target library, you
          will need to IPL, including 'CLPA' in the response to
          the system parameters prompt.  This will create a new
          LPA, picking up your DSNCHECK and DSNC alias in the
          process.

(  )      If you have Dynamic BLDL, and already have a version
          of DSNCHECK installed, you will have to stop and restart
          the Dynamic BLDL table.

          If you have ACF2 and are using command limiting lists,
          and are not already running a version of DSNCHECK, you
          must do one of the following:

(  )      A.  Turn the ALLCMDS bit on in the LOGONID of selected
              users, and invoke DSNCHECK with the '#' prefix.
              That is, use the alias name #DSNC.  This limits the
              use of DSNCHECK only to those LOGONIDs with the
              ALLCMDS bit on.  Turn the bit on with the following
              sequence from TSO READY state using a LOGONID with
              appropriate authority to change the bit.

                   ACF
                   LIST logonid
                   CHANGE * ALLCMDS
                   END

(  )      B.  Add the following macro to the command limiting
              list, then assemble, link, and IPL with CLPA.  This
              makes DSNCHECK available to everyone.

                   $TSOCMD  (DSNCHECK,DSNC)
