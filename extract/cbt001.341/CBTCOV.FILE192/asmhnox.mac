*
* THIS ZAP FIXES THE 'NOXREF' PROBLEM IN THE H ASSEMBLER.
*
* THE ZAP WAS DEVELOPED BY:
*  BILL GODFREY
*  PRC (PLANNING RESEARCH CORPORATION), MCLEAN VA
*  FOR THE AIR FORCE DATA SERVICES CENTER, PENTAGON, WASHINGTON DC.
*
* DATE WRITTEN: JULY 23 1981.
*
* THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE ASSEMBLER TREATS NOXREF AS XREF(FULL).
* THE PROBLEM WAS INTRODUCED WHEN THE LAST PTF LEVEL (21) OF
* ASSEMBLER-H REMOVED TWO INSTRUCTIONS IN IEV00 SO THAT 'XREF'
* WOULD BE TREATED AS 'XREF(FULL)'.  THIS CHANGE UNFORTUNATELY
* INTRODUCED A NEW BUG, I.E. 'NOXREF' IS TREATED AS 'XREF(FULL)'
*
* THE PROBLEM IS AT A COMPARE INSTRUCTION AT OFFSET 0186 IN IEV00.
* REGISTER 1 IS POINTING TO A 10 BYTE FIELD IN WHICH THE WORD
* 'XREF' OR 'NOXREF' (IN INTERNAL CHARACTER FORMAT) IS RIGHT
* JUSTIFIED WITH LEADING HEX ZEROS.  THE BRANCH INSTRUCTION AT
* OFFSET 0186 WILL BE TAKEN IF THE RIGHTMOST 4 BYTES ARE 'XREF'
* AND REGISTER 11 IS ALSO POINTING TO 'XREF' IN A TABLE.
* THE PERSON AT IBM WHO DID THE CODE APPARENTLY DID NOT REALIZE
* THAT IF THE RIGHTMOST 6 BYTES ARE 'NOXREF', THAT MEANS THE
* RIGHTMOST 4 BYTES ARE 'XREF'.
*
* THIS ZAP INTRODUCES A BRANCH TO AN EXTRA COMPARE IN THE PATCH AREA,
* WHICH WILL INSURE THAT THERE ARE NO MORE THAT 4 CHARACTERS, SO
* THAT 'NOXREF' WILL NOT BE MISTAKEN FOR 'XREF'.
*
* THERE IS NO VERIFY FOR THE PATCH AREA CONTENTS BECAUSE THEY ARE
* UNPREDICTABLE.
