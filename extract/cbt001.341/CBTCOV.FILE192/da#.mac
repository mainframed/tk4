)F FUNCTION -

The DA command will display the running jobs in the system

)X SYNTAX -
     DA

ALIAS    - NONE
REQUIRED - (none..there are no operands to the command)

  DA will produce an output in the form:

 Jobname  Stepname Procstep Status step-time Step-cpu

Where:

 Jobname  -  is the jobname of the job. (//jobname JOB ...)
 Stepname -  is the name of the step on the EXEC PGM= or
             EXEC PROC= card.
 Procstep -  is the name of the step within a PROC if the EXEC
             was of a PROC and not a Program.
 Status   -  is a 2 part field in the form:  xx aaaa

             xx = current memory (job/user) status
             IN =  user in core and executing
             NS =  user in core and is non/swappable
             PR =  user in core and is in supervisor state
             WT =  user is swapped out due to WAIT
             S  =  user is swapped out
             <> =  user is being swapped in or out

          aaaa  =  swap reason code for memory (job/user)
          TPUT  =  Terminal output wait swap-out.
          TGET  =  Terminal input wait swap-out.
          LONG  =  Long wait caused swap-out.
          PGS<  =  Auxiliary Storgage (paging space) shortage swap-out.
          RSS<  =  Real Storage pageable pool shortage swap-out.
          WAIT  =  Main Storage Occupancy detected WAIT swap-out.
          RQSW  =  REQSWAP SYSEVENT caused swap-out.
          DENQ  =  CAP Enqueue exchange Swap-out.
          EXCH  =  CAP exchange swap based on recommendation values.
          SWAP  =  CAP unilateral swap-out.

 step-time - is the elapsed time of the step from initiation.
 Step-cpu  - is the number of CPU seconds used by the current step.

)O OPERANDS -
   There are no operands to the DA command.
