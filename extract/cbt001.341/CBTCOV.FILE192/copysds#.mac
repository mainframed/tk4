)F FUNCTION -
   THE COPYSDS COMMAND COPIES A SEQUENTIAL DATA SET TO ANOTHER
   SEQUENTIAL DATA SET.

   IT CAN ALSO COPY A MEMBER OF A PDS, BUT WHEN COPYING ONE MEMBER
   TO ANOTHER THE DIRECTORY INFORMATION IS NOT COPIED, SO A LOAD
   MODULE COPIED WITH THIS COMMAND WOULD NOT BE EXECUTABLE.
   SEE THE COPYPDS COMMAND FOR COPYING ONE OR MORE MEMBERS FROM ONE
   PDS TO ANOTHER.

   BOTH DATA SETS MUST EXIST BEFOREHAND - THIS COMMAND DOES NOT
   ALLOCATE A NEW DATA SET.

                IUNIT('UNIT NAME') IVOLUME('INPUT VOLSER')
                OUNIT('UNIT NAME') OVOLUME('OUTPUT VOLSER')
                MAX('NUMBER')  BYPASS('NUMBER')   OLD/SHR

     REQUIRED -  'DSNAME1'  'DSNAME2'

))IVOLUME   - VOLUME SERIAL OF INPUT VOLUME
))OUNIT     - UNIT OF OUTPUT DATASET
))OVOLUME   - VOLUME SERIAL OF OUTPUT VOLUME
))NUM       - SEQUENCE NUMBERS ARE PRESENT
