                     RELEASE  24.0     1  APRIL   1989

              COURTESY     JIM MARSHALL, CAPT, USAF

             THIS IS A COLLECTION OF TSO CP'S FROM MANY SOURCES.IT IS
            MY INTENT TO PUT TOGETHER A FILE OF TSO CP'S FOR SHARE. SOME
            SOME ARE ORIGINAL AND MOST WERE OBTAINED FROM MY OS/MVT DAYS
            AND CONVERTED. IT'S EMBARRASSING TO TELL MANAGEMENT THAT
            USERS HAVE LOST FUNCTIONS MIGRATING TO MVS. HOPEFULLY I CAN
            BECOME A FOCAL POINT FOR TSO CP'S. ALSO I HAVE ISPF/PDF AND
            BUT AM REQUIRED TO SUPPORT 300-1200 BAUD ASYNC TERMINALS.
            THUS TO KEEP THOSE PEOPLE HAPPY AND RELATIVELY PRODUCTIVE I
            MUST BE CONCERNED WITH THINGS OUTSIDE OF THE WONDEROUS SPF.
            I WILL BE ADDING MORE TO THIS FILE AS TIME PROGRESSES.

                     D I S C L A I M E R     !!!!!
                 *************************************
               USE ALL OF THESE AT YOUR OWN RISK, NATURALLY!
                 *************************************

           THE FILE IS CONSTRUCTED OF MEMBERS AS FOLLOWS: THE SOURCE IS
           PUT IN AS A NAME, THEN THE HELP IS SUFFIXED WITH A #
           SIGN, AND THE THE JCL TO INSTALL IS SUFFIXED WITH A $ SIGN.

           FOR EXAMPLE:   CMD     - SOURCE MEMBER
                          CMD#    - HELP ENTRY
                          CMD$    - JCL TO INSTALL

            NOTE:
            MANY OF THESE MODULES HAVE THE CSECT STACKED TOGETHER, LOOK
            AT THE JCL INSTALL MEMBER TO SEE IF THERE A 'PARM=BATCH' IN
            COMPILE. IF YOU ONLY HAVE ASMF THEN YOU MAY HAVE TO BREAK
            THE CODE APART SINCE ASMF DOES NOT SUPPORT BATCH COMPILES !

            NOTE:
            MANY OF THESE WILL RUN AS IS UNDER MVT, SOME HAVE A
            COMPILE CODE THAT LETS YOU SET IT FOR MVS OR MVT. NEAT!

            NOTE:
            IF YOU INSTALL A COMD WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE CODE, AND IF
            TRY TO USE IT, IT MAY COME BACK WITH ' COMMAND NOT FOUND '.
            IT IS PROBABLY BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME CHECKING FOR SECURITY
            THAT LOOKS AT THE TSOID. THEREFORE IF IT ISN'T A MATCH WE
            XCTL TO THE SAME MODULE THAT WILL YIELD 'COMMAND NOT FOUND'
            CONFUSES THE HECK OUT OF PEOPLE WHO OVERHEAR A WORD AND ARE
            SLICK ENOUGH TO COPY THE CMD ELSEWHERE !!!!!

            NOTE:
            THE JCL YOU MAY SEE IN THE INSTALLATION OF THE TSO CP'S
            MAY LOOK STRANGE. ALL IT IS BASICALLY THE COMPILE AND
            LKED STEPS (ASMFCL OR ASMHCL). IT MAY LOOK A BIT DIFFERENT
            BUT IT IS REALLY NOT. WE HAVE AN IBM 3800 AND ROTATE THE
            PRINT. THAT IS WHY THE PROC IS DIFFERENT FROM THE STANDARD.
            THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE JCL IS TO SEE WHAT MEMBERS
            ARE INPUTTED AND THE LKED EDIT ATTRIBUTES OF THE MODULE.

            NOTE:
            IF YOU INSTALL THE TSO SUBCOMMANDS OF EDIT, YOU
            SHOULD READ THE TSO SPL. WE CALLED OUR MODULES IKJXXXXX
            NOT TO MEAN THESE ARE IBM MODULES BUT TO IDENTITY THEM TO
            US AS TSO CP'S OF EDIT. ALSO REMEMBER YOU HAVE TO UPDATE
            'IKJEBMA9' EDIT SUBCOMMAND TABLE. READ THE SPL ON IT. IT IS
            CONFUSING BECAUSE A SUBCMD CAN HAVE MANY NAMES AND DO NOT
            HAVE TO MATCH THE MEMBER NAME IN THE LOAD MODULE LIBRARY.
            DO NOT PANIC IF IT LOOKS LIKE MAGIC, JUST GO TO THE SPL.

            NOTE:

            MUST GIVE A SPECIAL NOTE OF THANKS TO MR. BILL GODFREY FROM
            PLANNING RESEARCH CORPORATION (PRC). HE WAS A CONTRACTOR
            ASSIGNED TO ME AND HE IS A TSO WIZARD. HE HAS WRITTEN A LOT
            OF THE TSO COMMANDS AND IMPROVED UPON OTHERS.

            NOTE:
            CONVERTED THE $$PROSE MEMBER INTO INFOSYS FORMAT.

                 ADDED SOME NOTES IN THE SECTIONS ABOVE, PLSE READ FOR
                 THERE HAS BEEN SOME CALLS WITH QUESTIONS.

          10 JAN 85 - GOT SOME TSO CP'S FROM CHUCK HOFFMAN, GTE LABS.
                      I AM INCORPORATING THEM INTO MY FILE. ALSO I
                      NEED TO REPACKAGE THEM IN MY SCHEME. THANKS FOR
                      ALOT OF WORK BY CHUCK. ALL SHOULD LOOK AT THE
                      'GTEMACS' MEMBER FOR SOME GOOD MACROS THAT USE
                      SVC 99. HAD TO ALTER SOME OF THE NAMES BECAUSE
                      OF CONFLICTS.

           5 SEP 82 - I HAVE BEEN INSTALLING ALOT OF MY GOODIES THAT I
                      BROUGHT FROM THE PENTAGON AND THEREFORE I AM
                      ADDING ALOT OF JCL BECAUSE I AM INSTALLING
                      YOU PEOPLE HAVE TO DO TO INSTALL. YOU MAY NOTE I
                      HAVE BEEN ADDING ALIGN TO THE ASMH PARMS. THIS IS
                      BECAUSE THE ASMH COMPILER WAS GENERATED WITH
                      NOALIGN.

          20 MAY 82 - MAJOR CHANGE, HOW I PACKAGE THE FILES. THE MACROS
                      FOR THIS FILE ARE NOW IN THIS FILE. THE MACRO HAS
                      DISAPPEARED.

          10 OCT 86 - AS I INSTALL ON AN MVS/XA SYSTEM, I WILL NOTE THE
                      FACT IN THE RELEASE FIELD. SAY YOU SEE A  1X IN
                      FIELD MEANS 'REL 1 - RUNS IN MVS/XA FINE'.  THUS
                      X     - RUNS FINE FROM MVS/SP TO MVS/XA NO CHNGE.
                      Y     - RUNS ONLY MVS/SP AND I WILL NOT PURSUE THE
                              CHANGES TO MVS/XA, YOU ARE WELCOME TO DO
                              IT AND WOULD APPRECIATE THE CODE.
                      N     - ONLY RUNS IN MVS/SP, NEEDS TO BE CONVERTED
                      Z     - RUNS NOW IN MVS/XA BUT WAS CONVERTED AND
                              IF YOU WANT IT TO WORK IN MVS/SP YOU NEED
                              TO CHANGE A COND ASSEMBLY.
                      BLANK - NEEDS TO BE DETERMINED, WILL GET TO IT.
