GENERAL:

  The INSTREAM command is used to create 80-byte control card
  images in a temporary file.  This command can be run under
  CLIST control, with symbolic substitution of variables allowed.
  INSTREAM uses VIO instead of datasets, and uses system
  generated names instead of cataloging.

  Syntax -

    INSTREAM   DDNAME(name)  END(string)  CAPS  NOTIFY
    IN           FILE(name)               ASIS  NONOTIFY

INSTALLATION CHECK LIST:

(  )  1.  The following non-IBM macros are used to assemble
          INSTREAM. If you already have older versions in your
          system, replace them with the ones from this PDS.

            EQ$R     - Register equates.
            GTEDAALC - Execute SVC99 and IKJEFF18 (DAIRFAIL).
            GTEDADAT - Create SVC99/IKJEFF18 control blocks.
            GTEDASET - Link SVC99/IKJEFF18 control blocks together.
            LINKBACK - Linkage conventions out.
            LINKSAVE - Linkage conventions in.

(  )  2.  The following macro is documentation for the GTEDAxxx
          macros, above.  It is not used by INSTREAM, but should
          be copied into your system.

            GTEDADOC - Documentation of GTEDAxxx macros.

(  )  3.  For a non-SMP install, run the jobstream in member
          INJCL of this PDS.  Recommended load libraries are:

          A.  SYS1.CMDLIB
          B.  library named on the LNKLST

          Add a JOB card at the top, and edit the last few lines
          to provide the name of the selected load library, HELP
          library, and the name of this PDS.

          The jobstream does the following:

          A.  Assembles INSTREAM using the source in member
              INSTREAM of this PDS.

              Note: Access to SYS1.AMODGEN is required because
                    INSTREAM uses the CVT macro.

          B.  Linkedits INSTREAM into the selected load library,
              assigning an alias of IN.  Attributes are RENT,
              REUS and REFR.

          C.  IEBCOPYs member #INSTREA and alias entry #IN to the
              selected HELP library, renaming them INSTREAM and
              IN.

(  )      For an SMP install, follow your installation's procedures
          for installation of a RENT, REUS, REFR module into
          LPALIB, LINKLIB, CMDLIB, or another library on the
          LNKLST, with the HELP member being installed as a
          ++MAC into HELP or another library in the SYSHELP
          concatenation.   The ++MOD entry should have TALIAS(IN),
          and the ++MAC entry should have MALIAS(IN).

(  )  4.  If you select SYS1.LPALIB as your target library, you
          will need to IPL, including 'CLPA' in the response to
          the system parameters prompt.  This will create a new
          LPA, picking up your INSTREAM and IN alias in the
          process.

(  )      If you have Dynamic BLDL, and already have a version
          of INSTREAM installed, you will have to stop and restart
          the Dynamic BLDL table.

(  )      If you have ACF2 and are using command limiting lists,
          and are not already running a version of INSTREAM, you
          must do either one of the following:

          A.  Turn the ALLCMDS bit on in the LOGONID of selected
              users, and invoke INSTREAM with the '#' prefix.
              That is, use the alias name #IN. This limits the
              use of INSTREAM only to those LOGONIDs with the
              ALLCMDS bit on.  Turn the bit on with the following
              sequence from TSO READY state using a LOGONID with
              appropriate authority to change the bit.

                   ACF
                   LIST logonid
                   CHANGE * ALLCMDS
                   END

          B.  Add the following macro to the command limiting
              list, then assemble, link, and IPL with CLPA.  This
              makes INSTREAM available to everyone.

                   $TSOCMD  (INSTREAM,IN)
