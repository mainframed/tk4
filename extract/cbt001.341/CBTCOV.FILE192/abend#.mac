     UPDATE A PARTITIONED DATASET. REGION SIZE IS TOO SMALL.
))SB37 - AT END OF VOLUME, THE VOLUME MUST BE DEMOUNTED, BUT THE SYSTEM
         IS UNABLE TO DISMOUNT THE VOLUME.

   ***SB37 OPERAND FOR MORE SPECIFIC INFORMATION: H ABEND O(SB37-RC)**
   --POSSIBLE CAUSE--
     THE DATA SET ON DASD - OUTPUT - ALREADY HAD 16 EXTENTS, BUT
         REQUIRED MORE SPACE - SECONDARY SPACE WAS TOO SMALL
     NO MORE SPACE WAS AVAILABLE ON THE VOLUME
     THE VOLUME TABLE OF CONTENTS WAS FULL
))SB37-04 - DURING END-OF-VOLUME PROCESSING THE SYSTEM HAD TO DEMOUNT
     A VOLUME IN ORDER TO MOUNT THE NEXT VOLUME OF THE DATASET. IT WAS
     UNABLE TO DEMOUNT THE VOLUME FOR ONE OF THE FOLLOWING REASONS:
     - THE VOLUME WAS PERMANENTLY RESIDENT OR WAS RESERVED.
     - ANOTHER JOB HAD DATASETS ALLOCATED ON THE VOLUME.
     - THE FAILING TASK HAD OPEN DATASETS ON THE VOLUME.
     FOR AN OUTPUT DATASET ON A DIRECT ACCESS DEVICE:
     - NO MORE SPACE WAS AVAILABLE ON THE VOLUME.
     - THE DATASET ALREADY HAD 16 EXTENTS BUT REQUIRED MORE SPACE.
     - MORE SPACE WAS REQUIRED, BUT THE VTOC WAS FULL.
     FOR AN OUTPUT DATASET ON MAGNETIC TAPE:
     - A VOLUME NEEDED TO BE DEMOUNTED BECAUSE THE REFLECTIVE SPOT
       WAS ENCOUNTERED AND MORE RECORDS NEEDED TO BE WRITTEN, BUT
       THE LIMIT OF OUTPUT TAPES HAD BEEN REACHED.
))SB37-08 - DURING END-OF-VOLUME PROCESSING THE SYSTEM ATTEMPTED TO
     EXTEND THE DATASET TO A VOLUME ON WHICH THE DIRF BIT WAS SET.
     THE VTOC FOR THE VOLUME COULD NOT BE CONVERTED TO THE STANDARD
     FORMAT FOR ONE OF THE FOLLOWING REASONS:
     - TWO DATASETS WERE ALLOCATED TO THE SAME SPACE ON THE VOLUME.
     - A SLPIT CYLINDER DATASET WAS LOCATED ON THE SAME CYLINDER AS
       A NON-SPLIT CYLINDER DATASET.
     - THE VTOC CONVERSION ROUTINE IS SET TO REJECT DIRF REQUESTS.
))SB37-0C - THE MOUNTED DIRECT ACCESS VOLUME WAS REQUESTED TO CONTINUE
     PROCESSING THE DATASET, BUT THE UNIT ALREADY CONTAINED THE
     MAXIMUM OF 127 CONCURRENT USERS.
))SC03 - A DATA SET COULD NOT BE CLOSED BY THE CONTROL PROGRAM, BECAUSE
         THE DCB HAD BEEN ERRONEOUSLY MODIFIED.
     ISAM FILE - BAD BLOCK SIZE
))SC13 - THE ERROR OCCURRED DURING THE EXECUTION OF AN OPEN MACRO FOR
     A CONCATENATED PARTITIONED OR GRAPHICS DATASET.
   ***IF THE REGISTER 15 RETURN CODE IS AVAILABLE, SUPPLY IT IN THE***
   ***SC13 OPERAND FOR MORE SPECIFIC INFORMATION: H ABEND O(SC13-RC)**
   --POSSIBLE CAUSE--
     ATTEMPED TO WRITE OUTPUT TO CONCATENATED PARTITIONED DATASETS
     MISSING OR DELETED JOBLIB DATA SET
     GRAPHICS - SYSTEM PROBLEM - WAIT FOR IPL
))SC13-04 - THE CURRENT TASK TRIED TO OPEN A GRAPHICS DEVICE THAT WAS
     PREVIOUSLY OPENED AND NOT CLOSED.
))SC13-10 - AN OPEN MACRO WAS ISSUED SPECIFYING OUTPUT OR EXTEND FOR
     A CONCATENATED PARTITIONED DATASET. OUTPUT DATASETS CANNOT BE
     CONCATENATED.

))SD13 - OPEN FOR GRAPHICS - DCB FOR OTHER THAN GRAPHICS DEVICE
))SD23 - THE ERROR OCCURRED DURING THE EXECUTION OF A WTO OR WTOR MACRO
     FOR ONE OF THE FOLLOWING REASONS:
     - THE PARAMETER LIST SUPPLIED TO THE WTOR MACRO DOES NOT BEGIN ON
       A FULLWORD BOUNDARY.
     - A WTOR/MLWTO PARAMATER LIST WAS SPECIFIED.
     - A MULTILINE WTO WAS SPECIFIED AND SPACE WAS NOT AVAILABLE IN
       SUBPOOL 229 FOR A WORKAREA FOR SVC 35.
     - THE PARAMETER LIST PASSED BY THE USER DOES NOT RESIDE IN STORAGE
       THAT IS ACCESSIBLE BY THE USER.
     - SPACE WAS NOT AVAILABLE IN SUBPOOL 231 FOR AN ORE OR WQE BUFFER.

))SD37-04 - (04 IS THE ONLY POSSIBLE RETURN CODE ASSOCIATED WITH SD37)
     A DATASET OPENED FOR OUTPUT USED ALL THE PRIMARY SPACE, AND NO
     SECONDARY SPACE WAS REQUESTED. EITHER SPECIFY A LARGER PRIMARY
     QUANTITY OR ADD A SECONDARY QUANTITY TO THE REQUEST.
))SE37 - THE ERROR OCCURRED DURING END OF VOLUME PROCESSING WHEN AN
     OUTPUT OPERATION WAS REQUESTED FOR A DATASET.
   ***IF THE REGISTER 15 RETURN CODE IS AVAILABLE, SUPPLY IT IN THE***
   ***SE37 OPERAND FOR MORE SPECIFIC INFORMATION: H ABEND O(SE37-RC)**
   --POSSIBLE CAUSE--
     RAN OUT OF DIRECTORY SPACE IN A PDS
     OUTPUT EXCEEDED VOLUME COUNT
))SE37-04 - A DATASET OPENED FOR OUTPUT USED ALL SPACE AVAILABLE ON
     THE CURRENT VOLUME, AND NO MORE VOLUMES WERE AVAILABLE:
     - NOT ENOUGH VOLUMES WERE SPECIFIED FOR THE DATASET THROUGH THE
       'SER', VOLUME COUNT, OR 'REF' SUBPARAMETER OF THE VOLUME
       PARAMETER. WHEN ALL THE VOLUMES WERE FILLED, THE PROGRAM
       ATTEMPTED TO WRITE ANOTHER RECORD.
     - FOR A PARTITIONED DATASET ON A DIRECT ACCESS VOLUME, ALL SPACE
       WAS FILLED WHEN THE PROGRAM ATTEMPTED TO WRITE ANOTHER RECORD.
       (A PARTITIONED DATASET CAN RESIDE ON ONLY ONE VOLUME.)
     - FOR A PARTITIONED DATASET ON A DIRECT ACCESS VOLUME, 16 EXTENTS
       HAD BEEN USED WHEN THE PROGRAM ATTEMPTED TO WRITE ANOTHER
       RECORD; HOWEVER, NO VOLUME WAS AVAILABLE FOR DEMOUNTING.
))SE37-08 - ON A DATASET OPENED FOR OUTPUT, END-OF-VOLUME HAD FOUND
     A DSCB WITH A DUPLICATE DATASET NAME ON THE NEXT VOLUME, WITH A
     VOLUME SEQUENCE NUMBER LESS THAN THAT IN THE DEB.
     - A MULTI-VOLUME PHYSICAL SEQUENTIAL DATASET WAS BEING WRITTEN
       ON A DIRECT ACCESS DEVICE. ALL SPACE WAS FILLED ON A VOLUME,
       AND AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO OBTAIN SPACE ON THE NEXT SPECIFIED
       VOLUME. EITHER THE SPACE WAS NOT AVAILABLE ON THAT VOLUME OR THE
       DATASET ALREADY EXISTED ON THAT VOLUME.
