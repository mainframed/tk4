GENERAL:

    This command is a new version of FREEALL which utilizes SVC99
    to unallocate files.  This version has the advantage of using
    all IBM supported code.  SVC99 does all the dealing with the
    TIOT, etc., so that this program can be maintained by more
    junior systems programmers.  This version also allows the
    designation of masks for installation excepted DDNAMEs,
    instead of just explicit names.

    The user is able to supply a list of DDNAMEs and/or masks to
    be excepted from the unallocation process.  The user can also
    choose whether to unallocate concatenations, and whether to
    unallocate datasets not dynamically allocated (useful when
    running TSO in batch, or when you need to free datasets
    allocated during LOGON).  The user can also see a list of the
    default installation masks/DDNAMEs which will always be
    excepted from the unallocations.

INSTALLATION CHECK LIST:

(  )  1.  The following non-IBM macros are used to assemble
          FREEALL.  If you already have older versions in your
          system, replace them with the ones from this PDS.

            EQ$R     - Register equates.
            GTEDAALC - Execute SVC99 and IKJEFF18 (DAIRFAIL).
            GTEDADAT - Create SVC99/IKJEFF18 control blocks.
            GTEDASET - Link SVC99/IKJEFF18 control blocks together.
            LINKBACK - Linkage conventions out.
            LINKSAVE - Linkage conventions in.

(  )  2.  The following macro is documentation for the GTEDAxxx
          macros, above.  It is not used by FREEALL, but should
          be copied into your system.

            GTEDADOC - Documentation of GTEDAxxx macros.

(  )  3.  Edit source member FREEALL of this PDS.  It contains
          general information about the module.  Add EXNAM
          macros as desired to define masks of DDNAMEs which
          your installation will except from processing.  The
          following examples show the use of the EXNAM macro:

          A.  To permanently except file names SYSIN and SYSOUT
              from processing:

                      EXNAM  SYSIN
                      EXNAM  SYSOUT

          B.  To permanently except ANY file name beginning with
              'ISP' (ISPF files) and any 6-character file name
              beginning with 'PANDD' (Panvalet files):

                      EXNAM  ISP-
                      EXNAM  PANDD*

              Note: '*' is a placeholder.
                    '-' means anything is a match from that
                        point on.

          C.  To permanently except ANY file name containing the
              letter 'T' in the third position:

                      EXNAM  **T-

          Several DDNAME masks are already in the source code.
          Modify the list to suit your installation's needs.  The
          list is searched sequentially.  Those file names most
          often used should be placed at the top of the list.

(  )  4.  For a non-SMP install, run the jobstream in member
          FAJCL of this PDS.  Recommended load libraries are:

          A.  SYS1.LPALIB
          B.  SYS1.LINKLIB
          C.  SYS1.CMDLIB
          D.  library named on the LNKLST

          Add a JOB card at the top, and edit the last few lines
          to provide the name of the selected load library, HELP
          library, and the name of this PDS.

          The jobstream does the following:

          A.  Assembles FREEALL using the source in member
              FREEALL of this PDS.  Note: Access to SYS1.AMODGEN
              is required because FREEALL uses the CVT macro.

          B.  Linkedits FREEALL into the selected load library,
              assigning an alias of FA.  Attributes are RENT,
              REUS and REFR.

          C.  IEBCOPYs member #FREEALL and alias entry #FA to the
              selected HELP library, renaming them FREEALL and
              FA.

(  )      For an SMP install, follow your installation's procedures
          for installation of a RENT, REUS, REFR module into
          LPALIB, LINKLIB, CMDLIB, or another library on the
          LNKLST, with the HELP member being installed as a
          ++MAC into HELP or another library in the SYSHELP
          concatenation.   The ++MOD entry should have TALIAS(FA),
          and the ++MAC entry should have MALIAS(FA).

(  )  5.  If you select SYS1.LPALIB as your target library, you
          will need to IPL, including 'CLPA' in the response to
          the system parameters prompt.  This will create a new
          LPA, picking up your FREEALL and FA alias in the
          process.

(  )      If you have Dynamic BLDL, and already have a version
          of FREEALL installed, you will have to stop and restart
          the Dynamic BLDL table.

          If you have ACF2 and are using command limiting lists,
          and are not already running a version of FREEALL, you
          must do one of the following:

(  )      A.  Turn the ALLCMDS bit on in the LOGONID of selected
              users, and invoke FREEALL with the '#' prefix.
              That is, use the name #FREEALL or alias #FA.  This
              limits the use of FREEALL only to those LOGONIDs
              with the ALLCMDS bit on.  Turn the bit on with the
              following sequence from TSO READY state using a
              LOGONID with appropriate authority to change the
              bit.

                   ACF
                   LIST logonid
                   CHANGE * ALLCMDS
                   END

(  )      B.  Add the following macro to the command limiting
              list, then assemble, link, and IPL with CLPA.  This
              makes FREEALL available to everyone.

                   $TSOCMD  (FREEALL,FA)
