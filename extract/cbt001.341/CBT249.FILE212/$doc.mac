×   THE PURPOSE OF THE JOBS IN THIS PDS  IS TO PRESENT EXAMPLES     ×
×   AS TO HOW SAS MAY BE UTILIZED TO ACCOMPLISH THE REDUCTION OF    ×
×   SMF DATA AND PERFORM SOME ELEMENTARY ANALYSIS ON THAT DATA.     ×
×   ALTHOUGH THE JOBS WILL PERFORM CORRECTLY IN THEIR CURRENT       ×
×   FORMAT, IT IS SUGGESTED THAT THEY BE UTILIZED ONLY AS A         ×
×   GUIDELINE. THE FLEXIBILITY OF SAS IS SUCH THAT IT WOULD BE      ×
×   EASY TO TAILOR REPORTS IN ORDER TO SUIT THE NEEDS OF THE        ×
×   INDIVIDUAL INSTALLATIION.                                       ×
×                                                                   ×

×   IT IS STRONGLY SUGGESTED THAT ONE HAVE A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING ×
×   OF THE PROGRAMS BEFORE UTILIZATION.  BECAUSE EACH INSTALLATION  ×
×   POSSESSES ITS OWN UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS, THESE PROGRAMS ARE       ×
×   INTENDED TO DEMONSTRATE THE FLEXIBILITY AND CAPABILITY OF SAS   ×
×   IN THE ANALYSIS OF SMF DATA. RATHER THAN BEING UTILIZED IN ITS  ×
×   CURRENT FORM, THEY SERVE AS A STARTING POINT FOR THE            ×
×   DEVELOPMENT OF FACILITIES THAT BEST SUIT THE INDIVIDUAL         ×
×   INSTALLATION                                                    ×
