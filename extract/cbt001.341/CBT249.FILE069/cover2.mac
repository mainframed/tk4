                  MODS FOR SUPPORT OF MOD 4 3278's ON TCAM 10

       IBM provides support 3276 and 3278 Mod 4 displays with a full
       (43,80) screen in ACF TCAM, but users of TCAM at levels 10 and
       below are limited to the (24,80) screensize. As the capability
       to display more lines is very attractive and useful in many app-
       lications, we decided to look into the possiblility of modifying
       our current TCAM to provide this support.

       After some intensive work at the microfiche viewer, we generated
       a series of mods which support 3278 Mod 4 terminals with (43,80)
       screen capability with:

           (1) Both Remotes and Locals
           (2) A mixture of 3277 and 3278 Mod 2 terminals (both 24 lines
                      in addition to the Mod 4's
           (3) Fullscreen as well as non-fullscreen applications
           (4) Session Manager
           (5) SPF
           (6) TUCC's QED Editor with Applied Software's FSE Full-Screen
                      Editor

       The support depends upon the Screensize gened in TCAM for each
       tube so that it supports each type of terminal correctly. IBM's
       Session Manager required a minor modification to "turn on" its
       43-line support, but SPF and the latest version of FSE support
       both screensizes without change.

       The basic problem in using the 43-line screen is that the hardwar
       itself is equipped with both default (24,80) and alternate (43,80
       screensizes. The tube is in default mode when powered on and may
       be instructed to go into alternate screensize with an Erase/Write
       Alternate command.It will continue in this mode, accepting 43-lin
       output and input, and revert to the default screensize only when
       (a) it receives an ordinary Erase/Write, (b) is powered off and o
       or (c) CLEAR or TEST are pressed by the operator.

       Erase/Write is the command which erases the 3270 screen. It is se
       to the tube (a) whenever ENTER is hit after a bottom-of-screen pr
       during non-fullscreen TSO operations, (b) whenever CLEAR is enter
       from a terminal which is in TSO session, and (c) by some fullscre
       applications for the purpose of clearing the screen. (It should b
       noted that the screen can also be cleared by writing a screenful
       nulls. Some fullscreen applications use this approach.)

       The requirements for support of 43-line mode are:
          (1) To ensure that every Erase/Write sent by TCAM to a 43-line
              tube is an Erase/Write Alternate.
          (2) To ensure that Erase/Write commands issued by fullscreen
              applications are properly recognized and converted to the
              appropriate mode when necessary.
          (3) To get the terminal into 43 line mode at the beginning of
              the session. (Normally, the first Erase/Write in a TSO
              session occurs after the first bottom-of-screen prompt.)

       Two modifications are sufficient to support 43-line non-fullscree
       mode. They are:

       1. A zap to the TCAM module IEDAYM which causes all Erase/Writes
          generated by TCAM itself to be Erase/Write Alternate for tubes
          gened for 43 lines.

       2. An IKJEFLD Logon pre-prompt exit which issues the appropriate
          form of Erase/Write was a quick-and-easy way of initializing
          the session to 43-line mode. This works, but imperfectly.

          At Logon, the terminal is in a unique situation. It is fairly
          likely that the tube has either just been powered on or that
          CLEAR has been hit since the prior Logoff. This means that the
          tube is in 24-line mode. When the screen is reset after the
          first input (probably LOGON), an error is display occurs,
          requiring the user to hit RESET before the next input.

          The above support is sufficient for Fullscreen applications
          which either do not use Write/Erase at all or which use
          Write/Erase only (not Write/Erase Alternate.) In the case of
          "smart" fullscreen applications such as SPF and Session Manage
          three additional mods were required. These applications look a
          two new TSB fields for screensize. They issue their own screen
          erases, in accordance with size screen they are formatting.
          These applications called forthree additional modifications:

       3. IEDAYLL was modified to fill in the TSB Primary and Alternate
          screensize fields at Logon ONLY for those tubes gened as havin
          43 lines.

       4. IEDAY88 was modified to perform the above initialization of
          the TSB fields during Logon Reconnect.

       5. IEDAYQ scans TSO messages for the escape/command sequences in
          fullscreen TPUTs. It was modified to recognize the Erase/Write
          Alternate as well as the Erase/Write an to handle both properl
          for locals.

       Session Manager included code to look at the TSB Screensize field
          and to format its I/O for either 24 or 43-line screens. It
          lacked code to change a hard-coded default value of 24. This
          was remedied by another zap. SPF and the latest release of FSE
          work without change.

       We have been running with these mods for four months. The pressur
          of installing MVS 3.8 prevented further work on a fix for the
          single error during logon, but I hope to continue the effort
          now that the new system is up.
