            The attached modifications to TCAM 10 were applied using SMP
            to the IPO 6 TCAM 10 with the TCAM Level-Set PTF tape dist-
            ributed for the IPO 6 system.

            These mods are as we are currently running and do produce a
            PROG407 or PROG13 error during LOGON. There may also be loss
            of Alternate Screen Mode by the terminal in some situations
            if a Fullscreen Application is run WHICH ISSUES ERASE/WRITE
            commands and which is a purely 24-line application. Dependin
            on the FULLSCR or SPF macros used in the message handler, ex
            from such applications often produces a bottom-of-screen pro
            which will result in re-initialization of the tube to altern
            screensize automatically. Otherwise, it would be necessary t
            either modify the application or hit CLEAR after exiting ful
            screen mode.

            Since Share, I have done some additional work on eliminating
            both the PROG errors and the possible problem with 24-line
            fullscreen applications. I hope to complete and test this
            new version shortly and ,if I am successful, I will send out
            the corrected version.

            In answer to possible retrofitting of these mods to TCAM 9 -
            I have not researched this but believe that the modules in-
            volved have not changed substantially and that it would be
            possible. The modifications I make to (hopefully) eliminate
            the errors during LOGON may, however, depend on code which h
            been added recently. The Session Manager and SPF code for de
            termining screensize uses code in SVC 94 to obtain the Prima
            and Alternate screensize fields from the TSB. This is probab
            the code most likely to be missing from older versions.

            The mod to Session Manager causes assembly of both 24 and 43
            output modules and modifies S.M. to load the appropriate ver
            based on the screensize of the terminal.

            I would be interested in hearing about any problems encounte
            with these mods. Good luck!
