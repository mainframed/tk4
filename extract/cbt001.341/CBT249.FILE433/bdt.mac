)F FUNCTION-
   THE BDT COMMAND PROVIDES TSO ACCESS TO THE MVS/BDT (BULK DATA
   TRANSFER) WHICH PROVIDES FILE-TO-FILE DATA TRANSFERS WITHIN
   A NETWORK OF MVS/BDT NODES (OR LOCATIONS).
)X SYNTAX-

              PLICITLY IDENTIFY JOB INFORMATION KEYWORDS AND MVS/BDT
              COMMANDS.  THE REMAINING OPERAND DEFINITIONS ARE FOR
              DATA-SET-DESCRIPTION KEYWORDS.
            - ALL VALUES MUST BE SEPARATED BY BLANKS OR COMMAS.
            - PORTIONS OF THE "FROM" AND "TO" DEFINITIONS (GROUPS OF
              KEYWORDS) CAN BE ALTERNATED AS LONG AS EACH BEGINS WITH
              A "FROM" OR "TO" FOR IDENTIFICATION BY MVS/BDT. (THE FIRST
              "FROM" IS OPTIONAL.  SEE "FROM" AND "TO" DEFINITIONS FOR
              MORE INFORMATION.)

                   VALUES (IF ANY) WHICH ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS NAME
                   WILL BE MERGED WITH THE KEYWORD PARAMETERS TO CON-
                   STRUCT A COMPLETE MVS/BDT COMMAND. (ENTERED KEYWORDS
                   REPLACE ANY MATCHING ONES IN SKELETON.)
                   IF YOU DO NOT USE A VALID BDTXCODE, ENTER "Q" FOR
                   THIS POSITIONAL PARAMETER AND THEN ENTER ALL
                   NECESSARY KEYWORDS.
