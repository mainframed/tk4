)F FUNCTION -
   THE OUTPRINT COMMAND PRINTS A DATA SET CREATED BY THE
   OUTPUT COMMAND (OR ANY DATA SET CONTAINING CARRIAGE CONTROLS)
   TO A SYSOUT FILE.

   THE DATA SET DOES NOT HAVE TO BE MARKED WITH A RECFM INDICATING
   CARRIAGE CONTROLS (A OR M) BUT IT DOES HAVE TO HAVE CARRIAGE
   CONTROLS IN COLUMN 1 OF EACH RECORD.  THE CARRIAGE CONTROLS MAY
   BE EITHER ASA OR MACHINE OR A MIXTURE OF THE TWO (WHICH IS
   OFTEN THE CASE WHEN THE DATA SET IS CREATED BY THE OUTPUT COMMAND).

   SEE HELP FOR THE 'PRINTOFF' COMMAND FOR PRINTING OTHER TYPES OF
   DATA SETS.
)X SYNTAX -
     OUTPRINT  'DSNAME'  CLASS('CLASS') DEST('REMOTE')
              COPIES('NNN')  HOLD/NOHOLD
              OUTFILE('DDNAME')

     REQUIRED -  'DSNAME'
     ALIAS    -  NONE
     DEFAULTS -  CLASS(A), COPIES(1), NOHOLD
)O OPERANDS -
))'DSNAME'  - THE NAME OF THE DATA SET TO BE PRINTED.
))FILE      - THIS KEYWORD INDICATES THAT THE FIRST OPERAND
              IS A FILENAME (DDNAME), NOT A DATA SET NAME.
))CLASS('CLASS') - SYSOUT CLASS IN WHICH OUTPUT IS TO BE
            PRINTED.  DEFAULT IS A.
))COPIES('NNN') - NUMBER OF COPIES TO BE PRINTED.
            DEFAULT IS 1.
))DEST('REMOTE') - REMOTE LOCATION TO WHICH SYSOUT DATA SETS
            ARE TO BE ROUTED.
))HOLD      - OUTPUT IS TO BE PLACED ON A HOLD QUEUE UPON
            DEALLOCATION.
))OUTFILE('DDNAME') - IF YOU WISH THE COMMAND TO WRITE TO A
            DATA SET YOU HAVE PRE-ALLOCATED INSTEAD OF SYSOUT,
            SPECIFY THE DDNAME OF YOUR PRE-ALLOCATED DATA SET
            IN THE OUTFILE KEYWORD.  THE OUTPUT FILE HAS ALL
            ASA CARRIAGE CONTROLS, SO THIS IS A GOOD WAY TO
            CONVERT DATA FROM MACHINE TO ASA CARRIAGE CONTROLS
            WITHOUT PRINTING IT.  THE OUTFILE KEYWORD NULLIFIES
            THE CLASS, DEST, COPIES, AND HOLD KEYWORDS.
