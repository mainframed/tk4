*        WE THANK THE AUTHOR FOR PASSING ON THIS TSO PROMPTER
*        FOR 'SCRIPT'.
*
*        MEMBER 'SCRIPT' OF THIS FILE IS THE TSO INTERFACE
*        ROUTINE PROPER.  TO ASSEMBLE IT REQUIRES ASSEMBLER
*        (XF) WITH SYSLIB POINTING TO 'SCRIPT.TSO' AND
*        THE IBM MACROS IN 'SYS1.TSOMAC'.
*
*        THE 'SCRIPT' ROUTINE LINKS TO ROUTINE 'DEFAULTA'
*        FOR DYNAMIC FILE ALLOCATIONS.  THIS ROUTINE MUST
*        ALSO BE ASSEMBLED IN THE SAME MANNER AS 'SCRIPT'.
*
*        MEMBER NAME 'HELP' OF 'SCRIPT.TSO' IS A SUGGESTED
*        FILE FOR HELP UNDER TSO.
*
*        IT IS NO FAULT OF THE AUTHOR THAT THIS INTERFACE ROUTINE
*        HAS BECOME OUT OF DATE.  IT IS ENTIRELY DUE TO CHANGES
*        AT WATERLOO THAT THEY COULD NOT HAVE FORSEEN.  SINCE
*        THE UNIVERSITY OF WATERLOO IS NOT A TSO INSTALLATION
*        IS WAS DECIDED NOT TO ATTEMPT TO UPDATE SOMETHING WE
*        COULD NOT THEN TEST, BUT WE FELT OBLIGATED TO POINT
*        OUT AREAS OF CHANGE --
*
*        'WORKSIZE=' IS NO LONGER A RECOGNIZED PARM.
*        'SREFERENCE=' IS NO LONGER A RECOGNIZED PARM.
*
*        'MEMO' OPTION NOT SUPPORTED BY INTERFACE.
*
*        MODIFICATIONS BY JACQUES BASTIEN  --  OCTOBER 11, 1977
*        1)  MODS TO MEMBER 'SCRIPT' TO USE MORE EFFICIENTLY
*            THE ALLOCATION (DEFAULTA) PROGRAM.  ALL DATASETS
*            ARE NOW ALLOCATED THROUGH 'DEFAULTA'.  INCLUDED
*            IS ALSO A BETTER DEALLOCATION ROUTINE.
*        2)  MODIFICATIONS TO THE ALLOCATION (DEFAULTA) PROGRAM
*            SO IT CAN RUN WITHOUT ABENDING.
*        3)  MODIFICATIONS TO THE MACRO 'SAVEM' TO ZERO OUT
*            COMPLETELY A GETMAIN FIELD AND TO PUT THE GETMAIN
*            ADDRESS IN A SAFE PLACE IN THE SAVEAREA.
