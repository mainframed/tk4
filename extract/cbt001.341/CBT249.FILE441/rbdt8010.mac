  Four commands are used in conjunction with DTC Network transactions.
  are:

    %NETID(name)+
       An arbitrary name assigned to identify the network.  A NETID comm
       with the same name must be used with each transaction for a parti
       DTC Network.

    %NETREL(name...,name)+
       The NETREL command with one or more names is used with a transact
       to designate its successor job(s). This command will appear on al
       the final transaction in any DTC Network.
