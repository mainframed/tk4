%Tutorial ---------------- Find All Used Macros ------------------------
+
+    The FINDMAC program is designed to report all macros used by a
+    program and how many times they are referenced.
+
+    This report can be useful in finding any local macros used so
+    that those macros may be shipped with the source to another
+    center.
+
+    Note: Imbedded macros cannot be reported on.
