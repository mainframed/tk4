+   CNTLSCAN will allow you to browse the Control Log dataset
+   used by COPYCNTL.
+
+   The control log is used to document who is currently working on a
+   modification to a source/macro element.  It also provides an activit
+   log and history for that element.
+
+   The member name in the log corresponds to the name of the source
+   or macro that was copied.
