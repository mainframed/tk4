%Tutorial ------------------  RIBUPDTE ---------------------------------
+
+   RIBUPDTE is an IEBUPDTE simulator with several additional functions.
+
+   RIBUPDTE will accept upto two (2) 'output' files where it will searc
+   for the member to be updated.  If it does not find the member it wil
+   terminate.
+
+   If the member is found then the IEBUPDTE is simulated with a few imp
+   differences.  First, the only 2 control cards accepted are ./ CHANGE
+   and ./  ENDUP.  All others terminate processing for that member.
+
+   A check is made to determine if an update will overlay (replace) a c
+   which has a usermod id in columns 65-71, or if an insert/replace occ
+   within 4 cards prior to a usermod card.
+
+   A usermod id is determined by an @ in column 64 and column 65 having
+   first character allowed by IBM for a usermod prefix.
+
+   Parms are: ALL, NOSEP and ALNOSEP
