%TSCRAMB ---------- Tutorial Panel for Scramble ------------------------
+
+ The SCRAMBLE Program invokes a utility processor to Encipher or
+ Decipher your dataset according to the NBS standard algorithm.
+ You supply a 1 to 8 alpha-numeric keyword, from which a 48 bit
+ code key will be produced.  This code key is applied to each 8
+ bytes (64 bits) of your dataset.  Each record in the designated
+ dataset is read, en- or deciphered, and re-written in place. The
+ utility can handle records of FB or VB format with an LRECL in the
+ range of 8 to 256 bytes.  Note that the algorithm is designed to
+ work only on multiples of 8 bytes, so if the LRECL is NOT a
+ multiple of 8, then up to 7 bytes per record may be unprocessed.
+
+ WARNING: this utility operates on the actual dataset by using the
+          read-and-update-in-place technique.  If you forget the key
+          that you used to encipher the dataset, KISS THE DATA GOOD-BYE
+          because we have no way of deciphering the data again.
+
+ If you are hopelessly paranoid, you can encipher the enciphered
+ dataset with a different key to really grunge up the data.  The
+ decipherion process must be the exact inverse of the encipher process
+ in order to recover the original data again.
