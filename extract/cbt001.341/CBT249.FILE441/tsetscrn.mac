%Tutorial ---------------  SETSCRN  ------------------------------------
+
+    SETSCRN will invoke the TSO TERMINAL command to set the terminal
+    attributes to either a 3278 model 2, 4 or 5.
+
+    Optionally if no option is entered a program will be invoked to
+    display the current terminal settings.  This is also done before
+    and after a set if performed.
