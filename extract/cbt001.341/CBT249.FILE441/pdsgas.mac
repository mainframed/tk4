+   This application will process a PDS and recover all 'lost' members b
+   giving them a name of $GASnnnn.
+
+   Members may be lost by creating a new member with the same name, by
+   updating and saving an existing member, by scratching a member, by
+   linkediting a new module.
+
+   NOTE: for load libraries the module can be recovered but the linkedi
+         attributes cannot.  You must therefor relink the module before
+         using.
