+ The MVS/BDT product works only for partitioned data sets (and members)
+ for sequential datasets. A single member of a PDS may be moved to a
+ sequential dataset and vice versa. An entire PDS may be moved, or sele
+ members may be moved by indicating inclusion (selection) or exclusion
+ the operation. Replacement of like-named members may be allowed or
+ prevented.
+
+ When a sequential dsname or a partitioned dsname with member name is
+ specified, the operation will be termed a sequential transaction. When
+ partitioned dsname is specified and one or more members are selected o
+ excluded from a member selection panel, the operation is termed a PDS
+ transaction.
