+-------------------% Bulk Data Transfer IUP Tutorial +-----------------

+
+ All PDS copies are assumed to replace existing members.  If you do not
+ this to happen then you must specify REPLACE=NO on the BDT panel.
+
+ When copying a PDS with replace it is possible for the output PDS to f
+ causing an abend and an incomplete transfer.  To avoid this you can se
+ PDS to a new file or specify CLEAR=YES, which will reset the output PD
+ that it is empty prior to the reload.
+
+ This application works by converting the input file input 80 byte card
+ of 'compacted' data.  And then submitting this data as 'input' to an N
+ stream to the internal reader.  This NJE job then is routed to the out
+ center using JES3 NJE and executes there.  It rebuilds the input data
+ card images and copies the data to the specified output dataset.
+
+ If you wish to browse or modify the JCL created to perform this transf
+ may do so by specifying YES to the option on the BDT panel and you wil
+ allowed to BROWSE, EDIT, SUBMIT or CANCEL the JCL.  Note that in this
+ you MUST explicitly to the SUBMIT after doing your thing to the JCL.
