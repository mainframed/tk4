+
+ To build a GMJD library member, specify option%B+on the GMJD panel.  Y
  GMJDLIB dataset must exist. If it does not, you will be prompted with
+ information to create that dataset. A default name of userid.MVSBDT.GM
+ will be suggested, but you may name the dataset as you wish. Your GMJD
+ name will be stored in your ISPF Profile, so that it will appear for f
+ GMJD requests.
+
+ To build a member, you will be asked for much the same dataset informa
+ as for building a transaction:
+
+     - information about the FROM dataset
+     - information about the TO dataset
+     - a name for the GMJD member (required)
