%Tutorial ---------------  COPYCNTL ------------------------------------
+
+   The COPYCNTL program will copy a source/macro element from the
+   specified library to your library.  In doing the copy a control log
+   updated with the programmer name, date, time, status, and modificati
+   id for which the copy is being performed.  If during the copy it is
+   determined that more copies have been done than have completion flag
+   then you will be notified and prompted for permission to continue or
+   cancel the copy.
+
+   If after having copied an element and you determine that you no long
+   have any use for it you may run COPYCNTL with the CANCEL option whic
+   will update the control log with the new status of cancel.
+
+   When you have completed using the element and have successfully
+   implemented your modification to that element then you should run
+   COPYCNTL with the option of FINished to close out the activity for
+   that element.
+
+   Option New may be used to log an entry for a new element.
