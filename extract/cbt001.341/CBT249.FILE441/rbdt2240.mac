  The first time you attempt to build a GMJD Library member, you will be
  shown a screen to assist with the allocation of that library. The name
  'userid.mvsbdt.gmjdlib' will be suggested as the dataset name, but you
  alter that to any dataset name you wish. The name will be stored in yo
  ISPF profile and will reappear on panels when required.

+ You will also be provided with suggested values for for the type of
  allocation units, either TRKS or CYLS, the number of units for the pri
  allocation, secondary allocation, the number of blocks to be used for
  directory and, finally, a blocksize. The record length will be
  automatically set at 80.  You may alter the suggested values as you wi
  Remember, however, that the BLKSIZE must be a multiple of 80, or the
  allocation will fail.
