//***FILE 282 is from Amdahl and contains a simplified interface    *
//*           between PL/1 programs and the installed operating     *
//*           system's SORT program.                                *
//*                                                                 *
//*           This file comes from File 23 of the SHARE PL/1 Tape.  *
//*                                                                 *
//*      Summary:  A simplified interface for SORTing, allowing     *
//*       the use of any PL/I structure for sorting rather than     *
//*       limiting sorting to just character strings.  The          *
//*       members of the PDS are:  SORTASM, the sort interface      *
//*       module written in assembler; SORTPLI, the declaration     *
//*       of SORTASM used in an invoking PL/I module; and           *
//*       SORTDOC, a printable file of documentation for the        *
//*       interface.                                                *
//*                                                                 *
