This modification places control of IBM's Network Communications Control
Facility (NCCF) logon security under ACF2 and provides a base on which
further ACF2 control of NCCF functions may be implemented.  It was
developed using NCCF release 2 and is now running with NCCF version 2,
release 1 and ACF2 3.1.4.

The following members of this library are parts of the NCCF logon
security modification:

    DSIEX14     the NCCF normal logoff exit
    LIDREC      SMP format changes to USERLID and USERCFDE members of
                ACFMAC
    M99A0N      the NCCF logon security frontend module
    RH00027     SMP format addition of M99A0N and JCLIN for DSILAN

All other members are macros required to assemble DSIEX14 and/or M99A0N.
Assembly of M99A0N and DSIEX14 requires ACFMAC and this library in the
assembler SYSLIB concatenation.

LIDREC

The LIDREC SMP changes add three fields to the USERLID portion of the
LIDREC and definitions of these fields to the ACF2 Field Definition
Record (FDR).  These fields are used to control who may logon to NCCF
and what logon options are available.  You should check the sequence
numbers of these statements for possible collision with existing user
modifications.

M99A0N

M99A0N is the frontend code for the NCCF normal logon validation module,
DSILAN.  When it receives control, it allocates a private data area
which is chained from the NCCF Task Vector Block (TVB) user field,
TVBUFLD, and contains the ACF2 request parameter list, message buffer,
and pointers to the ACMCB and LIDREC for the logged on user.  M99A0N
then proceeds to pre-validate the logonid and password entered on the
NCCF logon screen and calls ACF2 to validate the logonid/password
combination and return the appropriate LIDREC.  If the combination is
valid, the password entered by the user is changed to a constant 'A' so
that the NCCF DSIOPF member need not be maintained for password changes
and the NCCF logon control bit in the LIDREC is checked to assure that
the logonid is approved to use NCCF.

With the LIDREC available, M99A0N checks for entry of an NCCF profile
name on the logon screen.  If one is entered, a bit in the LIDREC is
tested for authority to enter a profile name.  If no profile name is
entered, the Parse Descriptor Block (PDB) for the logon command and the
logon command buffer are altered to contain the default profile name
from the LIDREC.

M99A0N also validates the hardcopy device name from the logon command.
If the device name is 'NO', it is eliminated from the PDB.  If the
device name is 'YES', the LIDREC hardcopy device field is tested for an
entry; if the LIDREC hardcopy device field contains a device name, it is
substituted in the PDB and command buffer for the word 'YES'; if the
LIDREC hardcopy device field contains no entry, the request for hardcopy
logging is rejected.  If the device name entered in the logon command is
neither 'YES' nor 'NO', it is assumed to be a device name and a bit in
the LIDREC is tested for authority to enter a hardcopy device name.

If all logon validation checks are passed successfully, control is
passed to DSILAN with no evidence of M99A0N's existence except the
private data area chained from TVBUFLD.  This data area is available to
all other NCCF functions for the user and its pointers to ACF2 data
areas may therefore be used to implement additional ACF2 control of NCCF
functions.  If the logon attempt fails validation, control is returned
to M99A0N's caller after releasing all resources acquired.

A consequence of this approach is that all possible valid combinations
of logon parameters must be defined in NCCF's parameter members so that
a logon attempt which passes M99A0N validation is guaranteed to pass
DSILAN's validation.  The easiest way to provide this guarantee is to
define all operators with all possible profile names and let M99A0N
control the situation.  The same is true for hardcopy devices; NCCF
should know all possible hardcopy device names.

NOTE that the LOGONID used by the NCCF started task must have the MUSASS
and NO-SMC attributes.

DSIEX14

DSIEX14 is the NCCF normal logoff exit.  Its function in the
modification is to release the private data area and ACF2 resources
acquired by M99A0N when the user logged on.  It should be placed in a
linklist library for loading by NCCF.

RH00027

RH00027 is the SMP installation of module M99A0N as a frontend to
DSILAN.  It contains JCLIN to inform SMP of the new linkage edit
requirements for DSILAN.
