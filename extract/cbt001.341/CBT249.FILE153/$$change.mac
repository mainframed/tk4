//*
//*     I HAVE MODIFIED SEVERAL MODULES.  ALL MODULES THAT HAVE
//*     BEEN MODIFIED HAVE THE ORIGINAL SOURE WITH THE SAME NAME
//*     ENDING IN A "O".  THIS WAS TO FIX EXISTING PROBLEMS IN
//*     SOME OF THE LOGIC.  THREE MODULES HAVE THE SAME NAME ENDING
//*     IN A "T".  THESE MODULES ARE USED TO SUPPORT TTY TERMINALS.
//*     CHANGES HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED FROM SEVERAL VERSIONS.  I
//*     HAVE ADDED A MODULE "Q91" SO THE SCREEN SIZE (# OF LINES AND
//*     LINE LENGTH) MAY BE CHANGED (SCR # #).  THE ONLY OTHER CHANGE
//*     I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS THE REQUE,CANCEL AND PURGE COMMANDS
//*     NOT USE THE SUBSYSTEM INTERFACE.  THIS FUNCTIONS WILL NOT WORK
//*     ON ALTERNATE CHECKPOINT DATASETS.
//*     IT SEEMS EVERYONE WANTS TO MODIFY THIS COMMAND.  MY GOAL IS
//*     TO TAKE CHANGES I HAVE MADE, FIX SOME BUGS, AND ADD CHANGES
//*     FROM OTHER VERSIONS BEFORE WE GET OVERUN WITH DIFFERENT
//*     VERSIONS OF THE "Q" COMMAND.
