                  HOW TO USE THE PROBPDS SYSTEM

     USING EDIT, UPDATE THE $MODEL ENTRY TO PUT YOUR SUPPORT CENTER
PHONE NUMBER ON THE FIRST LINE, YOUR ACCESS CODE ON THE SECOND LINE,
YOUR CPU SERIAL NUMBER ON THE THIRD LINE, AND IT'S MODEL ON THE THIRD
LINE.  THE SUPPORT CENTER KEEPS ASKING THESE QUESTIONS AND THIS IS A
GOOD PLACE TO KEEP THIS INFORMATION.

     YOU WILL HAVE TO ASSEMBLE AND LINK THE PROGRAM FROM $PROBLST INTO A
STEPLIB CALLING IT PROBLIST.  THIS PROGRAM READS ALL MEMBERS THAT DON'T
START WITH A $ AND PARSES OUT THE DATA TO BUILD $INDEX AND $CLOSED
MEMBERS.

     WHEN A PROBLEM OCCURS, SPF EDIT THE PROBPDS DATASET TO GET A MEMBER
SELECTION LIST.  SCROLL TO THE END OF THE LIST AND SELECT PRBXXXXX,
WHERE XXXXX IS THE NUMBER OF THE LAST PROBLEM + 1.

     COPY IN $MODEL.  FILL IN THE __'S OR .'S AS YOU CAN.  ENTER A ONE
LINE ABSTRACT.  USE AS MANY 'DESC' LINES AS NECESSARY FOR THE
DESCRIPTION.  WE NORMALLY THEN USE THE 'UPDATE/ACTION' ENTRY FROM $MODEL
TO DESCRIBE WHAT WE DID FIRST, I.E. SEARCHED INFO, CALLED THE SUPPORT
CENTER, ETC.  DELETE ANY UNUSED 'ACTION' LINES.  MAKE SURE THE STATUS IS
'OPEN' OR THE PROBLEM WON'T SHOW UP IN $INDEX.

     WHEN YOU WANT TO UPDATE A PROBLEM, EDIT IT, SCROLL TO THE BOTTOM,
AND COPY IN $ACTION.  FILL IT IN AND DELETE ANY UNUSED 'ACTION' LINES.

     WHEN YOU WANT TO CLOSE A PROBLEM, EDIT THE MEMBER AND CHANGE THE
STATUS TO 'CLOSED'.  WE ALWAYS ADD THE DATE IN THE FORM OF MM/DD/YY.DDD
BUT THIS ISN'T NECESSARY.

     WHEN IT COMES TO PROBLEM MEETING TIME, EXECUTE THE JCL FROM MEMBER
$JCL.  THE REPORT WILL HAVE TWO PARTS; THE INDEX OF ALL OPEN PROBLEMS
(THIS LOOKS A LOT LIKE $INDEX MEMBER) AND THEN THE DETAILED ENTRIES FOR
ALL OPEN PROBLEMS BY SEVERITY (I.E.  SEVERITY 1, SEVERITY 2, ...).

     THIS JOB MUST HAVE DISP=OLD ON THE PROBPDS DATASET SINCE IT USES
QSAM TO UPDATE THE $INDEX AND $CLOSED MEMBERS.

     A LOT OF FANCY THINGS COULD BE DONE WITH THE PROBLIST PROGRAM SUCH
AS USING IT TO TRACK 'LATE' PROBLEMS BASED ON REPORTED DATE AND SEVERITY
OR ALLOWING A USER TO INQUIRE INTO WHICH PROBLEMS WERE HIS.  THE PROGRAM
IS FAIRLY MODULAR AND SHOULD BE EASY TO MODIFY.  FOR US, WE GOT THE RICH
MAN'S PROBLEM MANAGEMENT TOOL, INFO/MGMT!
