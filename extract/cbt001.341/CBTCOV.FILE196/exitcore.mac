***********************************************************************
*
*        MAP OF THE GETMAINED AREA USED BY ALL SMF EXITS.
*        THE AREA IS GETMAINED ONCE IN IEFUJI & IS NOT FREEMAINED -DGH-
*        UNTIL THE LAST CALL TO IEFACTRT (JOBEND) FOR A JOB.
*        THE SIZE OF THE GETMAINED AREA IS DETERMINED IN IEFUJI-
*        CHECK IT FOR THE NOW-CURRENT SIZE @ TAB ECSIZE OR ECTSOSIZ
*        USER-DEFINED VARIABLES SHOULD BE PLACED DIRECTLY BEHIND

*        NAMES FOR USE BY A SPECIFIC EXIT, THE 'ECFOLLOW'
*        MACRO MUST BE ISSUED.
