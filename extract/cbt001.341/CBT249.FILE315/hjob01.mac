   MENU IS DISPLAYED.  TO SELECT A PROCESSING PROGRAM FROM THIS MENU
   ENTER A NUMBER FROM&"1"$TO&"12"$IN THE "SELECT OPTION" FIELD.

   JOB STATEMENT INFORMATION IS ALSO ENTERED ON THIS MENU.  FOUR LINES
   ARE PROVIDED FOR JCL CARD IMAGES.  THESE LINES ARE SUBMITTED AS PART
   OF THE BACKGROUND JOB EXACTLY AS THEY ARE ENTERED (EXCEPT FOR ENTIREL
   BLANK LINES WHICH ARE IGNORED).  ALL OF THE RULES OF JCL MUST BE
   FOLLOWED.  SPF DOES NOT PERFORM ANY VALIDITY CHECKING OF THE JOB STAT

   IF THE JOBNAME CONSISTS OF YOUR USER ID FOLLOWED BY A LETTER (A TO Z)
   A NUMBER (0 TO 9), SPF WILL INCREMENT IT AUTOMATICALLY TO PREVENT
   DUPLICATE JOBNAMES. SPF ASSUMES THAT THE FIRST&"//"$CARD CONTAINS THE
   JOBNAME.  JOB STATEMENTS ARE REMEMBERED FROM SESSION TO SESSION.

   ENTER&"CANCEL"$IN THE&"SELECT OPTION"$FIELD.
