)F CBT  TIMESHARING SERVICE NEWS FACILITY:

   The "NEWS" Command is used to display informational news items which
   are in the System News Dataset.  Optionally, other news datasets may
   be displayed if they exist.

   Each News-Item consists of a summary line containing a unique Item
   Number, the Date and Time when that item was added, and a retirement
   date after which the item has expired.  Each News Item also has a
   detailed entry associated with it which can be displayed.

   The NEWS Command operates in fullscreen mode for 3270 terminals
   unless a specific item is requested on the initial command line,
   and in line-oriented mode for ASCII terminals.  In 3270 fullscreen
   mode, additional help is available by issuing "H" or PFK 1/13 once
   the summary listing has been displayed, or initially specifying
   "NEWS HELP".
