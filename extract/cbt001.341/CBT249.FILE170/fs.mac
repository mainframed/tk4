       Full Screen Subcommand of EDIT



   The College of William and Mary is offering a full screen edit
   subcommand of the TSO EDIT command to any SHARE/GUIDE member
   who requests it. The subcommand of EDIT is called FS. Installations
   who would like to obtain a copy (object code only) may send a
   300 foot tape (SL prefered) to the address below. Please include
   an envelope with return address and postage attached. This envelope
   will be attached to the package to be returned. The package
   will include your tape and one printed copy of the user manual
   and installation instructions. The tape will also contain the
   user manual.

   Tapes may be written at either 1600 or 6250 bpi. We can not
   provide 800 bpi tapes. If the density is not specified in
   the request, 6250 will be used.

    Mail requests, tape and envelope with return address and postage
    to:

      ATTN: FS SUPPORT


    FS is a copyrighted program which may be used on any CPU
    at the requesting installation. It should not be redistributed.
    The user manual may be copied/printed without modification for
    use by members of the requesting installation.


   ADVANTAGES OF FS

       FS uses the IBM EDIT command workfile and its access
       method. This provides a full screen edit function for
       large files without the large region requirements of
       incore full screen editors.

       FS is a very inexpensive way to provide limited full
       screen editing to 3270 users. It supports 3277, and 3278
       terminals which have at least 24 lines. FS operates as
       a TSO EDIT subcommand on a TSO using either TCAM or VTAM.
       It has been used under MVS/3.8, MVSE, and SP. It does
       require the TCAM MCP  support for SPF fullscreen
       protocol (described in the installation guide).

       Most normal EDIT subcommands are supported from within
       the FS subcommand (as well as on-the-screen data
       modifications). Upper/lower case data is supported or
       converted to caps by the EDIT access method depending
       on the EDIT command used. Files may be numbered or NONUM.
       FS supports PFKs for certain functions. Line numbered
       files have the numbers displayed in their true position.
       Lines may easily be reordered by changing the line numbers
       on the screen.

       FS provides most of the system performance gains from
       full screen editing over line editing (fewer interupts).
       See the region and I/O points below.



   DISADVANTAGES OF FS

       FS is a limited function full screen editor. It is not
       a replacement for a high function full screen editor like
       SPF. It does not provide any menu driving facilities.

       FS only supports files of FIXED LENGTH RECORDS of 80 bytes.
       Any BLKSIZE allowed under the TSO EDIT command is supported.
       Currently, FS only uses 24 lines of a screen; it works
       on larger screens, but only using 24 lines by 80 characters.

       PFKs are not user definable. No split screen support is
       provided.

       Extra disk I/O is used to support this form of full
       screen editing in place of the large TSO region. That
       is, the EDIT workfile access method will require some
       DASD I/O not performed by user tasks under an incore
       full screen editor, however, the SWAP/PAGING load should
       be lower using FS.



  DESIGN

       There are three screen formats displayed below. The first
       is used for editing existing data lines. The second is
       used when entering the fullscreen input mode of FS. The
       third is the FS input mode screen. The FS input mode allows
       faster program/data input than normal EDIT INPUT. It may
       be used to insert a group of lines between other lines or
       to add lines at the end of the file. The second screen is
       only used to select an input increment for the FS input mode.

   Input lines are framed by existing lines for input within context.
   In both the EDIT mode and INPUT mode of FS, the twenty line area
   is all one 3270 field.

   Three subcommands of EDIT are also distributed with FS.
   Briefly, these include an INFO subcommand to display the
   name of the EDIT file and record count and status; a command
   invoking subcommand (like X of PCF but supported under FS);
   and a submit-like function to submit the EDIT work file as
   a job to JES2.


   Although FS is in use at the College of William and Mary, no
   warranty, expressed or implied, is made by the author, the
   College of William and Mary, or the Commonwealth of Virginia
   as to the accuracy and function of the package or any part or
   related material, nor shall the fact of distribution constitute
   any such warranty, and no responsibility is assumed by the
   above mentioned parties.
