°  AMDPSCAN is a  user exit for AMDPRDMP for  VS2 rel3.8 with se2.  It i
°  invoked by using an AMDPRDMP control card with the verb 'SCAN' on it.
°      The objectives of this exit:-

°       1/  To check  various  flags  bits in  the  dump  which may  hav
°       contributed to  the failure, but would  not have been  noticed b
°       the PSCE unless he was specifically  looking for them. An exampl
°       of this would be the 'SQA' critical bit in the GDA.

°       2/ Control  block verification.  VS2 has  many queues  of contro
°       blocks and a symptom or cause  of system failure is frequently a
°       invalid  control block  or  a  corrupted queue.   Scanning  thes
°       control  blocks 'manually'  would  be too  time  consuming to  b
°       practical.  AMDPSCAN  scans  many   control  blocks  and  queues
°       printing error messages and leading the  PSCE to the cause of th
°       problem.

°  INSTALLATION
¸
°      Before AMDPSCAN can be used, the verb SCAN must be
°  added to AMDPRDMP's control table, AMDPRECT.
°  This is done as follows:-

°  1) Obtain a superzap dump of AMDPRECT (normally in LINKLIB)
°  2) Locate the next available unused entry.
°     An empty entry looks like this.....

°     40404040 40404040 00000000 40404040 40404040

°  3) Apply the following superzap.
°
°     name amdprect
°     VER  XXXX  40404040 40404040 00000000 40404040 40404040
°     REP  XXXX  C1D4C4D7 E2C3C1D5 00000000 E2C3C1D5 40404040
°
°     This makes the verb SCAN known to amdprdmp.

°  USE.

°
°     To use the dump scan feature simply code the verb SCAN
°  in your AMDPRDMP control cards.
°
°     To use the feature in csect 'AMDPSLOP' to force the printing of
°  the 'next' 5000 instructions to be executed in a 'STANDALONE'
°  dump, simply locate the 'NO-OP' at offset X'8AE' in 'AMDPSLOP'
°  and change it to an 'UNCONDITIONAL BRANCH'.
°     Should the location of this 'NO-OP' change due to maintenance
°  to 'AMDPSLOP', the 'NO-OP' can be easily located in a 'DUMPT'
°  by 'eyeballing' for a constant - 'TRACE SWITCH'.

  ________ ________
°  VALIDITY CHECKING

°      Validity  checking  is  performed  by   a  common  sub-routine  i
°  AMDPSCAN.   Addresses are  checked for  correct  boundary alignment
°  word, double-word, 4K or 64K.
°      Addresses are also checked to see if they are in the right area o
°  virtual storage.  Storage is split up into 6 areas - PSA, NUCLEUS, th
°  Private  Area, CSA,  LPA  and SQA.   In  addition,  for some  validit
°  checking, the Private Area is further divided into LSQA and PVTUSER.
°      Addresses are  checked using 'negative  logic'. If an  address of
°  for example, a UCB should be in the NUCLEUS, a check is made to see i
°  the address is in  the PSA, the Private Area, CSA, LPA  or SQA.  If i
°  is, then an error is recognised. In  this way if the boundaries of fo
°  example, the  NUCLEUS, can not  be determined at  initialisation time
°  address validation can still be performed although restricted.
°      Note:- The PSA is not considered to be part of the NUCLEUS.

°      The boundaries of 8 areas are determined as follows:-

°  PSA
°       PSA is from location 0 to location X'FFF'
°  NUCLEUS
°       The NUCLEUS  starts at  location X'1000'. Top  of the  NUCLEUS i
°       determined from  the CVT  field CVTNUCB.  If this  is invalid  o
°       inaccessable, the start of the Private  Area is used as the end
°       of the NUCLEUS.
°  Private Area
°           Start of  the Private Area is  determined from the  GDA fiel
°       PASTRT. If  this is invalid or  inaccessable then the  address o
°       the top of the NUCLEUS is used instead.
°           The  top of  the Private  Area  is calculated  by adding  th
°       address  of the  start  of  the Private  Area  to  the GDA  fiel
°       PASIZE.
°  CSA
°           GDA field  CSAPQEP points to the  PQE for CSA. The  PQERGN i
°       the PQE is  used for the start  of CSA, and this  plus PQESIZE i
°       the top of CSA.
°  LPA
°           LPA in this  context is the area  between the top of  CSA an
°       the bottom of SQA.
°  SQA
°           The address  of the start of  SQA is taken from  the DQEBLKA
°       field in the  last DQE chained to  the SPQE for SQA.  The SPQE i
°       found from the GDA field SQAPQEP.

°  LSQA
°          LSQA is  mapped from DQEs  for LSQA  chained from the  LDA fo
°       each address space.

°  PVTUSER
°          PVTUSER is that part of the Private Area that is not LSQA.

°  CONTROL BLOCK TRACING

°      Most control blocks  referenced are traced by a  common routine i
°  AMDPSCAN.   This routine  uses a  525  entry trace  table, each  entr
°  containing the control block address and name.
°      The control block trace is printed after most errors, oldest entr
°  first.
°      Loop checking is also performed by the trace routine, checks bein
°  made to see if  the address being traced already appears  in the trac
°  table.

°  SYSTEM RESOURCE ANALYSIS

°  This  function  is   performed  by  CSECT  AMDPSALZ,   which  analyse
°  information traced by CSECTS : AMDPSLOK, AMDPSPAG, AMDPSQCB, AMDPSCAN
°  AMDPSUCB.
°      These CSECT's trace information about the following 'resources' :
°            Page Supervisor
°            I/O Devices
°            Locks
°            QCB's
°            Real Storage Frames
°            WQE's
°            ORE's

°      Details are printed of the holder of each resource and any waitor
°  for these resources. The resources are  printed in order of importanc
°  to the system at the time of the  dump. If a waitor also holds anothe
°  resource details of that resource are printed.  From this relationshi
°  of  resource holders/waitors  it should  be possible  to identify  th
°  'critical' system resource at the time of the dump.

°   Example 1
°            a) I/O outstanding on a device for which the
°               communications task is waiting.
°            b) Most jobs in the system waiting for WQE buffer
°               resource which is held by communications task.

°      It can  be seen  that this is  probably an I/O  problem and  not
°  comm's task error.

°   Example 2
°            a) Most TCB/SSRB's dispatched in ASID 1 are
°               waiting for the local lock.
°            b) LOCAL lock holder is in a 'page-wait', and
°               also holds the CMS lock.
°            c) Page supervisor is waiting for I/O to
°               complete on a paging device.
°            d) Other address spaces are waiting for
°               the CMS lock.

°      It can  be seen  that this is  probably an I/O  problem and  not
°  locking problem as it might first appear from the dump.

°      A check is made for an interlock condition between holders/waitor
°  of resources. Details are printed if an interlock is detected.

°   Example:
°            holder of resource 'A' is waiting for resource 'B'
°            holder of resource 'B' is waiting for resource 'A'

°  CPU STATUS ANALYSIS

°  This  function  is  performed  by CSECT  AMDPSLOP.  Unlike  all  othe
°  AMDPSCAN  CSECTs, AMDPSLOP  reads the  dump  dataset directly  withou
°  using AMDPRDMP.
°   The CPU status records are read from  the dump dataset. If the PSW i
°  the store status  has the wait bit  off, and the status  is valid, th
°  instruction stream pointed  to by the psw  is simulated. If a  loop i
°  detected an instruction trace is printed.
°   A message is  printed indicating whether the  CPU is enabled/disable
°  waiting/ executing or looping.
°   The  dataset described  by  the SYSUT3  DD  card is  used  as a  BDA
°  'paging' dataset during instruction simulation.

°      If AMDPSCAN produces  many messages indicating that  addresses ar
°  invalid, when they appear to be correct, check that the fields used t
°  establish the boundaries  of the storage areas are  valid. See sectio
°  on 'Validity Checking' for definition of these fields.

°      While  AMDPSCAN   does  function  with   SYS1.DUMPs  as   well  a
°  stand-alone dumps, the output may be misleading in some cases. This i
°  because control block chains may have been modified while the dump wa
°  being taken. This is particularly so for I/O control blocks.

°  INSTRUCTION TRACE FORMAT

°  The next  5 pages show the  format of the simulated  instruction trac
°  produced by AMDPSLOP when a loop is recognised.

°      The  PSW and  instruction  are  printed  before execution  of  th
°  instruction.

°     The registers 0-7  and 8-15 are printed after the  execution of th
°  previously printed instruction.  The registers are not  printed unles
°  at least  one register  is changed.  by  the instruction.  Observe th
°  1807 instruction on  the eighth line of  the sample trace.  This  is
°  load register  0 from  7. Note  that the  contents of  register 0  ha
°  changed  and is  the same  as the  contents  of register  7.  The  tw
°  previous  instructions, 40803024  and  50803004,  did not  change  an
°  register contents, and hence the registers were not printed.

°     AMDPSLOP  is not  capable of simulating  all instructions.  When a
°  unsimulatable   instruction  is   found,   the  message   'UNSUPPORTE
°  INSTRUCTION. TREATED AS  NOP.' will be printed in the  trace. The use
°  must then decide whether this instruction has any effect on the loop.
