   You reached this panel by entering O to the right of%COMMAND ===>+
   on a panel which accepts PDS subcommands.  This command option panel
   directs you as to which PDS subcommands are available.

   Shorthand notes:
    1.  You can bypass the O command option panel.  For example, enter
        O.VE as a command to enter the VERIFY assistance panel.  Note:
        the following example would skip both panels:  O.VE.memname stat
    2.  From the O command option panel, you can bypass the
        assistance panel.  For example, enter: ve.memname stats
        to format the subcommand:  Verify memname stats

   To get explanations of PDS subcommands, you need to reference the PDS
   HELP data set.  Enter HE from the%OPTION ===>+line on the O command
   option panel to use the HELP subcommand assistance panel.
