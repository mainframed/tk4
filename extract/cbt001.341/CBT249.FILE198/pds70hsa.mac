%OPTION  ===>_ZCMD
+
   The program mode chosen affects only the initial mode on entry to the
   PDS command; you can switch to any of the other following program
   modes at a later time:
     ISPMODE   - A scrollable log of the PDS session is maintained
                 in an ISPF dialog table.  This table is managed by
                 special control codes from various panels.
     MEMLIST   - A scrollable member list is maintained in an ISPF
                 dialog table.  Individual PDS subcommands can be
                 entered as line commands to process specific members.
     Line mode - PDS communicates using PUTLINE and PUTGET MACROS;
                 ISPMODE logs and member lists are not maintained.
