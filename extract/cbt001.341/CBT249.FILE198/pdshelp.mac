)F FUNCTION -
 The PDS45678 command allows a TSO user to access and manipulate the
 directory and selected members of a PDS or partitioned data set.

 PDS45678 subcommands are available to display statistics on the data
 set directory and data set usage, modify the data set directory,
 modify the DCB attributes of the data set, compress the data set and
 validity check the data set.

 Additional subcommands can display portions of the member name
 directory, list occurances of a search string in a member, restore
 a previously deleted member, create an alias for a member, display
 all aliases for a member, locate a member with desired attributes,
 and browse, list, delete or rename a member.

 For load data sets, subcommands are available to display and modify
 the linkage attributes of a module, list the history data for a
 module and map the CSECT structure of a module.

 For other partitioned data sets, subcommands are available to submit
 a JCL member, edit a member, print a member, compare two members in
 a data set and display SPF statistics for a member.


 PDS45678 command features:
    Hexadecimal member names -- member names may be entered in hex for
    any of the subcommands which accept member names (or partial member
    names) as input.  Thus, for these subcommands, x'd7c4e2f9' and PDS9
    are equivalent.  Also, note that x'333' and x'0333' are equivalent.

    Default member names -- if no member name is entered for an ATTRIB,
    BROWSE, DELETE, DIRENTRY, DSPRINT, EDIT, FIND, FSE, HISTORY, IF,
    LIST, MAP, MEMBERS, MEMLIST, OUTCOPY, PRINTOFF, REVIEW, SUBMIT,
    TSOEDIT, TSOLIST or VERIFY subcommand, the PDS45678 command will
    use the last member name or member group entered for any of these
    subcommands.  In addition, note that the ALIAS, RENAME and RESTORE
    subcommands also modify the default member name.

    Member groups -- the above subcommands which allow default member
    names also accept ranges and patterns of member names.  A member
    name range is of the form name1:name2, which selects the same
    members as  DISPLAY name1 name2.  A pattern member name is
    of the form name1/name2, which selects the same members as
    PATTERN name1 name2.

    Member lists -- the above subcommands which allow default member
    names also allow lists of member names which can be composed of
    normal member names and member group names.  When a member list is
    used, the subcommand receives control separately for each member
    specification in the list.

    Extended HELP -- additional help for numbered PDS45678 messages
    is available in the HELP data set; also, for warning and error
    messages, a .? subcommand may be entered to request explanations
    of the last few messages received.

    Sequential data sets -- the BROWSE, DSPRINT, EDIT, FIND, FIXPDS,
    FSE, LIST, PRINTOFF, REVIEW, SUBMIT, TSOEDIT, TSOLIST and VERIFY
    subcommands are also defined for sequential data sets.  The
    documented syntax is unchanged except that no data is entered
    corresponding to any member name position.

    Subcommand name abbreviations -- subcommand names can be
    abbreviated to the first few characters of the subcommand name.
    Subcommand names are scanned in the order of output from the
    OPTIONS subcommand; the first match between the entered name
    and the subcommand name table is used.

=ATTRIB=A=AT=ATT=ATTR=ATTRI
)F  Example -     ATTRIB mema:memb rent reus refr

 The ATTRIB subcommand lists the attributes of a member.

 If the data set is a load library --
 The following linkage editor attributes are identified:
   AMODE     - addressing mode (if AMODE is not 24 or RMODE is not 24)
   AUTH      - APF authorized
   DC        - downward compatible (the module can be reprocessed by
               a level E linkage editor).
   LOAD ONLY - only loadable (OL -- the module can be brought into main
               storage only with a LOAD MACRO)
   NOT EDIT  - not editable (the module cannot be linkage edited)
   NOT EXEC  - not executable (the linkage editor noted an error and
               LET processing was not requested)
   OVERLAY   - overlay load module structure
   PAGE      - page alignment required
   REFR      - refreshable (replaceable by a new copy during execution)
   RENT      - reentrant (executable by several tasks simultaneously)
   REUS      - reusable (executable by several tasks in serial order)
   RLD error - if there is a mismatch between the directory RLD/CONTROL
               field and the first RLD entry of OS/VS linked modules
   RMODE     - residence mode (if RMODE is not 24 or AMODE is not 24)
   SCTR      - scatter load module structure
   SSI       - SSI information in hexadecimal
   TEST      - linked with the TEST option

 In addition, the ATTRIB subcommand can add or delete several linkage
 attributes for a load module.  When the ATTRIB subcommand is changing
 a module's attributes and the module is reentrant, the reusable
 attribute is also added as is done by the linkage editor.

 If a non-alias module is assigned a RMODE or AMODE value, any
 associated alias directory entries are updated to reflect the same
 RMODE value and the main module's AMODE value.

 If the module is an alias and unless NOALIASINFO is specified or
 CONTROL NOALIASINFO is in effect, the name of any corresponding
 main member will be displayed if it exists; otherwise, the module
 name from the alias directory entry (the main module name at the
 time the alias was created) will be displayed.

 If the module is not an alias and unless NOALIASINFO is specified or
 CONTROL NOALIASINFO is in effect, the name of any corresponding alias
 members and any apparent aliases will be displayed.

 Caution: this subcommand modifies the data set if linkage edit
 attributes are specified.  To ensure data set integrity, you should
 allocate the data set as OLD or be aware of the data set update
 protection provided by the PDS45678 command for SHR allocations
 (for details, enter HELP UPDATE).

 If the data set is not a load library --
 SPF statistics are displayed for members last saved by SPF edit,
 SSI information can be added or changed before being displayed and
 alias information is displayed as follows:
   A.  If the member is an alias, an -A is displayed after the member
       name; unless NOALIASINFO is specified or CONTROL NOALIASINFO
       is in effect, the name of any corresponding main member will
       also be displayed.
   B.  If the member is not an alias and if ALIASINFO is specified,
       the name of any corresponding alias members and any apparent
       aliases will be displayed.

  If the data set is not a load library, the alias name may be used
  as an alternate name for the identified member.

  If the data set is a load library, then if the alias name is an
  imbedded external name within the load module, that external name
  will be used as the alias entry point; otherwise, the entry point
  of the named member will be used as the alias entry point.

  Caution: this subcommand modifies the data set. To ensure data set
  integrity, you should allocate the data set as OLD or be aware of
  the data set update protection provided by the PDS45678 command for
  SHR allocations (for details, enter HELP UPDATE).

            if no operands are entered.
 REQUIRED - none.
)O OPERANDS -
  dsname       - specifies the data set name.  If a data set name of
                 * is entered, the current data set name is assumed.

))FILE(ddname) - specifies the data set is already allocated with the
                 provided ddname.  Note that only disk data sets are
                 supported and concatenated files are not allowed.
                 If the FILE keyword is used, dsname, SHR/OLD and
                 VOLUME(name) should not also be used.

))VOLUME(name) - specifies the volume name on which the data set
                 resides.  If a volume name is entered, SYSALLDA is
                 assumed as the unit name; otherwise, the unit name
                 from the catalog is used.

                 Note:  this parameter should be used if the data
                 set is not cataloged.
))SHR          - specifies that the data set is to be allocated with

))NOLIST   - specifies that no compress messages are to be displayed.
=CONTROL=CON=CONT=CONTR=CONTRO
)F  Example -     CONTROL dsname(lib.cntl(pdsdata)) old

 The CONTROL subcommand specifies global and immediate processing
 options.

 Most CONTROL subcommand operands (such as ALIASINFO and SINGLE) are
 global in that they remain in effect until reset by another CONTROL
 subcommand.

 The other operands (such as TESTABEND and IOSTATS) are immediate and
 take effect for only a single CONTROL subcommand.

 CONTROL does not utilize SPF services; however, when it is first
 invoked with either the SYSOUT or DSNAME operands, it attempts to
 establish an SPF environment so that subsequent subcommands can
 utilize SPF services.

 Note that the input buffering type (SINGLE, DOUBLE or MULTIPLE) is
 reset for each data set allocated according to the device type on
 which the data set resides.  In general, MULTIPLE buffering is used
 for device types which support the READ MULTIPLE CCW and DOUBLE is
 used otherwise.

                  from a storage stack.

                  YES/NO prompting is normally performed at the
                  following decision points:
                     1.  before renaming a group of members
                     2.  before deleting a default member
                     3.  before deleting a group of members
                     4.  before restoring a member found in scan mode

=DISPLAY=D=DI=DIS=DISP=DISPL=DISPLA
)F  Example -     DISPLAY aa b4

   The DISPLAY subcommand lists member names from the data set
   directory.  Note the default member group is not affected by
   either the DISPLAY or PATTERN subcommands.

   Note that -A is added following a displayed member name if the
   member name is an alias.  The member name is listed in a combined
   hexadecimal/character format if it does not contain upper case
   alphanumeric characters (including @, $ and #) or if the first
   character is numeric.  Unprintable characters (for 3270-type

=FIND=F=FI=FIN
)F  Example -     FIND mema:memb /this data/

  The FIND subcommand displays portions of a member which contain a
  search string.  Optionally, the THEN or ELSE keywords may be entered
  to allow conditional execution of other subcommands.

 Unprintable characters for 3270-type devices are translated to periods
 before they are displayed.

 The FIND formats are NUM, SNUM, NONUM, LBLOCK, LDUMP, BLOCK and DUMP;
 for load modules, the NUM, SNUM and NONUM formats are equivalent
 to the LDUMP format.

 The default format is initially NUM; however, each time a format
 operand is entered on a LIST or FIND subcommand, the value entered is
 used as the output format for subsequent LIST and FIND subcommands.
 Also, note the following:
   A. Formats NUM, SNUM and NONUM limit the search and display length
      for logical records to 256 characters.
   B. Formats BLOCK and DUMP apply to physical records; the other
      formats apply to logical records; and for load modules, LBLOCK
      and LDUMP formats apply to CSECT data.
   C. Formats LBLOCK, LDUMP, BLOCK and DUMP display only those
      segments of a record which contain the search string; however,
      a following segment will also be displayed if the string spans
      a segment boundary.

                format record or the first 8 bytes otherwise) of
                each logical record is examined; if the field is not
                numeric, formatting is switched to NONUM mode for the
                remainder of the member.

                For SPF-saved members, the high-order six digits of

=FIXPDS=FIXPD=FIXP=FIX
)F  Example -     FIXPDS release recfm(fba)

  The FIXPDS subcommand can perform several data set utility
  functions for sequential and partitioned data sets.

  After the FIXPDS subcommand gains control, it writes messages
  regarding the data set action to be taken and any potential error
  conditions.  FIXPDS will prompt the user before making any data set
  changes unless CONTROL NOPROMPT is in effect.

  Following are more detailed implementation notes on several of the
  different functions available through the FIXPDS subcommand:
    A.  EXPANDDIR (expand the directory -- ignored for sequential)
        1.  If no members exist in the data set, RESET is used
        2.  The names of any members that will be moved out of the
            way of the expanded directory are listed
        3.  If any of these members are in use by an SPF edit session,
            a warning message is issued
        4.  As each member is moved, an informational message is issued
        5.  The additional directory blocks are written
        6.  DCB is invoked to make any DCB changes
    B.  RESET (reset the directory and the data set)
        1.  If any members exist in the data set, a warning message
            is issued
        2.  If any members are in use by an SPF edit session, a
            warning message is issued
        3.  The data set's directory blocks are rewritten with null
            data, destroying any existing member information
        4.  The end of data marker (DS1LSTAR) is reset to indicate
            an empty partitioned data set
        5.  DCB is invoked to make any DCB changes
    C.  DCB (modify the DCB attributes)
        1.  If a data type keyword such as ASM, CLIST, CNTL, LOAD or
            OBJECT is entered, RECFM and LRECL default values are
            provided from a table and a BLKSIZE value is determined
            based on the allocated device type
        2.  If any RECFM, LRECL or BLKSIZE values are specifically
            requested by keyword, these values will override the
            values as determined from the above keywords.
        3.  The data set is opened for output with any new DCB
            parameters
    D.  RELEASE, RELEXTENT, RELSAVE (release unused space)
        1.  The TSO RELEASE command is called with operands
            corresponding to the keyword entered.
    E.  MAXSPACE (mark all allocated space in use)
        1.  All extents of the data set are marked in use by setting
            the end of data marker (DS1LSTAR) value to the last disk
            address for the data set.
        2.  This could be used in conjunction with a RESTORE subcommand
            to attempt to recover members which were deleted prior to a
            data set compress.


  Note: if the total number of directory blocks to be written will
  fill the last directory position on a disk track for the RESET
  or EXPANDDIR options, PDS45678 will add an extra padding directory
  block to ensure that the end of file marker is written on the
  following track.  This is done for compatibility with partitioned
  data set allocation.

  Caution: this subcommand modifies the data set. To ensure data set
  integrity, you should allocate the data set as OLD or be aware of
  the data set update protection provided by the PDS45678 command for
  SHR allocations (for details, enter HELP UPDATE).

 The FSE subcommand edits a member.  The TSO FSE command is used;
 both the FSE+ product from Applied Software, Inc. and the command
 called FSE from the CBT MVS SHARE tape (file 207) are compatable
 with the interface provided by this subcommand.

 If an EDIT type keyword is entered, that keyword is passed to FSE
 as the descriptive qualifier; otherwise, a descriptive qualifier is
 chosen as follows:
   A. If the low-level qualifier of the partitioned data set name is
      one of the valid descriptive qualifiers for FSE (ASM, BASIC,
      CLIST, CNTL, COBOL, DATA, IPLI, LIST, PLI, TEXT or VSBASIC),
      that qualifier is passed to FSE.
   B. If the low-level qualifier is FORT, GOFORT is passed to FSE.
   C. Otherwise, the data type qualifier is not a valid descriptive

)F  Example -     ISPMODE

  The ISPMODE subcommand switches PDS45678 to a full screen
  session display mode.  Subcommands entered and the outputs from
  internal PDS45678 subcommands are maintained in a session log.

  For more specific information on ISPMODE, enter the SPF HELP command
  while in ISPMODE.

  For additional information on the relationship of PDS45678 and
  the ISPMODE subcommand, enter HELP DIALOG.


  In the following, ISPMODE processing provided in PDS45678 is
  described in more detail:

   A.  When ISPMODE is active, the PUTLINE and PUTGET routines are
       monitored for data.

       1.  As each output line is added by PUTLINE, ISPMODE adds
           another session table entry.

       2.  If an output checkpoint (default is 250 output lines) is
           reached for a subcommand, ISPMODE positions the session
           display to the beginning of the output of this subcommand
           and allows the user to continue or terminate.  Note: this
           screen must be responded to before any PDS45678 subcommands
           may be entered.  Valid responses are as follows:
             a.  0   - continue with the subcommand's output
             b.  end - terminate the subcommand
             c.  an ISPF command or PF key

       3.  When a PUTGET is issued by PDS45678, ISPMODE positions the
           session display to the beginning of the output of the
           just completed subcommand.  A PDS45678 subcommand, an ISPF
           command, a PF key or an ISPMODE session control code may
           be entered at this time.


   B.  The ISPMODE session control codes are as follows:

       1 - Suspend ISPMODE: this control code terminates ISPMODE,
           retains the session log and enters line mode processing.
           ISPMODE can be restarted using the previous session log
           with another ISPMODE subcommand.  At the end of PDS45678
           processing, the session log is always discarded.

       2 - Clear log: discards all lines of the session log.

       3 - Clear below: clears the ISPMODE log lines below the
           top line displayed on the screen.

       4 - Clear above: clears the ISPMODE log above the top line
           displayed on the screen.

       6 - MEMLIST (all members): invokes a scrollable member list
           for all members.  PDS line commands can be entered on
           individual member lines.



  ISPMODE notes:

    1.  Only the first 79 characters of an output line are retained
        in the output table; this is a consideration for the LIST and
        FIND subcommands with output formats NUM, SNUM and NONUM.

    2.  FIND is a PDS45678 subcommand (not an ISPF command); you
        can not search the session log in any simple manner.

    3.  ISPF commands FIND, RFIND, RCHANGE, LEFT and RIGHT are not
        functional with ISPF table handling.

    4.  Subcommands END, HELP and TSO are intercepted by ISPF instead
        of the PDS45678 program; if you wish to use these subcommands,
        you must use an abbreviated name (EN, H, HE, HEL and T or TS).

    5.  Since ISPMODE only displays PDS45678 output at a checkpoint or
        at the completion of a subcommand, output from a subcommand
        cannot be monitored as it is produced.  Therefore, if PDS45678
        is in a CPU loop, the screen will lock until an attention is
        received.  At that time, any outputs generated will be
        displayed and an appropriate response may be given.

    6.  The EXEC processor does not work as usual; CLIST processing
        is not currently supported from ISPMODE or MEMLIST.

=LIST=L=LI=LIS
)F  Example -     LIST mema:memb

 The LIST subcommand displays data from a member.

 Unprintable characters for 3270-type devices are translated to periods
 before they are displayed.

 The LIST formats are NUM, SNUM, NONUM, LBLOCK, LDUMP, BLOCK and DUMP;
 for load modules, the NUM, SNUM and NONUM formats are equivalent
 to the LDUMP format.

 The default format is initially NUM; however, each time a format
 operand is entered on a LIST or FIND subcommand, the value entered is
 used as the output format for subsequent LIST and FIND subcommands.
 Also, note the following:
   A. Formats NUM, SNUM and NONUM limit the display length for logical
      records to 256 characters.
   B. Formats BLOCK and DUMP apply to physical records; the other
      formats apply to logical records; and for load modules, LBLOCK
      and LDUMP formats apply to CSECT data.

                For SPF-saved members, the high-order six digits of
                the line number field is formatted; otherwise, the

=OUTCOPY=OU=OUT=OUTC=OUTCO=OUTCOP
)F  Example -     OUTCOPY mema:memb

  The OUTCOPY subcommand formats utility control statements
  which can be used by IEBCOPY to select members from a data set.

  OUTCOPY does not utilize SPF services; however, when it is first
  invoked, it attempts to establish an SPF environment so that
  subsequent subcommands can utilize SPF services.

  OUTCOPY usage notes:
   A.  Output is directed to FILE(PDSOUT).
   B.  PDSOUT must be allocated to a sequential data set or to a
       member of a partitioned data set with fixed, 80 character
       records prior to entering the first OUTCOPY subcommand.
   C.  For new data sets, the default DCB attributes of
       DCB=(RECFM=FB,LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=3120)  will be used.
   D.  An IEBCOPY COPY statement is written before the first SELECT
       statement for each data set as determined by the CHANGE
       subcommand; the COPY statement is of the form:
       COPY  OUTDD=OUTPUT,INDD=xxx
       where xxx is the low-level qualifier of the input data set name.
   E.  The default IEBCOPY select statement is of the form:
       S M=memname ,memname))
       Note -- memname is the member name; this format output statement
       can be modified by an editor if member rename or member replace
       functions are to be performed.

       If TEXT('Any String') was specified, each subsequent IEBCOPY
       statement changes to the form:
          S M=memname  ANY STRING
   F.  OUTCOPY maintains a list of member names written after each
       copy statement and does not output a member name more than once.
   G.  A CLIST such as the following could be established for IEBCOPY
       use:
        PROC 3 FROMDSN FROMQUAL TODSN CONTROLS(PDSOUT.CNTL)
        ALLOC F(SYSIN) DA(&CONTROLS.) SHR
        ALLOC F(SYSPRINT) DA(*)
        ALLOC F(&FROMQUAL.) DA(&FROMDSN.) SHR
        ALLOC F(OUTPUT) DA(&TODSN.) OLD
        CALL 'SYS1.LINKLIB(IEBCOPY)'

   H.  Assuming that OUTCOPY has created output in PDSOUT.CNTL, you
       could copy selected members from your LIB.LOAD data set to
       'SYS1.LINKLIB2', by entering the following line from
       READY mode:
       %copyout lib.load load 'sys1.linklib2'

=PATTERN=P=PA=PAT=PATT=PATTE=PATTER
)F  Example -     PATTERN  pds/70

   The PATTERN subcommand lists member names from the data set
   directory.  Only those member names which contain the PATTERN
   name segments specified are displayed.  Note that the default
   member group is not affected by the DISPLAY or PATTERN subcommands.

   One or two member name segments may be entered as patterns.  If two
   segments are entered, both segments must occur in a member name for
   it to be displayed.  For example, with the pattern segments xx and
   1x, members named M1X4XX, M1XX and XX1X would be displayed by this
   subcommand while members named X1X or MXX13X would not be displayed.

   Note that -A is added following a displayed member name if the
   member name is an alias.  The member name is listed in a combined
   hexadecimal/character format if it does not contain upper case
   alphanumeric characters (including @, $ and #) or if the first
   character is numeric.  Unprintable characters (for 3270-type
   devices) in a member name are displayed as periods.

  The RENAME subcommand updates a member's name.

  If a non-alias load module is renamed, any associated alias directory
  entries will be updated to reflect the new base module name.

  Note: if a non-alias load module is renamed to itself, any
  associated alias entries will be checked and updated as needed.

  Caution: this subcommand modifies the data set. To ensure data set
  integrity, you should allocate the data set as OLD or be aware of
  the data set update protection provided by the PDS45678 command for

))NOGROUP - only the member specifically identified is to be renamed.
=RESTORE=RES=REST=RESTO=RESTOR
)F  Example -     PROMPT oldname 0 prompt

  The RESTORE subcommand resurrects a deleted member at the given
  TTR address.  Note that deleted members remain in a partitioned
  data set until the data set is compressed.

  It may be possible to restore a member deleted prior to a compress
  operation if you mark all of the data set's space as "in use" with
  a "FIXPDS MAXSPACE" statement before the restore attempt.

  The LIKE operand of RESTORE can assign SSI information to a restored
  member based on a model member or it can copy SPF statistics to
  non-load members.

  The attributes authorized, not editable, not executable, only
  loadable, page boundary, reentrant, refreshable and reusable can
  not be determined from load module records; however, these attributes
  can be assigned based on a model member with the LIKE operand or they
  may be selectively assigned with the ATTRIB subcommand.

  If the data set is a load library, then if the member name is an
  imbedded external name within the load module, that external name
  will be used as the entry point; otherwise, the first CSECT in the
  load module will be used as the entry point.

  Caution: this subcommand modifies the data set. To ensure data set
  integrity, you should allocate the data set as OLD or be aware of
  the data set update protection provided by the PDS45678 command for
  SHR allocations (for details, enter HELP UPDATE).

 The VERIFY subcommand validity checks data sets.  For partitioned
 data sets, the entire data set may be checked by entering : in the
 member name position; an individual member or member group may be
 checked by entering its name in the member name position.

 VERIFY checks partitioned data sets in the following manner:
  A.  For VERIFY : UPDATE, a dummy member is added and deleted to
      determine if the data set directory is full and if normal PDS
      functions are possible.
  B.  The data set directory is read, member names are placed into
      a program table in TTR sort order and the following checks
      are performed:
      1.  If NAME is in effect, member names are checked for validity.
      2.  If the data set is a load library, the following linkage
          editor attribute combinations are illegal:
          a.  Modules with RENT and NOREUS attributes
          b.  Modules with RMODEANY and AMODE24 or AMODEANY attributes
          c.  Modules with OVLY and RENT, REUS, REFR, SCTR, RMODEANY,

          d.  Modules with TEST and NOEDIT attributes
          e.  Modules with REUS and SCTR attributes
      3.  If LOAD is in effect and the data set is a load library,
          each member is checked for ABENDS as it is LOADED.
      4.  Each member is checked for current usage by an SPF EDIT
          session.
      5.  Member directory entries are checked for correct name order.
      6.  Each member's TTR address is checked against the end of
          the data set.
  C.  The program TTR table is checked for:
      1.  Orphan members (aliases with no associated main member).
      2.  Apparent alias members (main members whose start address
          matches another main member's start address).
      3.  Alias load modules whose directory pointers to associated
          main members are incorrect.
      4.  Alias load modules whose RMODE entries or main AMODE entries
          do not match their base module's entries.
  D.  If READ or INPUT is in effect, the directory and each member
      is read checking for:
      1.  Permanent I/O errors
      2.  Input blocksizes exceeding the DCB BLKSIZE
      3.  Input blocksizes/LRECL not an integral if RECFM=F

=ABEND=ABEN=ABE=AB=ESTAE=ESTAI=STAE
)F
 The ABEND HELP entry is provided to explain ABEND processing
 performed by PDS45678. PDS45678 attempts to recover from ABENDS with
 its ESTAE and ESTAI recovery routines unless CONTROL NORECOVER is
 in effect.


 In the following, the ABEND processing provided by PDS45678 is
 described in more detail:

  A.  The PDS45678 program uses different recovery methods depending
      on the subcommand being executed.  The method used will
      perform any cleanup and initialization functions required to
      restart PDS45678.

  B.  For internal PDS45678 subcommands, recovery is performed by
      writing an error message and terminating the subcommand.

  C.  For the external subcommands BROWSE, EDIT, or ISPF, no ESTAE
      recovery is attempted.

  D.  For the other external PDS45678 subcommands (COMPARE, COMPRESS,
      DSPRINT, EXEC, FSE, HELP, PRINTOFF, REVIEW, SUBMIT, TSO xxx,
      TSOEDIT and TSOLIST), the subcommand processor is forcibly
      detached.

  E.  If CONTROL NORECOVER is in effect, PDS45678 will terminate unless
      the subcommand being used specifically tests for ABEND conditions
      (such as IF with LOADERR or VERIFY with LOAD).

  F.  If CONTROL RECOVER is in effect, any ABEND dump will probably
      not be very useful; also, if you want to use TSO TEST after an
      ABEND, it is recommended that you set CONTROL NORECOVER first.

  G.  Certain external programs reached via the TSO subcommand (such
      as CALL) will terminate PDS45678 with a "READY" message if the
      program they invoke ABENDS.  Note, however, that if a null line
      is entered at this point, PDS45678 will regain control.
)X SYNTAX -        none.
)O OPERANDS -      none.
=ATTN=PA1=ATTE=ATTEN=ATTENT=ATTENTI=ATTENTIO
)F
 The ATTN HELP entry is provided to explain the attention processing
 performed by PDS45678. In general, an attention (the PA1 key) may be
 used to terminate the current PDS45678 subcommand and two attentions
 in a row may be used to terminate the PDS45678 command.


 In the following, the attention processing provided by PDS45678 is
 described in more detail:

  A.  An single (double for TSOEDIT) attention should terminate any
      member group in progress (except for the FSE subcommand).

  B.  An attention at a prompt for a data set should terminate PDS45678.

  C.  An attention at the normal ENTER OPTION subcommand prompt
      should provide another ENTER OPTION prompt; another attention
      at this point should terminate PDS45678.

  D.  For subcommands BROWSE, EDIT, ISPF, ISPMODE, or MEMLIST,
      no ENTER OPTION prompt is provided by PDS45678's attention
      handling:
       a.  A single attention should terminate any member group in
           progress.
       b.  Any additional attentions should be ignored by PDS45678.
       c.  For TSO commands invoked by SPF with no attention
           handling:  the first attention is noted by PDS45678 and it
           will terminate any member group in progress; subsequent
           attentions apply only to the TSO command.

  E.  For the COMPRESS subcommand, attentions are ignored until the
      attached program terminates to protect the integrity of the
      target data set.

  F.  For other PDS45678 subcommands, an single (double for TSOEDIT)
      attention should result in an ENTER OPTION prompt; the
      processing action taken at this point depends on what is
      entered next:
       1.  Another attention should terminate the PDS45678 command.
       2.  A null line should cause the interrupted subcommand to
           continue at the point of interruption.  Note: any messages
           awaiting output at the time of the interrupt will be lost.
       3.  If a subcommand is entered and the currently executing
           subcommand is external to PDS45678 (COMPARE, DSPRINT, EXEC,
           FSE, HELP, PRINTOFF, REVIEW, SUBMIT, TSO xxx, TSOEDIT or
           TSOLIST), the command processor should be forcibly detached
           and the ABEND message should be suppressed.
       4.  An entered subcommand should be given control without delay.

  G.  If an internal PDS45678 subcommand is in a loop that does not
      involve input or output to the terminal or input from the current
      data set, a single attention will not terminate the loop:
       1.  The first attention will provide the normal ENTER OPTION
           prompt.
       2.  If a subcommand is entered at this time, PDS45678 will
           continue looping.
       3.  Another attention will produce the message
           "WARNING: POSSIBLE PROGRAM LOOP" and PDS45678 will perform
           the subcommand entered at the ENTER OPTION prompt.

=DEFINE=DEF=DEFI=DEFIN
)F
 The DEFINE HELP entry is provided to explain terminology used
 in the PDS45678 program and in its documentation:

 PDS or Partitioned Data Set - a data set with fixed, variable or
 undefined format which is commonly used as a "library" for related
 types of information.  Partitioned data sets contain two segments
 of data: a directory of information and member data.

 PDS directory -  a segment of a PDS which is a sequential data set
 with eight byte keys and 256 byte data records containing pointers
 to data in the PDS member portion of the data set.

 PDS member data - a segment of a PDS which contains current members
 (which are pointed to by one or more directory entries) and inactive
 or deleted members (which have no associated directory entries).

 PDS directory entry - a logical entry in a PDS directory which points
 to its associated data in the member data; it consists of an eight
 character member name field and at least one three character relative
 address field.

 Load library -  a partitioned data set which has record format U, UA
 or UM and is commonly used to contain executable modules.

 Member -  data in a partitioned data set (or PDS) which is pointed
 to by one or more PDS directory entries.

 Load module -  a member contained in a load library.

 Alias member -  a directory entry with a indicator value which
 indicates that the member entry is an alternate name for another
 main member; a main member and its aliases are associated with
 the same recorded data in the PDS.

 Main member -  a non-alias directory entry and its associated
 recorded data.

 Orphan member - an member marked as an alias which does not have
 an associated main member.

 Deleted member -  member data which is not pointed to by any
 directory entry; deleted members remain in a PDS until the
 data set is compressed.

 Apparent alias member -  data in a partitioned data set which is
 pointed to by more than one main PDS directory entry.

=DIALOG=DIA=DIAL=DIALO
)F
 The DIALOG HELP entry is provided to explain the processing
 relationships of SPF and the PDS45678 subcommands which use SPF
 dialog services.

 Note: the OUTCOPY subcommand and the CONTROL SYSOUT/DSNAME operands
 do not use SPF services; however, when they are first entered, they
 attempt to establish an SPF environment so that SPF services can be
 utilized by subsequent PDS45678 subcommands; the BROWSE, EDIT, ISPF,
 ISPMODE and MEMLIST subcommands do required SPF services.


 PDS45678 is a TSO command processor and can gain control in any of the
 following modes:

 A.  From READY mode:
     When the first subcommand utilizing or initializing SPF services
     is entered, PDS45678 calls an SPF interface which invokes PDS45678
     recursively as an SPF dialog; SPF services are then directly
     invoked for each subsequent BROWSE, EDIT, ISPF, ISPMODE or
     MEMLIST subcommand.

 B.  From SPF option 6 or the TSO subcommand of ISPF:
     SPF can not be used; this restriction may be removed in future
     versions of ISPF.

 C.  From another TSO command processor:
     If an SPF environment has been established by an earlier command
     processor, SPF services can not be used; otherwise, when the
     first subcommand utilizing or initializing SPF services is
     entered, PDS45678 calls an SPF interface which invokes PDS45678
     recursively as an SPF dialog; SPF services are then directly
     invoked for each subsequent BROWSE, EDIT, ISPF, ISPMODE or
     MEMLIST subcommand.

 D.  From the PDSSEL panel in SPF:
     PDS45678 is invoked as an SPF dialog; PDS45678 locates and creates
     the required command processor control blocks and can invoke SPF
     services directly.
)X SYNTAX -        none.
)O OPERANDS -      none.
=GROUPS=G=GR=GRO=GROU=GROUP=GROUP.
)F
 The GROUP HELP entry is provided to explain the various member
 name forms allowed.  Member names may be entered in either character
 or hexadecimal mode for any subcommand which processes member names.

 Character member names may be from one to eight bytes long with no
 imbedded blanks, commas, parentheses, colons or slashes.

 Hexadecimal member names may contain from one to sixteen hexadecimal
 digits delimited by x' and '.  X'd7c4e2f9' and PDS9 are entirely
 equivalent; also, x'333' and x'0333' are equivalent.


 Subcommands ATTRIB, BROWSE, DELETE, DIRENTRY, DSPRINT, EDIT, FIND,
 FSE, IF, HISTORY, LIST, MAP, MEMBERS, MEMLIST, OUTCOPY, PRINTOFF,
 REVIEW, SUBMIT, TSOEDIT, TSOLIST and VERIFY allow additional member
 name specifications.

 A member name range or member name pattern forms what is termed a
 member group.  Note that a member list (that is, a parenthesized
 list containing member and member group specifications separated by
 commas) may also be used.

 When a member group is being processed, the subcommand processing
 routine is re-executed for each member in the group.  Specifically,
 note the following:

  A.  Default member name -- if no member name is specified, the
      last member name or member group entered for any of the above
      subcommands will be assumed.

  B.  Asterisk member name -- if * is entered in the member name
      position, the last member name or member group entered for
      any of the above subcommands will be assumed.

  C.  Member name range -- any of these subcommands may select all
      members in a range by specifying a beginning partial member
      name, a colon, and a ending partial member name (either or
      both of the partial names may be null).

      Logic from the DISPLAY subcommand is used to select members;
      the subcommand processes these selected members in alphabetic
      order.  The following specifications would select the same
      member names:
            subcommand  :              and    DISPLAY
            subcommand  part1:         and    DISPLAY  part1
            subcommand  :part2         and    DISPLAY  x'00' part2
            subcommand  part1:part2    and    DISPLAY  part1 part2

  D.  Member name pattern -- any of these subcommands may select all
      members whose names contain pattern characters by specifying a
      member name segment, a slash, and another member name segment
      (either, not both, of the member name segments may be null).

      Logic from the PATTERN subcommand is used to select members;
      the subcommand processes these selected members in alphabetic
      order.  The following specifications would select the same
      member names:
            subcommand  seg1/          and    PATTERN  seg1
            subcommand  /seg2          and    PATTERN  seg2
            subcommand  seg1/seg2      and    PATTERN  seg1 seg2

  E.  Member name display subcommands -- MEMBERS, PATTERN and DISPLAY
      allow the display of member groups using the above member group
      syntax; however, these subcommands differ as follows:
       1.  DISPLAY -- can not modify the current member group;
           if no member specification is entered, the entire
           member directory is displayed.
       2.  PATTERN -- can not modify the current member group;
           if no member specification is entered, the member group
           last entered on a PATTERN subcommand is displayed.
       3.  MEMBERS -- can modify the current member group;
           if no member specification is entered, the current
           member group is displayed.

  F.  Following are examples using the MEMBERS subcommand to
      define and display a member group:

        SUBCOMMAND         MEMBERS IN THE GROUP
        ----------         --------------------
        MEMBERS aa         AA
        MEMBERS (aa,bb)    AA and BB
        MEMBERS (aa,bb/)   AA and any member names containing BB

        MEMBERS :          all members -- X'00' through X'FF'
        MEMBERS aa:        members from AA... through X'FF'

        MEMBERS aa:bb      members between AA... and BB...
        MEMBERS aa/        member names containing AA
        MEMBERS /bb        member names containing BB
        MEMBERS (aa/,bb/)  member names containing AA or BB

=LIMITS=LIM=LIMI=LIMIT
)F
 The LIMITS HELP entry is provided to list PDS45678 limitations
 which might impact the program's usefulness at an installation:

   1.  Member lists may have up to 50 entries.  The following example
       subcommand specifies all possible member list entries:
       PRINTOFF (mg1:mgx1,mg2/,mg3:mgx3, ... mg50/) form(0012)

   2.  In the ISPMODE or MEMLIST panels, a maximum of 48 characters
       may be entered as a subcommand; otherwise, a maximum of 256
       characters may be entered.  Note that this may limit the
       subcommands which can be entered.

   3.  For ISPMODE panels, only the first 79 characters of an output
       line are available for display; this is a consideration for
       the LIST and FIND subcommands with output formats NUM, SNUM
       and NONUM.

   4.  For session outputs via CONTROL DSNAME or SYSOUT, only the
       first 80 characters of an output line are retained; this is
       also a consideration for the LIST and FIND subcommands with
       output formats NUM, SNUM and NONUM.

   5.  For MEMLIST panels, only eight bytes of operand information
       may be entered as an operand in a line command after the
       member name.

   6.  For subcommands FIND and IF, the THEN and ELSE keywords may
       contain only a subcommand name (operands are not permitted).
       As a consequence, only the default action for the named
       subcommand may be performed using the current member.

)X SYNTAX -        none.
)O OPERANDS -      none.
=UPDATE=UP=UPD=UPDA=UPDAT=SHR=SH
)F
 The UPDATE HELP entry is provided to explain the update data
 set protection implemented for certain PDS45678 subcommands.

 If the data set is allocated as OLD, the STOW DCB is left open after
 the first data set update.  For OLD allocations, exclusive use of the
 data set is assured and the following does not apply.

 If the data set is allocated as SHR (SHR was specifically requested
 or SHR was defaulted to), PDS45678 subcommands which update the data
 set such as ALIAS, ATTRIB (with attributes to be changed), DELETE,
 FIXPDS, RENAME, RESTORE or VERIFY could cause data set integrity
 problems if the data set is also being updated by another user.


 To circumvent this problem, PDS45678 uses the following SPF RESERVE
 logic to maintain data set integrity during data set updates.

  A.  A  RESERVE  (SPFEDIT,DSNAME,E,44,SYSTEMS),UCB=ADDRESS
      is performed.

  B.  If the data set is a load library, then a linkage editor
      RESERVE or ENQUE is performed as appropriate:
       1.  On a shared DASDI volume,
           RESERVE  (SYSIEWLP,DSNAME,E,44,SYSTEMS),UCB=ADDRESS
       2.  On a non-shared DASDI volume,
           ENQ  (SYSIEWLP,DSNAME,E,44,SYSTEM)

  C.  The data set STOW DCB is opened

  D.  All data set updates are performed.
       1.  Wherever possible, the STOW DCB is left open while
           an entire member group is being processed.
       2.  For executions of PDS45678 in batch mode, the volume
           reserve is maintained and the STOW DCB is left open
           following the first update to the data set.

  E.  The data set STOW DCB is closed

  F.  DEQ's are performed to remove the RESERVE's and ENQ's

 The MESSAGE HELP entry is provided to document PDS45678 program
 messages.

 PDS45678 messages are of the format PDSnnnx (where nnn is numeric and
 x is the letter I, A, W or E).  The program messages are grouped in
 numeric ranges by message severity as shown below:

))PDS400W NO MEMBERS ARE IN THE DATA SET

   This data set has no members whose names are in this range of names.

))PDS402W NO MEMBER NAMES MATCH THIS PATTERN
   This data set has no members whose names match these pattern
   characters.

))PDS450W ONE EXTRA PADDING DIRECTORY BLOCK WILL BE ADDED
   FIXPDS will add one additional directory block to the directory
   because the total number of directory blocks equals the number of
   directory blocks which exactly fit on a disk track boundary.

   Adding a directory block forces the end of file marker for the
   directory to the following track and circumvents various IEBCOPY
   problems.

   This circumvention is required because of an inconsistency
   between allocation and the SAM access methods used by FIXPDS.

   For example on a 3380, a data set with 46 directory blocks will
   have its directory end of file marker placed at the beginning of
   the second track by allocation; however, the SAM access methods
   sometimes place the directory end of file marker at the end of
   the first track.

))PDS451W ALL MEMBERS IN THIS PDS WILL BE LOST
   FIXPDS RESET deletes all members from the data set.

))PDS460W NO HISTORY DATA IS AVAILABLE
   This module has no associated history (translator, zap or user-

   linkage editor.

))PDS470W THE PROGRAM IS PROBABLY IN A LOOP
   The previous attention was noted but an interruption point was
   not encountered in the program before this attention.

   Interruptions are checked for at a terminal input or output and
   when the input data set is read.

   This message usually means that the program is in a loop --
   the looping subcommand will be terminated and the subcommand
   that was last entered will be given control.

))PDS480W COMPRESS IS IN PROGRESS
   A compress has been initiated.

   Compress is performed in-place on your data set; if IEBCOPY does
   not complete its operation for any reason, the data set should be
   checked with a VERIFY subcommand.

  PDS480W COMPRESS MAY NOT BE INTERRUPTED
   Attentions received during a compress operation are ignored since
   the target data set may be destroyed if IEBCOPY does not complete.

))PDS482W BLOCKSIZE SHOULD BE EVENLY DIVISIBLE BY THE DCB LRECL
   The requested BLKSIZE is not a multiple of the logical record

   Due to missing or invalid APF data, the APF value was not modified.
   A module linked with an old linkage editor might not have APF data.

))PDS723E THE RLD/CONTROL COUNT CAN NOT BE CHANGED
   Due to non-existent RLD/control data in the member, the directory
   RLD/control count was not modified.  Note that a module linked with

))PDS750E A REQUIRED NOTELIST POINTER WAS NOT FOUND IN THIS MEMBER
   Due to an error condition, one or more load module records referred
   to in an overlay notelist record could not be located by FIXPDS.

   This message may be due to data set or equipment errors.  A VERIFY
   subcommand may provide more information.

   The EXPANDDIR operation is terminated with the member in error
   unchanged.  Any previously moved members and their associated
   aliases are fully updated, however.

   If this problem is due to data set errors, the data set may be
   damaged and should be recovered.

))PDS751E A NOTELIST RECORD COULD NOT BE FOUND FOR THIS MEMBER
   Due to an error condition, an overlay notelist record could not
   be input by FIXPDS.

   This message may be due to data set or equipment errors.  A VERIFY
   subcommand may provide more information.

   The EXPANDDIR operation is terminated with the member in error
   unchanged.  Any previously moved members and their associated
   aliases are fully updated, however.

   If this problem is due to data set errors, the data set may be
   damaged and should be recovered.

))PDS752E THE NUMBER OF DESIRED DIRECTORY BLOCKS MUST BE SPECIFIED
   Due to a previously noted error condition, the number of directory
   blocks could not be determined.  Therefore, the number of directory
   blocks must be specified to expand or reset the data set directory.

))PDS770E THE FIRST FIND SUBCOMMAND MUST CONTAIN A STRING
   A default find string cannot be used since no default string has
   been established yet.

))PDS771E name IS AN INVALID SUBCOMMAND; ENTER "HELP" OR "OPTIONS" ...

   subcommand names follows this header.

))PDS780E filename DCB OPEN ERROR -- REALLOCATE AND TRY AGAIN
   The FILE(PDSOUT) or session copy data set could not be opened;
   correct any problems with the current allocation and try again.

))PDS781E filename DCB ATTRIBUTES CONFLICT -- USE SEQUENTIAL WITH
   RECFM=FB AND LRECL=80
   The attributes of the FILE(PDSOUT) and the session copy data set
   must be RECFM(F B) LRECL(80) with a blocksize which is a multiple
   of 80.  It must be allocated to a sequential output data set or a
   member of a partitioned data set.

))PDS800E NO LOAD MODULE TEXT WAS FOUND FOR MEMBER
   This member contains invalid load module data and it cannot
   be restored.

))PDS801E END OF MEMBER SIMULATED -- REMAINDER OF TRACK SKIPPED
   Due to a previously noted input error, the remainder of the
   track cannot be read.  RESTORE will begin processing with the
   following track as if it were the beginning of a new member.

))PDS802E A MAIN MEMBER NAMED member IS ALREADY AT THIS TTR
   The identified main member resides at this location; RESTORE
   terminates after checking for other associated members.

))PDS804E RESTORE ABANDONED
   Due to a previously noted error condition, RESTORE cannot continue.
   You may wish to retry RESTORE with different operands.

))PDS805E INVALID LOAD MODULE DATA
   This member contains invalid load module data and it cannot
   be restored.

))PDS811E RECORD LENGTH n IS INVALID
   The indicated logical record length (0, 1, 2 or 3) is invalid for
   RECFM(V) data sets.

   This type of error usually indicates that your data set DCB has
   been altered.  If this is the case, the data set DCB can be reset
   by the following subcommand:
     FIXPDS RECFM(mm) LRECL(nn) BLKSIZE(pp)
     (where mm, nn and pp are replaced by the proper DCB attributes)

))PDS812E BLOCK LENGTH OF nn,nnn EXCEEDS THE DATA SET DCB BLKSIZE
   The physical blocksize exceeds the BLKSIZE of the data set.

   This type of error usually indicates that your data set DCB has
   been altered.  If this is the case, the data set DCB can be reset
   by the following subcommand:
     FIXPDS RECFM(mm) LRECL(nn) BLKSIZE(pp)
     (where mm, nn and pp are replaced by the proper DCB attributes)

))PDS813E RECORD LENGTH OF nn,nnn EXCEEDS THE MAXIMUM DCB LRECL
   The logical record length exceeds the LRECL of the data set.

   This type of error usually indicates that your data set DCB has
   been altered.  If this is the case, the data set DCB can be reset
   by the following subcommand:
     FIXPDS RECFM(mm) LRECL(nn) BLKSIZE(pp)
     (where mm, nn and pp are replaced by the proper DCB attributes)

))PDS814E BLOCK LENGTH OF nn,nnn IS NOT DIVISIBLE BY THE DCB LRECL
   The physical blocksize is not a multiple of the data set's LRECL.

   This type of error usually indicates that your data set DCB has
   been altered.  If this is the case, the data set DCB can be reset
   by the following subcommand:
     FIXPDS RECFM(mm) LRECL(nn) BLKSIZE(pp)
     (where mm, nn and pp are replaced by the proper DCB attributes)

))PDS820E THIS MEMBER IS AN ALIAS FOR member1 BUT IT POINTS TO member2
   This member is actually an alias for main member member1 (according
   to its TTR), but its directory entry indicates that it should be an
   alias of member2.

   This is usually caused by doing a rename of a main module with
   some utility which does not update the associated alias modules'
   directory entries correctly.

   This type of error could cause serious problems if the members are
   in your LPALIB (you may not be able to IPL).

   To correct this problem with PDS45678, issue the following
   subcommand:
     RENAME member1 member1
        (where member1 is the name of the main module identified above)

))PDS821E RMODE ENTRY DOES NOT CORRESPOND WITH MEMBER member
   The residence mode entry for this alias member does not match the
   residence mode entry of the identified main module.

   This type of error is unusual; the main module and its aliases
   should be reinstalled.

   To correct this problem with PDS45678, issue the following
   subcommands:
     ATTRIB member
        (where member is the main member identified above).
     ATTRIB member RMODExx
        (where RMODExx is the RMODE value displayed
         by the above ATTRIB subcommand)

))PDS822E MAIN AMODE ENTRY DOES NOT CORRESPOND WITH MEMBER member
   The addressing mode entry for this alias member does not match
   the addressing mode entry of the identified main module.

   This type of error is unusual; the main module and its aliases
   should be reinstalled.

   To correct this problem with PDS45678, issue the following
   subcommands:
     ATTRIB member
        (where member is the main member identified above).
     ATTRIB member AMODExx
        (where AMODExx is the AMODE value displayed
         by the above ATTRIB subcommand)

))PDS823E RLD/CONTROL COUNT DOES NOT CORRESPOND WITH MEMBER member
   The RLD/control count for this alias member does not match
   the RLD/control count of the identified main module.

   This type of error is unusual; the main module and its aliases
   should be reinstalled.

   In MVS/XA, this count field is used by program fetch to construct
   a channel program that will load the member.

   If this error is not resolved before program fetch uses this member,
   fetch may operate in a degraded mode.

   To correct this problem with PDS45678, issue the following
   subcommand for the main module and each of its aliases:
     ATTRIB memberx RLDFIX

))PDS824E DUPLICATE MEMBER NAME -- IGNORED
   This member name has previously been encountered in the data set
   directory.

   Your data set has been damaged -- it should be recovered in some
   fashion; it may suffice to just delete one of the duplicate member
   names.

))PDS825E MEMBER NAME IS OUT OF SEQUENCE -- IGNORED
   Member names higher in the collating sequence than this member name
   have previously been encountered in the data set directory.

   Your data set has been damaged -- it should be recovered in some
   fashion; it may suffice to delete the out-of-sequence member
   name or the member name just before this one in the directory.

))PDS826E THE DIRECTORY RLD/CONTROL COUNT DOES NOT MATCH THE FIRST RLD
   ENTRY
   The RLD/control count for this member does not match the number
   of RLD or control records following the first TEXT record.

   In MVS/XA, this count field is used by program fetch to construct
   a channel program that will load the member.

   If this error is not resolved before program fetch uses this member,
   fetch may operate in a degraded mode.

   To correct this problem with PDS45678, issue the following
   subcommand for the main module and each of its aliases:
     ATTRIB memberx RLDFIX

))PDS827E member1 IS AN ALIAS FOR THIS MEMBER BUT IT POINTS TO member2
   Member1 is actually an alias for this main member (according to its
   TTR), but its directory entry indicates that it should be an alias
   of member2.

   This is usually caused by doing a rename of a main module with
   some utility which does not update the associated alias modules'
   directory entries correctly.

   This type of error could cause serious problems if the members are
   in your LPALIB (you may not be able to IPL).

   To correct this problem with PDS45678, issue the following
   subcommand:
     RENAME mmember mmember
        (where mmember is the name of the main member)

))PDS830E OBTAIN ERROR -- PROGRAM TERMINATED
   The data set name could not be found in the VTOC (Volume Table of
   Contents); this is probably a program error.

))PDS831E UNABLE TO OPEN DATA SET
   The open for the input data set failed; this is probably a
   program error.

))PDS832E DUMMY MEMBER ADD FAILED, RC=8
   A dummy member, with name 9FIXPDS, was not added as expected to
   the data set directory; this is probably a program error.

))PDS833E DUMMY MEMBER DELETE FAILED, RC=8
   A dummy member, with name 9FIXPDS, was not deleted as expected from
   the data set directory; this is probably a program error.

))PDS834E ERROR IN GENERAL FAIL SERVICE ROUTINE; R15=nn
   The general FAIL system message routine failed with the indicated
   return code; this is probably a program error.

))PDS835E ERROR IN DAIRFAIL SERVICE ROUTINE; R15=nn
   The DAIRFAIL system message routine failed with the indicated return
   code; this is probably a program error.

))PDS836E I/O ERROR IN DIRECTORY
   The system directory management routines indicate that the directory
   for this data set contains one or more I/O errors.

   This I/O error may be due to data set or equipment errors; entering
   a VERIFY subcommand may provide more information.

   Data set recovery will be required if this is a data set error.

))PDS840E INVALID HEXADECIMAL STRING LENGTH
   At most 32 hexadecimal digits may be used for a search string.

))PDS841E INVALID HEXADECIMAL CHARACTERS
   Only numeric characters and the characters from A through F may be
   used in hexadecimal strings.

))PDS842E THIS SEARCH STRING IS TOO LONG
   At most 16 characters may be used for a search string.

))PDS843E ONLY DISK DATA SETS ARE SUPPORTED
   The target data set must exist on disk.

))PDS844E FILE(filename) HAS CONCATENATED DATA SETS -- ONLY INDIVIDUAL
  DATA SETS ARE SUPPORTED
   Concatenated data sets are not supported.

))PDS850E member IS BEING UPDATED BY username
   This member is being modified by the named user or JOB; this member
   is currently owned by the indicated user or JOB and its status can
   not be changed.

))PDS851E THIS DATA SET IS BEING UPDATED BY username
   This data set is being modified by the named user or JOB; this data
   set is currently owned by the indicated user or JOB and its status
   can not be changed.

))PDS852E member ALREADY EXISTS
   This member cannot be added to the data set; this member name is
   already in the data set.

))PDS853E member NOT FOUND
   This member is not in the data set.

))PDS854E member IS AN INVALID MEMBER NAME
   This member name is invalid; member names may be entered in either
   character or hexadecimal mode.

   Character member names may be from one to eight bytes long with no
   imbedded blanks, commas, parentheses, colons or slashes.

   Hexadecimal member names may contain from one to sixteen hexadecimal
   digits delimited by x' and '.  Note: x'd7c4e2f9' and PDS9 are
   entirely equivalent; also, x'333' and x'0333' are equivalent.

))PDS855E THE DATA SET DIRECTORY IS FULL AND MEMBERS CANNOT BE ADDED
   The directory is full; if you are currently trying to save a member
   using an editor, you may wish to save it in another data set).

   This type of problem can be resolved in several ways:
     1.  clean up the directory of the data set by deleting obsolete
         members and make room for new member names.
     2.  split the data set into two (or more) data sets.
     3.  reallocate the data set (with a larger directory) and copy
         all old members to the replacement data set.
     4.  expand the directory with FIXPDS.  For example, enter
         FIXPDS EXPAND(30)  to add 30 directory blocks.

))PDS860E MEMBER IS AN ALIAS BUT NO MAIN MEMBER EXISTS
   This alias member has no associated main member.  This type of
   alias member is termed an orphan.

   This type of error is usually caused by not linking a main module
   and all of its aliases; the main module and its aliases should be
   reinstalled.

   To correct this problem with PDS45678, issue the following
   subcommands for each identified orphan member:
     DELETE memberz
        (where memberz is the orphan member)
     ALIAS memberx memberz
        (where memberx is the correct main member)

))PDS861E THE ALIAS DIRECTORY ENTRY NOTES THE MAIN MEMBER NAME AS membr
   This message displays the name of the main member for this alias
   member as noted by its directory entry.

))PDS862E ERROR IN GQSCAN DATA
   This message indicates that ENQUEUE check parameters are incorrect;
   this is probably a program error.

))PDS864E member IS AN APPARENT ALIAS FOR THIS MEMBER
   This member and the identified member both point to the same TTR
   address but neither has its alias bit set.

   These members are called apparent aliases and the actual owner
   of the member data can not be determined.

   This type of error is unusual; if the data set is copied or
   compressed, IEBCOPY should fix this situation by creating two
   identical members during the copy.

   To correct this problem with PDS45678, determine which apparent
   alias member name should correspond to the member data and issue
   the following subcommand:
     DELETE memberx
        (where memberx is the non-corresponding alias name)

))PDS865E THE IEBCOPY OUTPUT CAN NOT BE OPENED
   A compress has been performed but a summary of IEBCOPY's messages
   cannot be provided since the message data set can not be opened.

   This is probably a program error.

))PDS870E PDS DIRECTORIES MUST BE CONTAINED IN ONE EXTENT
   The directory of a partitioned data set must be totally contained in
   the first extent of the data set.

   From VERIFY, it indicates that your data set was allocated with a
   invalid directory and the data set should not be used as it may
   fail in program load or when used by IEBCOPY.

   From FIXPDS, it indicates that your data set will require more than
   its first extent to contain the expanded (or reset) directory.
   This is not permitted as it would create an invalid data set
   directory.

))PDS871E A TTR FOR THIS MEMBER WAS NOT FOUND
   Due to an error condition, a record pointed by this member's
   directory entry could not be found in this load module.

   This message may be due to data set or equipment errors.  A VERIFY
   subcommand may provide more information.

   If this error occurs in FIXPDS, the subcommand is terminated before
   changing the member in error.  Any previously moved members and
   their associated aliases are fully updated, however.

   If this problem is due to data set errors, the data set may be
   damaged and should be recovered.

))PDS872E THIS MEMBER IS AFTER THE DATA SET END-OF-FILE
   This member's data follows the end of data set marker (DS1LSTAR)
   input at the last open of this data set by PDS45678.

   If another user has saved into the data set, enter a change
   subcommand to the same data set and try this subcommand again.

   If this is not sucessful, it indicates that your data set contains
   one or more invalid TTR pointers and that the data set has been
   damaged -- the data set should be recovered in some fashion.

))PDS873E TTR IS BEYOND THE USED PORTION OF THE DATA SET
   A TTR pointer in this member's directory has a value which exceeds
   the end of data marker for the data set.

   This type of error is unusual; it indicates that your data set
   contains one or more invalid TTR pointers and that the data set has
   been damaged -- the data set should be recovered in some fashion.

))PDS874E TSO COMMAND NAME IS INVALID
   TSO PARSE service indicates that this TSO command name was invalid.

   Valid TSO command names follow these rules:
     1.  The TSO command name should be from one to eight bytes long.
     2.  The first character of the TSO command name must be a
         alphabetic or national character.
     3.  Any additional characters should be alphabetic, numeric
         or national characters.

))PDS875E THIS DATA SET HAS NO DIRECTORY BLOCKS
   This is a null data set -- it contains no tracks and consequently,
   no directory blocks.

   When the data set takes an extent, it will receive actual disk
   tracks and directory blocks.

))PDS876E A DIRECTORY RECORD HAS AN INCORRECT LENGTH (NOT 256 BYTES)
   This data set has an invalid directory block.  Directory blocks
   should be 256 characters long and each block should contain an
   eight byte key.

   This type of error usually indicates that your data set has been
   written over and the data set should be recovered in some fashion.

))PDS877E INVALID SUBCOMMAND NAME
   TSO PARSE service indicates that this subcommand name was invalid.

   Valid subcommand names follow these rules:
     1.  The subcommand name should be from one to eight bytes long.
     2.  The first character of the subcommand name must be a
         alphabetic or national character.
     3.  Any additional characters should be alphabetic, numeric
         or national characters.

))PDS880E RESIDENCE MODE ANY AND ADDRESSING MODE xxx ARE INCOMPATIBLE
   Residence mode ANY and an addressing mode of either 24 or ANY are
   incompatible; this is an invalid combination of linkage editor
   attributes.

))PDS881E REENTRANT ATTRIBUTE CONFLICTS WITH NOT REUSABLE
   A reentrant attribute is incompatible with a not reusable attribute;
   this is an invalid combination of linkage editor attributes.

))PDS882E TEST ATTRIBUTE CONFLICTS WITH NOT EDIT
   A TEST attribute is incompatible with a NOT EDIT attribute;
   this is an invalid combination of linkage editor attributes.

))PDS883E REUSABLE ATTRIBUTE CONFLICTS WITH SCATTER
   A reusable attribute is incompatible with a scatter load attribute;
   this is an invalid combination of linkage editor attributes.

))PDS884E OVERLAY ATTRIBUTE CONFLICTS WITH xxx
   This message documents an incompatible combination of the overlay
   attribute and another linkage editor attribute as follows:
     1.  Overlay and reentrant are incompatible.
     2.  Overlay and reusable are incompatible.
     3.  Overlay and scatter load are incompatible.
     4.  Overlay and RMODE ANY are incompatible.
     5.  Overlay and AMODE 31 are incompatible.
     6.  Overlay and AMODE ANY are incompatible.

))PDS892E READ MULTIPLE FAILED
   PDS45678 has an input mode called "read multiple" which can read
   an entire track of disk data at a time.  A read multiple can fail
   for any of several reasons:
     I/O error    - an I/O error is on the current track
     invalid addr - the disk TTR address provided is invalid
     not capable  - the disk device can not perform a read multiple CCW

   After read multiple fails, PDS45678 uses its alternate double
   buffering input mode for the remainder of the subcommand.  With
   the next subcommand, read multiple is attempted again.

   If many subcommands issue failure messages for read multiple,
   consider changing the mode for input buffering to double with
   the following subcommand:
     CONTROL DOUBLE

))PDS910E TSO COMMAND name IS NOT ALLOWED
   You are not authorized to use this TSO command.  Contact your
   systems support staff if this restriction causes a problem.

))PDS920E SUBCOMMAND name IS NOT ALLOWED FOR THIS DATA SET
   You are not authorized to use this subcommand.  Contact your
   systems support staff if this restriction causes a problem.

))PDS930E name IS AN INVALID SUBCOMMAND ABBREVIATION
   This subcommand name is not allowed.  You must enter additional
   characters to create a valid subcommand name.

))PDS990E EXTENT INITIALIZATION READ FAILED
   The first read for an extent of this data set failed.  This type
   of problem is unusual unless your directory contains invalid TTR
   pointers.

))PDS991E PERMANENT I/O ERROR AT TTR=hexttr
   An uncorrectable I/O error was encountered at the displayed TTR
   address.

   This error may be due to data set or equipment errors.  A VERIFY
   subcommand may provide more information.

   Data set recovery will be required if this is a data set error.

))PDS998E ABEND Sxxx LOADING THIS MODULE
   The displayed ABEND code was received while loading this module.

   If you have your user profile set to WTPMSG as in the TSO command,
   PROFILE WTPMSG, you should have also first received an IEA703I
   message with the same ABEND code and a possible return code.

   In the following table of common messages, the ABEND identifier
   from the PDS998E message and the first part of the associated
   IEA703I message are listed with a short error description:
