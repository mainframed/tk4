   PDS provides entry assistance for several of its subcommands.  To use
   this facility, enter O to the right of%COMMAND ===>+on any panel
   which accepts PDS subcommands.  After the ENTER, the O command option
   panel will direct you as to which PDS subcommands are available.

   Shorthand notes:
    1.  You can bypass the O command option panel.  For example, enter
        O.VE as a command to enter the VERIFY assistance panel.  Note:
        the following example would skip both panels:  O.VE.memname stat
    2.  From the O command option panel, you can bypass the
        assistance panel.  For example, enter: ve.memname stats
        to format the subcommand:  Verify memname stats

   To get explanations of PDS subcommands, you need to reference the PDS
   HELP data set.  Enter O.HE from the%COMMAND ===>+line on an ISPMODE
   or MEMLIST panel to use the HELP subcommand assistance panel.
