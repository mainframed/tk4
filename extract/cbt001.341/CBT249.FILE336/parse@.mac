0     The TSU System  Aids completely replaces the  IKJPARS service rout

      TMP (as well as a number of undocumented ones).

0     One  improvement which  has  been found  to  be a  problem  for a
      commands is as follows:  IKJPARS permits an operand to be defined
      range (e.g.,   the subfield of the  COL keyword of the  LIST comma
      The standard  IKJPARS calls the validity  check exit once for  suc
      item,  regardless of  whether it is a  single item or a  range.
      means that if either element of a range is invalid,  the terminal
      is forced to reenter both parts.    The TSU IKJPARS calls the vali
      check exit three times for a range,  once for each part,  and once
      the entire  range,  allowing the  exit to reject  only that part
      range which is invalid.  This can cause problems if different crit
      apply to  the two parts  of a range.   Also,   if the exit  counts
      number of  times it is  called to determine the  number of items
      list,  the results  will be incorrect.   This procedure  is not ap
      priate even when the IBM IKJPARS is  used,  since it will also com
      an incorrect number  of elements for a  list which is a  subfield
      keyword which appears twice on the command line.
0     The TSU version of IKJPARS provides  a major new function which al
      a caller to define  new types of operands.   To use  this facility
      command with  one or more  operands with  unusual syntax can  take
      following steps:
0        ø Use the TSU  IKJEXTEN macro to describe each  such operand.
           macro will  include the address  of a caller-supplied  routin
           recognize and validate the operand.
0        ø Write a recognizer routine for  each special operand type (an
           gous  to  writing  a  PL/I   recognizer  routine  using  the
           Programmer Aids).   This routine can inspect an input value,
           determine whether the value is  correct or incorrect,  or whe
           the operand is missing;  if a valid value is present,  the re
           nizer should also store information about  the parameter in a
           (passed by  IKJPARS)  to  be used  by the  calling command  a
           parsing is complete.    Note that IKJPARS handles  the issuin
           any required diagnostic messages or prompts,  but that the re
           nizer may supply a second-level message to be associated with
           standard IKJPARS "invalid operand" message.

0     A recognizer routine is called from IKJPARS using standard IBM lin
      conventions,  with a pointer to a  parameter list in register 1.
      parameter list consists of seven fullwords, defined as follows:
0          Word 1 -  Addresses the  eight-byte PDE  in which  data is  t
                returned for a correct input parameter.   By convention,
                first four bytes contain the address of the parameter va
                the next two contain the parameter length,  and the last
                contain flags.   However,  the PDE may be used by the re
                nizer in any other manner desired,   save that bit 1 (X'
                of the seventh byte of the PDE must be turned on if a pa
                eter has been recognized.  The PDE is zeroed before entr
                a recognizer.
0          Word 2 - Contains the "user  work area" pointer originally pa
                to IKJPARS in word 7 of the PPL.
0          Word 3 - A word which may be  changed to address an error mes
                to be used  as a second-level message  to IKJPARS's stan
                "invalid parameter" message.   The message should be def
                in standard PUTLINE format.
0          Word 4  -  Addresses a  buffer  which  includes  the text  to
                processed by the recognizer.  This buffer is not necessa
                the original command  buffer.   The first two  bytes con
                the buffer length and the next  two bytes contain the of
                of the text to be analyzed,  starting from the fifth byt
                the buffer.   If the addressed text is accepted, or reje
                as invalid for the parameter,  the offset in the buffer
                be  updated  to address  the  point  after the  accepted
                rejected  value.   If  the  parameter  is to  be  consid
                missing (e.g.,  if the first character of the value is i
                propriate), the offset should not be changed.   Note tha
                is  permissible to  translate text  in the  buffer to  u
                case, but that other modifications should be avoided.
0          Word 5 - Addresses  the string specified by  the programmer u
                the PARM keyword of the IKJEXTEN macro.  The first two b
                contain the number of characters in the string.

                macro,  this word points to  an uppercase translation ta
                If ASIS was specified, this word contains zero.
0          Word 7 - Addresses  a routine to get storage  for return info

                by IKJPARS,   so that it will  be freed when  the progra
                issues IKJRLSA.   When the get routine is called, regist
                should contain  the number  of bytes  required;  on  ret
                register 1 will address the allocated storage.  Note tha
                storage  is unavailable  when  the  get routine  is  cal
                IKJPARS will terminate with return code 16 without retur
                to the recognizer.   Also note that this routine ignores
                contents of register 13,  so it is not necessary to defi
                new save area before a call.
0          After determining whether the input  parameter value is valid
           recognizer should  return to IKJPARS,   passing a return  cod
           register 15.  Valid return codes are as follows:

                and possibly translated the parameter value to upper cas

+           4:
                parameter value should be regarded as missing.  This cod

                nor the text buffer should be changed.
0           8:  Indicates that the text was  not recognized,  and that P

0     Example  1.2:   The  following is  a complete  recognizer designed
           recognize a compiler space parameter,  that is,  an item with
           syntax [-]n...[K].   The  PARM passed from the  IKJEXTEN macr
           assumed to  be a  single character giving  the maximum  numbe
           digits allowed (8 if omitted).  If the input value does not b
           with a minus sign or digit, the parameter is regarded as miss
           If recognition is successful,  the  returned PDE will contain
           following:
0               Bytes 0-3:   The address of a  string of digits (without
                     or minus sign).   If the  original input contained
                     the K will be removed and replaced by 000.
                Bytes 4-5:  The length of the string addresses by bytes
                Byte 6:  A  flag byte.    The X'80'  bit indicates  that
                     parameter was present, and the X'40' bit indicates
                     a minus sign was present.œ

-     œ This is not a good design for  this recognizer.   It would be be
        to have another bit defined to mean  "K present",  or to convert
        entire  value to  binary  and  store that  in  place  of the  st
        address.   The above design was chosen  to allow illustration of
        use of the IKJPARS get routine.
