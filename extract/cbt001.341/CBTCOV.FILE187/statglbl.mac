* STATDIE PARAMETERS:                                               YCC
*                                                                   YCC
* THE FOLLOWING SECTION COLLECTS NUMERIC VALUES WHICH THE           YCC
* AUTHOR REGARDS AS MOST LIKELY SUBJECT TO LOCAL MODIFICATION.      YCC
* THIS IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A TRUE SYSTEM GENERATION OPTION,       YCC
* BECAUSE THE VALUES CHOSEN BELOW ARE FAIRLY GENEROUS AND           YCC
* SHOULD SERVICE MOST USERS AS IS. AS FEEDBACK DEVELOPS             YCC
* ON THIS RELEASE, NEW OPTIONS MAY BE ADDED HERE LATER.             YCC
*                                                                   YCC
* PGBFCT    THIS IS THE NUBER OF PAGABLE BUFFERS TO BE ALLOCATED    YCC
*           IN CSA. THIS IS THE RETENTION PERIOD OF THE INCORE      YCC
*           AREA. IF THE SRB IS BEING DISPATCHED EVERY 30           YCC
*           SECONDS THEN THE DEFAULT VALUE OF 40 MEANS THAT         YCC
*           THE LAST 20 MINUTES OF DATA WILL BE IN VIRTUAL          YCC
*           MEMORY AT ANY TIME. THE DELAY TIME OF OURMF MUST        YCC
*           BE SHORT ENOUGH SO THAT THE BUFFERS ARE NOT             YCC
*           REUSED BETWEEN SWAPS. THE DEFAULT SWAP TIME OF          YCC
*           OURMF IS 15 MINUTES, WHICH LEAVES LOTS OF ROOM          YCC
*           ALSO, THE CPU COMMAND DISPLAYS THE WHOLE INCORE         YCC
*           AREA, SO SELECTION OF THIS PARAMETER EFFECTS THE        YCC
*           PERIOD OVER WHICH CPU WILL AVERAGE FOR ITS REPORT.      YCC
* SRBINTVL  THIS IS THE NUMBER OF SAMPLES WHICH ARE TAKEN           YCC
*           BEFORE THE INCORE BUFFER IS COPIED TO ONE OF THE        YCC
*           PAGABLE BUFFERS. EVERY SRBINTVL*MILLISC                 YCC
*           MILLISECONDS THE SRB IS SCHEDULED. THIS ALSO            YCC
*           EFFECTS THE SAMPLE PERIOD FOR RCT AND DOMAIN            YCC
*           INFORMATION. THE DEFAULT VALUE OF 120 SETS THIS         YCC
*           PERIOD TO EVERY 30 SECONDS.                             YCC
* MILLISC  THIS IS THE NUMBER OF MILLISECONDS BETWEEN               YCC
*           TIMER POPS AND SETS THE PSW SAMPLING FREQUENCY.         YCC
* MAXDMN    THIS IS THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF DOMAINS TO BE             YCC
