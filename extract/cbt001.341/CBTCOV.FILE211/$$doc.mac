0             1.  INFOCAT and INFOSMP
+                 _______ ___ _______
0                 These two PL/I  programs may be used  to create an
                  INFO/SYS -searchable data base  from the output of
                  IDCAMS "LISTCAT  ALL" and HMASMP "LIST  CDS XREF",
                  respectively.  Members SAMPCAT and SAMPSMP contain
                  sample output from searches  done against our data
                  base created by these  two programs;  the commands
                  used were  "KWS SYS1.VTAMLST" and  "KWS HASPPRPU".
                  An ISPF/PDF dialog to  search the regular INFO/MVS
                  data bases,  the CBT mods tape data base,  and the
                  data base created by these programs,  is also pro-
                  vided.
0             2.  VMDUMP
+                 ______
0                 This is a program which may  be used to transmit a
                  sequential MVS data  set to a VM/CMS  user in DISK
                  DUMP format.  The data is sent via the JES2 spool,
                  across an NJE  link,  to RSCS Networking,   to the
                  VM/CMS user's  virtual card  reader.   The  VM/CMS
                  user may  load the data onto  his A disk  by using
                  the  RECEIVE,  DISK  LOAD,   or RDRLIST  commands.
                  (This  is  a  one-way,   poor  man's  TSO/E  TRAN-
                  SMIT/RECEIVE  facility).    I   have  included  an
                  ISPF/PDF dialog  to generate  the required  JCL to
                  transmit the data,  although  ISPF is not required
                  to use  this program (you  could use  straight JCL
                  using member SVUTL13 as a guide).
0             3.  VUTL16
+                 ______
0                 This is an  ISPF/PDF dialog to display  MVS SP 1.3
                  GRS/ENQ information.  It will display current con-
                  tention if no  entries are made on  the processing
                  panel,  else it will  display whatever combination
                  of JOBNAME, MAJOR, and/or MINOR QCB information is
                  requested.

                program reads  the output  from IDCAMS  LISTCAT com-
                mands and creates input for INFO/SYS program BLGOZB.

                data to a  VM/CMS user.   This member  generates JCL
                with the  proper JECL cards to  put the data  on the
                queue so  that it will get  to the VM user  via RSCS
                Networking.   Similar  JCL could  be submitted  as a
                batch job independent of ISPF.

                VM/CMS DISK DUMP file on  DD name SYSUT2.   The data
                set is given a CMS file name based on the PARM field
                (if present), or the input data set name.  This pro-
