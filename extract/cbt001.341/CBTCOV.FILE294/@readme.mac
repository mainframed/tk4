This PDS has two compile jobs in it to set up the program Macros.
Macros is a Macro processor / source includer.  The first compile job is
in member ROUTINES and compiles two assembler and one PL/I routine to be
placed into a linklib.  The created linklib members are later included
by the compile step in PDS member MAIN.
In the JCL provided, this PDS is known as YV22505.F46.PDS.  You will
need to change this name to the name you use for the PDS.  In the
JCL provided, the target load library for both the linklib members and
the final load library is YV22505.TSO2.LOAD.  Note that you can
throw away the three linklib members (DDINFO, JFCB, and SVC99) after
Macros has been compiled.  You might want to keep these routines to
use in other applications.

Member DOC is a document in printer format for the Macros Program.
