//***FILE 294 is from Hans J. Becker of the Energy Information      *
//*           Administration, and contains a very useful program    *
//*           called MACROS.  This program allows complex           *
//*           searching, modification, and combination of pds       *
//*           members, to allow source and macro inclusion in       *
//*           another program.  Operation is controlled through     *
//*           parameter options and control statements.             *
//*                                                                 *
//*           This program was taken from File 46 of the SHARE      *
//*           PL/1 Tape.                                            *
//*                                                                 *
//*                          INTRODUCTION                           *
//*                                                                 *
//*           It seems that all of the ad hoc requests that I       *
//*      have written were sufficiently different that I could      *
//*      not simply reuse old ones.  Yet all seemed to have had     *
//*      some things in common.  It became clear that a mechanism   *
//*      was required that could pull bits and pieces from          *
//*      various sources together to satisfy a particular           *
//*      request.  This mechanism had to be very general and        *
//*      flexible in nature since it could potentially accomodate   *
//*      a number of different languages or program products.       *
//*                                                                 *
//*           Basically what was needed was a program that could    *
//*      dynamically include source code or data into a data set    *
//*      or job stream.  Furthermore, it was desirable to change    *
//*      this included code or place some conditions on it.         *
//*                                                                 *
//*           As it turned out, this program immediately showed     *
//*      promise in providing a very general tool with very broad   *
//*      applications.  Many features were suggested by Dick        *
//*      Heddinger, and I would like to express my appreciation.    *
//*                                                                 *
