SETCLOCK:  IST TOD CLOCK SYNCHRONIZER
-------------------------------------
ABSTRACT:
   THIS IS A PROGRAM WHOSE FUNCTION IS TO SYNCHRONIZE THE TIME-OF-DAY
CLOCKS ON ALL PROCESSORS IN A MULTI-CPU COMPLEX.  THE COMMUNICATIONS
VEHICLE IS A SHARED-DASD DATASET.  THE USE OF THIS PROGRAM PERMITS THE
SYNCHRONIZATION OF TOD CLOCKS OF CPU'S IN A COMPLEX TO WITHIN
MILLISECONDS OF EACH OTHER.  THE PROGRAM MUST BE APF-AUTHORIZED, SINCE
IT MUST ISSUE A MODESET TO GET INTO SUPERVISOR STATE TO ISSUE THE SCK
(SET CLOCK) INSTRUCTION.

   SETCLOCK SHOULD BE RUN IMMEDIATELY AFTER A COMPLEX-WIDE IPL IF SMF
DATA VALIDITY IS TO BE ENSURED.  THE TOD CLOCKS SHOULD BE SET NORMALLY
BEFORE STARTING SETCLOCK ON ALL PROCESSORS.  THE TOD CLOCK VALUE USED
FOR ALL PROCESSORS IS THE HIGHEST TOD CLOCK VALUE FOUND AMONG THE
PARTICIPATING PROCESSORS.

   THE SETCLOCK PACKAGE CONSISTS OF THREE MEMBERS:

SETCLOCK - ASSEMBLER SOURCE FOR THE SETCLOCK PROGRAM.  INSTALLATION
           CONSIDERATIONS ARE OUTLINED IN THE COMMENTS AT THE START
           OF THE PROGRAM.

SETCPROC - A SAMPLE SETCLOCK CATALOGUED PROCEDURE FOR STARTING THE
           SETCLOCK PROGRAM.

SETCPARM - A COPY OF OUR SETCLOCK PARAMETER DATASET, WHICH EXPLAINS AND
           ILLUSTRATES THE TOD CLOCK SYNCHRONIZATION PARAMETERS.
