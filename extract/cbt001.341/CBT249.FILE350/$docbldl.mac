IST BLDL/LINKLIST ANALYSIS PACKAGE
----------------------------------
ABSTRACT:
   THIS IS A PACKAGE WHICH ANALYZES BLDL ACTIVITY ON LINKLIST LIBRARIES,
BASED ON DATA TAKEN FROM A GTF TRACE OF SVC 18 (BLDL/FIND) ACTIVITY.  AS
OUTPUT, IT WILL GENERATE A RESIDENT BLDL LIST, AND A REPORT OF BLDL
ACTIVITY BY LINKLIST CONCATENATION LEVEL, WHICH CAN BE USED TO REORDER
THE LIBRARIES IN THE LINKLIST.
   BY SELECTING GTF DATA FROM A SINGLE SVC, IT IS POSSIBLE TO TRACE BLDL
ACTIVITY FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD (SUCH AS AN 8-HOUR SHIFT) WITH MINIMAL
OVERHEAD, WHILE PRODUCING AN OUTPUT FILE WHICH MAY REASONABLY BE
DIRECTED TO DISK.

   THE BLDL ANALYSIS PACKAGE CONSISTS OF THREE MEMBERS:

BLDLBLDR - ASSEMBLER SOURCE FOR THE PROGRAM WHICH GENERATES A RESIDENT
           BLDL LIST BASED ON A SORTED LIST OF PROGRAM NAMES AND USE
           COUNTS, AND DD STATEMENTS REFLECTING THE HOST SYSTEM'S
           LINKLIST CONFIGURATION.

BLDLJCL  - A SAMPLE JCL STREAM ILLUSTRATING THE USE OF THE SAS/ASSEMBLER
           PROGRAM COMBINATION FOR ANALYSIS OF THE ENTIRE LINKLIST
           CONFIGURATION, FOLLOWED BY A STAND-ALONE RUN OF THE BLDLBLDR
           PROGRAM TO CREATE A NEW RESIDENT BLDL LIST BASED ON A SUBSET
           OF THE LINKLIST LIBRARY CONCATENATION.

BLDLSAS  - A SAS PROGRAM WHICH ANALYZES GTF TRACE RECORDS OF SVC 18
           (BLDL/FIND) ACTIVITY, INVOKES BLDLBLDR TO DETERMINE THE
           LOCATION OF MODULES FOUND TO BE CANDIDATES FOR PLACEMENT IN
           A RESIDENT BLDL LIST, AND PRODUCES REPORTS OF BLDL USAGE BY
           MODULE NAME AND LIBRARY, AND BY LIBRARY.
