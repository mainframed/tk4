BELOW IS A LIST OF MODS MADE TO QUEUE AT BFGOODRICH. MOST OF THE MODS
ARE SIGNIFIED BY THE LETTERS BFG IN COLUMNS 69-71. THERE ARE PROBABLY
OTHER MODS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE AND FORGOT ABOUT.

  1. ADDED THE $ COMMAND TO ENTER JES2 COMMANDS
  2. ADDED THE XC COMMAND TO SCAN THE INCORE WQE'S
  3. REPLACED BSAM WITH EXCP AS ACCESS METHOD TO JES2 CKPT. MAKES Q
     RUN NOTICABLY FASTER.
  4. ADDED THE RM COMMAND TO INVOKE RMF
  5. ADDED EXECUTING JOB CLASS TO THE XI COMMAND
  6. MODIFIED FIND COMMAND TO NOT REQUIRE DELIMITERS
  7. ADDED THE CPU % AND DEMAND PAGING RATE TO THE UPPER LEFT HAND
     CORNER OF THE DISPLAY.
  8. AUTOMATICALLY AUTHORIZE CERTAIN USERS BY THERE LOGON ID.
  9. DISABLED THE XP COMMAND.
 10. ENABLE MESSAGES TO INTERRUPT THE SCREEN SO THEY ARE NOTICABLE.
 11. CHANGE SLOG COMMAND TO ACCEPT SYSTEM SMF ID NAMES. EX: SLOG IPO1
     (THIS WILL NEED TO BE TAILORED TO YOUR SYSTEM AS THE NAMES ARE
      HARDCODED)

NOTE: THE XC COMMAND NEEDS TO GET INTO KEY 0, SUPERVISOR STATE. IT USES
      A LOCAL SVC TO DO THAT. YOU WILL NEED TO MODIFY THE CODE TO FIX
      IT FOR YOUR LOCAL INSTALLATION.
