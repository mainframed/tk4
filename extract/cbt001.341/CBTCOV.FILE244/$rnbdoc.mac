THIS DATASET WAS OBTAINED FROM FILE 322 ON VER193 OF THE CBT TAPE, AND
WAS THEN MODIFIED AT RAINIER NATIONAL BANK.

RNB01 - Q1  (QUEUE)    - FIX TO FINAL TPUT MESSAGE TO ALLOW TO WORK WITH
                           BOTH TCAM AND VTAM
RNB02 - Q10 (INIT)     - REMOVE PART OF UF010: DON'T USE OPER AUTHORITY
                           TO SET QXAUTH. ALSO UF024: DON'T USE DBC.
RNB03 - Q10 (INIT)     - FOR RACF: IF &QRACF = 1, AND IF &QNEWUSR ISN'T
                           NULL, THEN IF APF-AUTHORIZED CHANGE THE
                           USERID IN THE ACEE SO THE USER CAN ACCESS A
                           RACF-PROTECTED SPOOL/CHECKPOINT DATA SET.
      - Q16 (PARSE)    - IF &QRACF = 1 THEN USE RACF TO CHECK AUTHORITY
                           TO USE THE XP COMMAND.
      - Q17 (READSPC)  - IF &QRACF = 1 THEN WHEN A JCT IS READ FROM THE
                           SPOOL BLANK THE PASSWORD AND NEWPASSWORD.
      - Q22 (XDS)      - IF &QRACF = 1 THEN DO A SPECIAL CHECK TO SEE IF
                           THE USER IF ALLOWED TO DO THE XDS COMMAND.
RNB04 - Q12 (JLOG)     - FIX TO ALLOW JLOG TO WORK FOR JOBS THAT ARE IN
                           EXECUTION BUT THAT HAVEN'T FINISHED THE FIRST
                           STEP. THIS WILL SHOW ONLY THE 'JOB STARTED'
                           MESSAGE.
RNB05 - Q14 (LIST)     - IF &QRNB = 1 THEN DO THE FOLLOWING:
                           (1) REMOVE THE PART OF UF005 THAT ALLOWS L TO
                               PROCESS DSID'S < 101 AND THAT ALLOWS AUTH
                               USERS TO LIST ANY JOB.  THIS REQUIRES THE
                               XD COMMAND TO BE USED TO LIST STRANGE
                               THINGS.
                           (2) ALLOW TSO USERS TO ACCESS ANY JOB THAT
                               STARTS WITH THEIR USERID OR THAT HAS A
                               NOTIFY FOR THEIR USERID. THIS WILL NOT
                               BE ALLOWED FOR USERID'S STARTING WITH
                               'PJS' DUE TO LOCAL RESTRICTIONS.
                           (3) ALLOW TSO USERS WHOSE USERID'S START WITH
                               'TEC' TO PROCESS ANY 'TEC...' JOB OR ANY
                               JOB WITH A NOTIFY FOR A TEC USER. ALSO
                               ALLOW THEM TO PROCESS OUTPUT FROM STARTED
                               TASKS.
RNB06 - Q16 (PARSE)    - ADDED THE FOLLOWING COMMAND ABBREVIATIONS FOR
                           CONSISTENCY WITH PREVIOUS VERSIONS:
                                 JC  FOR JCL
                                 JL  FOR JLOG
                                 JM  FOR JMSG
                                 SL  FOR SLOG
                                 FT  FOR FTIM
                                 DE  FOR DEL
                                 RE  FOR REQ
                         ALSO, IF &QRNB = 1, DELETE COMMANDS TSO, EXEC,
                           AND MODEL.
RNB07 - Q24 (ACTIVE)   - WHEN LISTING BATCH JOBS SAY THEY
                           ARE ON THE XEQ QUEUE INSTEAD OF THE INPUT
                           QUEUE TO BE MORE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE
                           OPERATORS USUALLY SEE.
RNB08 - Q26 (SYSOUT)   - IF &QRNB = 1, ALLOW USERS TO MANIPULATE JOBS
                           THAT START WITH THEIR USERID'S OR THAT HAVE
                           A NOTIFY FOR THEIR USERID, UNLESS THE USERID
                           STARTS WITH 'PJS'.
                         IF &QRNB = 1, ALLOW 'TEC' USERS TO MANIPULATE
                           ANY TEC JOB OR STARTED TASK OUTPUT.
RNB09 - Q26 (SYSOUT)   - IF &QRNB = 1, FOR A REQ OPERATION, IF A NEW
                           CLASS IS NOT GIVEN, USE CLASS C AS THE
                           DEFAULT NEW CLASS.
RNB10 - Q27 (PRINT)    - IF &QRNB = 1, USE C AS THE DEFAULT SYSOUT
                           CLASS.
RNB11 - Q4  (DDNAME)   - ALLOW DDNAME COMMAND TO BE
                           ISSUED AS   DDNAME JOBID S
                           WHERE THE S INDICATES THAT THE SPIN DATA
                           SETS SHOULD ALSO BE LISTED. THIS WAS ADDED
                           BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME LONG RUNNING BATCH JOBS
                           (IMS) THAT SPIN THINGS AND THE STANDARD Q
                           COMMAND DOESN'T SEARCH THE SPIN Q FOR BATCH
                           JOBS.
RNB12 - Q4  (DDNAME)   - IF &QSP = 1, DON'T FORMAT THE MESSAGE 'ALREADY
                           PRINTED', AS IT APPEARS THAT THE FLAG BIT
                           IN THE PDDB IS NOT USED ANY MORE, CAUSING
                           ALL SPIN DATA SETS TO APPEAR PRINTED, EVEN
                           WHEN THEY'RE NOT.
RNB13 - Q5  (DISPLAY)  - FIX SOME PROBLEMS WITH TCAM
                           AND THE PROCESSING OF THE TEST-REQUEST,
                           SYSTEM-REQUEST, AND THE PA2/PA3 KEYS.
RNB14 - Q5  (DISPLAY)  - BUG FIX FOR FULL-SCREEN PROCESSING. WITH THIS
                           FIX THE USER CAN ENTER A COMMAND IN EITHER
                           INPUT FIELD, NOT JUST THE BOTTOM ONE.
RNB15 - Q5  (DISPLAY)  - RESTORE THE PFK DEFINITIONS FOR
                           PF7/8 TO '- 27' AND '+ 27' AS ORIGINALLY
                           SUPPLIED BY THE ICBC MOD. WE DON'T HAVE
                           THE OTHER 3278 MODELS, AND SCROLLING IS
                           EASIER THIS WAY. WITH NERDC'S CHANGES TO
                           MAKE THE KEYS 'PB' AND 'PF' IT IS DIFFICULT
                           TO SCROLL UP OR DOWN A FEW LINES.
RNB16 - Q20 (SEARCH)   - PROCESS BOTH THE LOCAL AND REMOTE QUEUES FOR
                           JOBS AWAITING PRINT/PUNCH.
                         ALSO FIX A BUG IN UF020 THAT WAS CLEARING THE
                           JOEFLAG  WHEN JUST THE JOEJQE POINTER SHOULD
                           BE CLEARED.
RNB17 - Q7  (FORMAT)   - WHEN FORMATTING JOES:
                           (1) IF THE JOE IS BEING PROCESSED BY PSO,
                               INDICATE EXT-WTR FOR A DEVICE TYPE.
                           (2) USE $JOEBUSY FLAG TO INDICATE WHETHER JOB
                               IS REALLY PRINTING/PUNCHING. OTHERWISE,
                               AN INTERRUPTED JOB STILL SHOWS AS ON THE
                               PRINTER/PUNCH.
                           (3) FOR SP2, FIX A BUG IN GETTING TO THE
                               CHECKPOINT JOE AND IN COMPUTING THE LINES
                               LEFT TO PRINT/PUNCH.
                           (4) FOR SP2, IF THE JOE IS NOT ACTIVE, BUT
                               THE CHECKPOINT JOE IS VALID, SHOW THE
                               LINES LEFT, NOT THE ORIGINAL LINE COUNT.
RNB18 - Q7  (FORMAT)   - DISTINGUISH BETWEEN JOES WITH REMOTE ROUTING
                           AND THOSE WITH SPECIAL LOCAL ROUTING (DESTID
                           INITIALIZATION STATEMENT IN JES PARMS).
RNB19 - Q20 (SEARCH)   - FOR STATUS OR DJ COMMANDS IN THE SP2 VERSION,
                           ALSO SEARCH THE DUMP Q, THE CONVERSION Q,
                           AND THE OUTPUT Q. THIS ALLOWS THE USER TO
                           FIND HIS JOB IF IT'S AWAITING DUMP, AWAITING
                           CONVERSION, OR AWAITING OUTPUT PROCESSING.
      - Q7  (FORMAT)   - WHEN LISTING JQE'S, DON'T ASSUME INPUT QUEUE
                           BUT USE JQETYPE INSTEAD. ALSO, SPECIAL
                           HANDLING FOR AWAITING CONVERSION, AWAITING
                           DUMP, AND AWAITING OUTPUT.
RNB20 - Q7  (FORMAT)   - DISTINGUISH BETWEEN NORMAL HOLD, HELD VIA $HA,
                           AND DUPLICATE HOLD. ALSO, FOR JOES, IF THE
                           SELECT=NO FLAG IS ON, FLAG WITH S=N TO SHOW
                           WHY THE OUTPUT WON'T PRINT.
RNB21 - Q7  (FORMAT)   - FIX THE SETDEVIC ROUTINE FOR SP2 SO THE PROPER
                           DEVICE NAMES SHOW UP FOR JOBS ON PRINTERS,
                           ETC.
RNB22 - Q6  (FINDJOB)  - IF JOBNAME = *, AFTER READING THE JCT, ENSURE
                           THAT JQEJNAME = JCTJNAME AND THAT QPJOBID =
                           JCTJBKEY IN CASE THE JOB HAS PURGED AND THE
                           JCT HAS BEEN REUSED SINCE WE LAST READ THE
                           CHECKPOINT. THIS IS UNLIKELY, BUT SEEMS TO BE
                           POSSIBLE.
RNB23 - Q8  (HELP)     - MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES TO THE NERDC HELP INFO.
                           THE ORIGINAL NERDC VERSION IS MEMBER $Q8, AND
                           THE OLD RNB MEMBER IS #Q8.
RNB24 - Q23 (INITS)    - BUG FIX, AS SUGGESTED BY JACK SHUDEL
RNB25 - Q7  (FORMAT)   - ADD 'COUNT' OPTION TO THE HO COMMAND TO HELP
                           FIND WHICH JOBS ARE TIEING UP SPOOL SPACE.
                           WHEN THE COUNT OPTION IS USED, THE JCT FOR
                           EACH JQE WITH HELD OUTPUT WILL BE READ AND
                           THE JCT TOTAL LINE COUNT WILL BE DISPLAYED.
RNB26 - Q24 (ACTIVE)   - BUG FIX (SORT OF): THE DC COMMAND WAS SHOWING
                           A LOT OF STRANGE JOBS. THIS FIX MAKES IT MORE
                           REASONABLE, BUT IT'S STILL NOT QUITE RIGHT.
                           ALL OF THE STARTED TASKS, E.G. TCAM, DON'T
                           SHOW UP.

========================================================================
KNOWN PROBLEMS:
  (1) DC S DOESN'T SHOW ALL OF THE STARTED TASKS.
  (2) JOE PRIORITIES ARE (PROBABLY) INCORRECT, AS THE CALCULATIONS
      CHANGED FOR SP2 AND Q HASN'T BEEN UPDATED TO REFLECT THAT.
  (3) IT APPEARS THAT THE LINE COUNTS FOR JOBS ON A REMOTE PRINTER ARE
      MAINTAINED DIFFERENTLY THAT FOR JOBS ON A LOCAL PRINTER. THIS HAS
      NOT BEEN FULLY RESEARCHED YET, BUT IT SEEMS THAT THE LINE COUNT
      REPORTED BY Q FOR A JOB ON A REMOTE PRINTER IS APPROXIMATELY THE
      NUMBER OF LINES PRINTED, NOT THE NUMBER THAT REMAIN TO BE PRINTED.
  (4) ONLY 2 (POSSIBLY 3) CHARACTER REMOTE NUMBERS CAN BE USED.
  (5) NJE NODE NUMBERS ARE IGNORED.
  (6) THE NJE JOB/SYSOUT TRANSMITTERS AND RECEIVERS ARE IGNORED AS
      DEVICES AND AS QUEUES.
