            THIS IS A FILE OF THE JCL PROCEDURES FOR USE WITH 3 OTHER
           FILES I HAVE DONATED. BEING AN OS/MVT PERSON (WHEN THINGS
           WERE FREE) I SAVED THE 360 VERSION OF FORTRAN-G AND PL1-F.
           THEN ALONG WITH FORTRAN G IS THE GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER
           VERSION OF FORTRAN-H (THIS IS NOT FORTRAN-H-EXTENDED). THIS
           IS ALL FREE SOFTWARE AND WORKS FINE IN THE MVS WORLD. I HAVE
           BEEN TOLD THAT PL1F DOESN'T FUNCTION IN THE MVS-XA WORLD
           (IF YOU CAN AFFORD MVS-XA, YOU COULD BUY EVERYTHING). ALSO
           I EXTRACTED RPG FROM THE FINAL RELEASE OF OS/MVT AND PUT
           IT INTO A FILE.

           THE 3 FILES ARE BUILT AS FOLLOWS:

           PL1FLOAD - THIS CONTAINS THE COMPILER AND LIBRARY FOR PL1F.
                      IT HAS BEEN TOLD TO ME THAT MAYBE THIS WILL
                      WORK IN MVS/XA. BUT IT PREMISES YOU HAVE NO
                      ERRORS IN THE CODE AT EXECUTION TIME. TRY IT.

                      5 AUG 88 - IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT PL1F WORKS
                      FINE IN MVS/XA 2.2.0; THIS IS PREDICATED ON YOU
                      RE-LINKING THE ENTIRE LIBRARY (LOOK TO THE
                      PDS TSO COMMAND) LEAVING OFF THE "DC" OPTION.
                      WILL BE ADDING THE JCL STREAM TO CREATE THE
                      XA LIBRARY IN THE FUTURE. GOT THE STREAM FROM
                      SAM GOLOB OF NEWSWEEK.


           FORTLOAD - THIS CONTAINS THE COMPILERS FOR FORTRAN G & H.
                      ALSO THERE IS THE FORTRAN LIBRARY FOR BOTH OF
                      THEM (SYS1.FORTLIB).

                      REGULAR FORTRAN HAS THE 'STAE' ROUTINE CALLED
                      IHOSTAE. WELL GODDARD'S VERSION HAS GSFSTAE
                      WHICH MUST BE AVAILABLE AT RUNTIME. MY ADVICE
                      IS TO STEPLIB TO THE ENTIRE LIBRARY AT RUN
                      TIME.

                      SCOTT VETTERS (MICHIGAN MUTAL) SAYS THE FORTG
                      COMPILER IS RUNNING ON HIS MVS/XA 2.1.2 SYSTEM.
                      (313) 827-7400 EXT 336

                      I HAVE FORTG RUNNING ON MVS/XA 2.2.0 WITH NO
                      PROBLEMS.


           RPGLOAD  - THIS CONTAINS THE DLIB AND COMPILER LIBRARY FOR
                      THE OS/MVT VERSION OF RPG. THE JOB CALLED
                      'RPG$GEN' IS THE EXTRACTED LINKEDIT CARDS FROM
                      AN OS/MVT SYSGEN FOR LINKING ALL THE RPG
                      COMPILER MODULES (FOR YOU INFO). INCLUDED IS
                      A SAMPLE JOB TO TEST IT ( IT WORKS ON AN
                      MVS/SP1.3.3 AND MVS/XA.

            NOTES: YOU CAN FIND OUT ALL THE DEFAULTS BY EXECUTING
                   THE COMPILERS WITH A PARM=   AND LOOK AT WHAT
                   IS SET. HAVE FUN, SO NOW YOU HAVE NO EXCUSE TO
                   IGNORE SOME OF THE MORE INTERESTING (IF YOU KNOW
                   WHAT I MEAN) PROGRAMS ON THE MODS TAPES WRITTEN
                   IN PL1F OR FORTRAN!! (LOOK TO THE HEAVENS)
