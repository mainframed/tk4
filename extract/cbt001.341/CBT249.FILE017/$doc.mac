CONTENTS:

CDSLIST  - A MODIFIED VERSION OF THE CDSLIST PROGRAM, ORIGINALLY FROM
           FILE 132 OF THE CBT TAPE. MODIFIED FOR SYSPRINT LRECL OF
           150. ALSO, A CONTROL CARD IN SYSIN OF THE FORM FMID=XXXXXXX
           WILL RESTRICT THE LISTING TO THOSE ELEMENTS OWNED BY THE
           SPECIFIED FMID.

DISKMAPA - A PROGRAM TO ALLOCATE ALL ONLINE DASD VOLUMES AND THEN LINK
           TO THE DISK MAPPING PROGRAM DISKMAP (FROM CBT FILE 260).
           MUST BE LINKED AC=1. REQUIRES DYNAM FROM CBT FILE 89 OR THE
           SLIGHTLY MODIFIED VERSION FROM THIS FILE.

DYNAM    - A SLIGHTLY MODIFIED VERSION OF THE DYNAMIC ALLOCATION
           INTERFACE FROM CBT FILE 89. HANDLES MORE OF THE ALLOWABLE
           ALLOCATION KEYWORD UNITS THAN THE VERSION ON THE TAPE.

RGROUP   - FOR SHOPS THAT RUN RACF, ALLOWS THE USER TO SWITCH TO A
           DIFFERENT CONNECT GROUP WITHOUT HAVING TO LOGOFF AND LOG
           BACK ON SPECIFYING THE DIFFERENT GROUP ON THE LOGON COMMAND.
           BASICALLY, IT PERFORMS A RACINIT "CHANGE" FUNCTION. MUST BE
           LINKED AND EXECUTED AC=1. CAN BE RUN IN BATCH OR AS A TSO CP.

SPFCOPY  - A PROGRAM TO COPY A "CARD-IMAGE" DATASET OR PDS MEMBER INTO
           A PDS MEMBER WITH DISP=SHR. PRESERVES DATASET INTEGRITY BY
           USING AN SPF ENQUEUE/RESERVE TO LOCK OUT OTHER RUNNING
           SPFCOPY PROGRAMS OR TSO USERS WHILE THE COPY TAKES PLACE.

VTOC     - A TSO CP FOR LOOKING AT VTOCS AND OPTIONALLY SCRATCHING
           AND UNCATALOGING DATA SETS. CONTAINS SOME INSTALLATION
           SENSITIVE CODE, BUT SHOULD WORK WITHOUT MODIFICATION.
           THE VTOC COMMAND CAN INVOKE THE PDS COMMAND (VIA 'ALIAS'
           LPDS) OR THE RLSE COMMAND, BUT IT REQUIRES THE PCF X
           FACILITY TO DO SO
