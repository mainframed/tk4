*
*       QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS SHOULD BE DIRECTED TO THE AUTHOR AT THE
*       COMSAT ADDRESS.
*
*       THIS PROGRAM WAS MODIFIED TO ACCESS THE COMMAND TABLE BY
*       A VCON OR THE LOAD MACRO. THE MODS DONE BY
*          BILL REID, UNIV. OF MANITOBA
*
*        VARIETY OF MODS INCLUDING LIST SUPPORT BY GORD CORMACK, UMW
*
* mods to GPP 1979 FEB by r tilley UMW
* - script strings are no longer uppercased or otherwize molested
* - passwords on dsnames no longer ignored
* - unquoted dsns for existing datasets need not have valid suffix
* - omission of either leading or trailing quote on dsn
* - leading dot on dsn instead of quotes
* - trailing dot on dsn prevents addition of suffix only
* - qualifier TSO is used to create new names unless the user has
*   already entered an unquoted name ending with the valid suffix
* - additional options may be appended to a prompt reply
* - a prompter containing only 1 command may be renamed or aliased
* - SPACE,BLKSIZE for temporary datasets(SDL) taken from DAIRPB macro
* - * is accepted as a reply to a reenter dsn prompt.
* - quote following (MEMBER) no longer ignored
* - partial DSN:VOLSER support(will not create a new dataset if the
*   DSNAME is already in the catalog.)
*
*
*       GPPROMPT IS A GENERAL-PURPOSE, TABLE-DRIVEN, TSO COMMAND
*       PROMPTER. IT IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE A COMPARATIVELY EASY
*       METHOD OF ADDING NEW TSO COMMANDS THAT MEET CERTAIN
*       SPECIFICATIONS.
*
*       VALID COMMAND PROMPTERS  ARE THOSE WHICH ESSENTIALLY CONSIST
*       OF -
         SPACE
*        1) ALLOCATION OF DATASETS BASED ON OPERANDS IN THE COMMAND
*           STRING.
         SPACE
*        2) PASSING PARAMETERS TO A PROGRAM FROM EITHER THE COMMAND
*           STRING OR ELSE FROM A DEFAULT STRING.
         SPACE
*        3) CALLING A PROGRAM EITHER VIA XCTL (FOR THOSE IN LINKLIB)
*           OR ELSE VIA ATTACH FOR THOSE PROGRAMS IN A PRIVATE LIBRARY
         EJECT
* COMMANDS ARE OF THE FORM -
*
* COMMAND-NAME POS-OPTIONS,... KEY-OPTIONS,... PARMS,...
*
* COMMAND-NAME IS ANY VALID NAME ENTERED IN THE COMMAND TABLE
*       AND LINK-EDITED AS AN ALIAS TO GPPROMPT.
*
* POS-OPTIONS ARE POSITIONAL OPTIONS WHICH MUST FOLLOW THE COMMAND-
*       NAME IN A SPECIFIED ORDER. THESE ARE IDENTIFIED TO GPPROMPT BY
*       OMITTING THE 'NAME=' FIELD OF THE 'OPTION' MACRO. POSITIONAL
*       OPTIONS ARE PROBABLY DATASET NAMES; THESE FOLLOW NORMAL TSO
*       NAMING CONVENTIONS. A PROMPTING MESSAGE AND A HELP MESSAGE
*       MAY BE SPECIFIED IN THE 'PROMPT=' AND 'HELP=' FIELDS OF
*       OF THE OPTION MACRO. IN ADDITION, DEFAULT AND INSERT
*       STRINGS MAY ALSO BE SPECIFIED. THE USER WILL BE PROMPTED ONLY
*       IF HE OMITTED THE FIELD, NO DEFAULT STRING WAS INCLUDED
*       AND A PROMPT STRING WAS INCLUDED IN THE 'OPTION' MACRO.
*
* KEY-OPTIONS ARE VALID KEYWORDS KNOWN TO GPPROMPT VIA THE 'NAME='
*       FIELD OF THE 'OPTION' MACRO. KEY-OPTIONS ARE GENERALLY
*       USED FOR ALLOCATING DATASETS (E.G. 'PRINT(*)'). DEFAULTS
*       MAY BE SPECIFIED FOR EACH KEYWORD OPTION. A STRING MAY
*       BE SPECIFIED IN THE 'INSERT=' FIELD TO BE PROCESSED AS

*       INSERTION IS MADE ONLY IF THE OPTION WERE SPECIFIED, NOT
*       IF IT HAD BEEN TAKEN BY DEFAULT.
*
* PARMS ARE STRINGS WHICH ARE TO BE PASSED IN THE PARAMETER LIST
*       TO THE PROGRAM BEING EXECUTED. ANY STRING NOT RECOGNIZED AS
*       AN OPTION IS ASSUMED TO BE A PARM.
*
*       THE FOLLOWING DESCRIBES HOW TO SPECIFY EACH OF THE MACROS
