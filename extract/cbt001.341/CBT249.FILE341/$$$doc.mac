     NOTE ON THE CLISTS:
        MOST OF THE PROGRAMS USED IN THE CLISTS ARE EXECUTED VIA
        THE "$" COMMAND WHICH SIMPLY USES THE PROGRAM FROM THE LINKLIST.
        THIS COULD BE CHANGED TO "CALL 'LIBRARY(PROGRAM)'" IF YOU WISH
        ONE DISADVANTAGE OF THE "$" COMMAND AS IT IS IMPLEMENTED HERE
        IS THAT IT DOES NOT PASS A PARAMETER LIST TO THE PROGRAM.
