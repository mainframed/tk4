)F       THE # COMMAND CAN BE USED IN PLACE OF THE CALL COMMAND
         FOR PROGRAMS THAT ARE IN THE LINK LIST DATA SETS OR LPALIB;
         THIS INCLUDES ALL COMPILERS AND UTILITIES.


         ADVANTAGES OF THE # COMMAND OVER CALL COMMAND:
         1) THE # COMMAND REQUIRES NO DYNAMIC DD CARD NOR
            ALLOCATION AND IS, THEREFORE, CONSIDERABLY FASTER;
         2) THE # COMMAND SIMPLIFIES SYNTAX AND REQUIRES
            LESS TYPING;
         3) THE # COMMAND ALLOWS USE OF PROGRAMS IN ANY OF
            THE LINKLIB DATA SETS, WITHOUT KNOWING WHICH OF THE
            DATA SETS THE PROGRAM IS IN.
         4) THE # COMMAND SEARCHES THE LPA QUEUE BEFORE THE
            LINKLIST, SO IT CAN EXECUTE PROGRAMS IN THE LPA
            THAT ARE NOT ALSO IN THE LINKLIST.

         DISADVANTAGES OF THE # COMMAND:
         THE ONLY DISADVANTAGE OF THE # COMMAND IS THAT
         THE PROGRAM BEING CALLED MUST BE IN A LINKLIB DATA SET;
         HENCE, TO CALL A USER'S PROGRAM FROM HIS LIBRARY, THE
         CALL COMMAND MUST STILL BE USED.
)X       THE SYNTAX OF THE # COMMAND IS AS FOLLOWS:
         # PROGRAM 'PARM'
         WHERE PROGRAM IS THE NAME OF THE PROGRAM TO BE EXECUTED AND
         'PARM' IS AN OPTIONAL PARM FIELD OF UP TO 100 CHARACTERS
         WHICH IS TO BE PASSED TO THE PROGRAM.
)O       THE OPERANDS OF THE # COMMAND ARE:
         PROGRAM - THE 1 TO 8 CHARACTER NAME OF THE PROGRAM TO BE
                   EXECUTED.
         'PARM'  - THE OPTIONAL 0 TO 100 CHARACTER STRING, ENCLOSED IN
                   QUOTES, REPRESENTING THE PARAMETER TO BE PASSED TO
                   THE PROGRAM.

         EXAMPLE - INVOKING IEHLIST.  SYSPRINT AND SYSIN MUST BE
                   PREVIOUSLY ALLOCATED.

                   # IEHLIST

         EXAMPLE - INVOKING ASSEMBLER F WITH PARMS OF TEST AND RENT

                   # IEUASM 'TEST,RENT'
