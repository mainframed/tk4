)F FUNCTION
   THE WHATIF COMMAND IS INTENDED FOR USE IN COMMAND PROCEDURES.
   IT ALLOWS THE CONDITIONAL EXECUTION OF A TSO COMMAND BASED ON
   ANY COMBINATION OF THE FOLLOWING CRITERIA:

     1) WHETHER A FILE OR DATASET IS ALLOCATED.
     2) WHETHER A DATASET IS ALLOCATED TO A SPECIFIC FILE NAME.
     3) WHETHER A DATASET IS CATALOGED.
     4) WHETHER TWO STRINGS BEAR A SPECIFIED RELATION TO EACH OTHER.

     NOTE THAT ALL THE CONDITIONS SPECIFIED ON THE COMMAND MUST BE
     SATISFIED BEFORE THE COMMAND IN THE 'THEN' KEYWORD IS EXECUTED.

     IF THE 'THEN(COMMAND)' KEYWORD IS NOT SPECIFIED, THE RETURN CODE
     WILL BE SET TO INDICATE TRUE (0) OR FALSE (4).

     IF THE 'THEN(COMMAND)' KEYWORD IS SPECIFIED, THE RETURN CODE
     WILL BE SET BY THE EXECUTED COMMAND OR, IF THE COMMAND IS NOT
     EXECUTED, WILL BE SET TO THE VALUE &LASTCC HAD PRIOR TO WHATIF.

))THEN('COMMAND') - 'COMMAND' IS TSO COMMAND TO BE EXECUTED IF ALL
       TESTS SPECIFIED ARE SATISFIED.  IF YOU OMIT THIS KEYWORD
       ENTIRELY, THE WHATIF COMMAND WILL SET A RETURN CODE THAT YOUR
       CLIST CAN TEST AS FOLLOWS: IF &LASTCC EQ 0 THEN GOTO TRUELABL

))FILE('DDNAME') - THE DDNAME GIVEN AS THE ARGUMENT OF THIS KEYWORD
       MAY BE TESTED TO SEE IF IT IS ALLOCATED OR IF IT IS ALLOCATED TO
       A SPECIFIC DATASET. (SEE ALLOCATED/NALLOCATED).

))DATASET('DSNAME') - THE 'DSNAME' SPECIFIED MAY BE:
       1) TESTED TO SEE IF IT IS ALLOCATED.
       2) USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FILE KEYWORD TO SEE IF IT
          IS ALLOCATED TO THE SPECIFIED FILE NAME.
       3) TESTED TO SEE IF IT IS CATALOGED.
       SEE ALLOCATED/NALLOCATED AND CATALOGED/NCATALOGED FOR DETAILS.
       FULLY QUALIFIED DATA SET NAMES MUST BE IN QUOTES (').
       UNQUALIFIED DATA SET NAMES WILL BE PREFIXED IN THE NORMAL WAY.

))ALLOCATED - IF THIS KEYWORD IS SPECIFIED AND:
       1) THE FILE KEYWORD ONLY IS GIVEN: THE DDNAME SPECIFIED IS
          TESTED TO SEE IF IT IS ALLOCATED.
       2) THE DATASET KEYWORD ONLY IS GIVEN: THE DSNAME SPECIFIED IS
          TESTED TO SEE IF IT IS ALLOCATED.
       3) BOTH THE FILE AND DATASET KEYWORDS ARE GIVEN: THE DSNAME IS
          TESTED TO SEE IF IT IS ALLOCATED TO THE SPECIFIED DDNAME.

))NALLOCATED - THIS IS THE NOT FORM OF THE ALLOCATED KEYWORD.
       SEE ALLOCATED FOR DETAILS OF THE TESTS PERFORMED.

))CATALOGED - IF THIS KEYWORD IS SPECIFIED DSNAME GIVEN AS THE ARGUMENT
       OF THE DATASET KEYWORD IS TESTED TO SEE IF IT IS CATALOGED.

))NCATALOGED - THIS IS THE NOT FORM OF THE CATALOGED KEYWORD.
       SEE CATALOGED FOR DETAILS OF THE TESTS PERFORMED.

))PSTRING('STRING1') - THE FIRST OF A PAIR OF QUOTED STRINGS WHICH ARE
       TO BE COMPARED ACCORDING TO A SPECIFIED RELATION.

))QSTRING('STRING2') - THE SECOND OF A PAIR OF QUOTED STRINGS WHICH ARE
       TO BE COMPARED ACCORDING TO A SPECIFIED RELATION.

))EQ - IF THIS KEYWORD IS SPECIFIED THE ARGUMENTS OF PSTRING AND
       QSTRING ARE TESTED FOR EQUALITY.

))NE - IF SPECIFIED INDICATES THAT PSTRING SHOULD BE COMPARED TO
       QSTRING FOR INEQUALITY.

))GT - IF SPECIFIED INDICATES THAT PSTRING SHOULD BE COMPARED TO
       QSTRING FOR GREATER THAN.

))NG - IF SPECIFIED INDICATES THAT PSTRING SHOULD BE COMPARED TO
       QSTRING FOR NOT GREATER THAN.

))LT - IF SPECIFIED INDICATES THAT PSTRING SHOULD BE COMPARED TO
       QSTRING FOR LESS THAN.

))NL - IF SPECIFIED INDICATES THAT PSTRING SHOULD BE COMPARED TO
       QSTRING FOR NOT LESS THAN.

))GE - IF SPECIFIED INDICATES THAT PSTRING SHOULD BE COMPARED TO
       QSTRING FOR GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO.

))LE - IF SPECIFIED INDICATES THAT PSTRING SHOULD BE COMPARED TO
       QSTRING FOR LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO.
