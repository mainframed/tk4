)F FUNCTION -
The SCHEDULE command displays and alters the automatic operator
commands schedule. (These are the operator commands that are issued
automatically by the system at particular dates and times).

)X SYNTAX -
SCHEDULE "a subcommand and its operands"

Alias    - SCHED

Required - none.

Default  - If no operands are given, then subcommands are prompted
           for.

Notes    - If operands are given, then they are processed as a
           subcommand. In this case when the subcommand is finished,
           the SCHEDULE command processor ends without prompting for
           more subcommands.

)O OPERANDS -
Operands are optional. If given, then they are processed as a
subcommand. The following are subcommands of the SCHEDULE command
processor.

))SCHEDULE - Adds entries to the automatic operator commands schedule.
))DISPLAY  - Displays entries in the automatic operator commands
             schedule.
))CHANGE   - Changes existing entries in the automatic operator
             commands schedule. Also can be used to create new entries
             that are similar to existing entries.
))DELETE   - Removes entries from the automatic operator commands
             schedule.
))END      - Terminates the SCHEDULE command processor.
))HELP     - Displays complete subcommand usage information.

)S SUBCOMMANDS - SCHEDULE, DISPLAY, CHANGE, DELETE, END, and HELP.

=SCHEDULE=S
)F FUNCTION -
The SCHEDULE subcommand adds an entry to the automatic operator
commands schedule.

)X SYNTAX -
SCHEDULE 'operator command' SYSID(system id) DATE(mm/dd/yy) TIME(hh:mm)
         NAME(application name) WEEKDAY(day name) WINDOW(hh:mm)
         [NOT]IPLFORCED [NO]OVERRIDE

Alias    - The minimum abreviation is S.

Required - 'operator command', DATE, TIME, and NAME.

Defaults - SYSID(CRNT) WEEKDAY(ANY) WINDOW("until midnight")
           NOTIPLFORCED NOOVERRIDE.

)O OPERANDS -

))'OPERATOR COMMAND' - This is required. It gives the operator command
that is to be automatically scheduled. The command may be any command
that can be issued from an operator's console. The command must be
enclosed within single quotes ('). Imbedded quotes must be represented
by pairs of quotes; i.e., a ' appearing within the command must be
represented by '' (not ").

))SYSID(system id) - For multi-system configurations, this operand
specifies on which computer this scheduled command is permitted to be
executed. "System id" must be the "SMF-id" of the desired computer.
System ids consist of from one to four alphameric characters.

"SYSID(CRNT)" means the "current computer" - i.e., the computer which
you are currently logged on to. This is the default.

"SYSID(ANY)" means "any computer". The scheduled command may be
executed by any computer in the configuration - which ever one gets
around to it first.

))SYSTEM(system id) - This is an alias for SYSID.

))DATE(mm/dd/yy) - This is required. It gives the date or dates on
which the operator command is to be executed.

mm, dd, and/or yy may each be given as a dash (-). This is a "wild
card" character that causes that field to match any value. For example,
a dash given for mm means "any month".

If yy is equal to or less than 50, then the 21st century is assumed.

When - is given for mm, then a value of 31 given for dd means "the
last day of the month" - even those months that are shorter than 31
days.

Examples:      DATE(2/9/80)        means February 2, 1980.
               DATE(2/8/40)        means February 2, 2040.
               DATE(-/31/81)       means The last day of every month in
                                         1981.
               DATE(-/1/-)         means The first day of every month
                                         in every year.
               DATE(-/-/-)         means Everyday.

))TIME(hh:mm) - This is required. It gives the time of day at which the
operator command is to be executed. hh:mm is a 24-hour clock; i.e.,
afternoon hours are represented by values of 13 through 23 for hh.

))NAME(application name) - This is required. It gives a name by which
this and other automatic commands can be referenced. "Application name"
is a single name consisting of from one to eight alphameric or national
characters. The first character cannot be numeric.

All scheduled commands having the same application name can be
referenced as a group by the DISPLAY and DELETE commands. In addition,
the "scope" of overriding scheduled commands is defined in terms of
application names. Type HELP SCHEDULE O(OVERRIDE) for more information.

))WEEKDAY(day name) - This modifies the date on which the automatic
command is to be executed. If a date selected by the DATE operand does
not fall on the weekday named by this operand, then the execution of
the automatic command is delayed until the named weekday arrives.

"Day name" must be either the name of a weekday or a unique abreviation
of the name of a weekday.

"Day name" may be preceeded by a minus sign (-): e.g., WEEKDAY(-THU).
In this case if the selected date does not fall on the named weekday,
then the execution of the automatic command, instead of being delayed,
is moved forward to the desired weekday.

Examples:      DATE(2/1/80) WEEKDAY(THU)   means the Thursday that is
                                                 on or following
                                                 February 1, 1980. In
                                                 this case that would
                                                 be February 7th.
               DATE(-/1/-) WEEKDAY(MON)    means The first Monday of
                                                 every month.
               DATE(-/31/-) WEEKDAY(-FRI)  means the last Friday of
                                                 every month.
               DATE(6/-/83) WEEKDAY(TUE)   means every Tuesday in
                                                 June, 1983.
               DATE(-/-/-) WEEKDAY(WED)    means Every Wednesday.

The default value for WEEKDAY is ANY.

))WINDOW(hh:mm) - This gives the length of time following the
scheduled execution of an automatic command that the command can still
be executed if, for some reason such as a system crash, the command was
not executed when it was supposed to be.

The default value is "0:00" which has the special meaning "until
midnight".

The window cannot extend past midnight.

))IPLFORCED - This indicates that if the system crashes and is re-IPLed
within the "window" period for this automatic command, then this
command is to be executed after the IPL even if it has already been
executed before the IPL. The default is NOTIPLFORCED.

When a scheduled command defined with the IPLFORCED attribute is
displayed, the letter I appears in the FLAGS column.

))NOTIPLFORCED - nullifies IPLFORCED. Type HELP SCHEDULE O(IPLFORCED)
for more information.

))OVERRIDE - This causes the scheduling of certain automatic commands
to be overridden by this command for a particular date. The
circumstances are these.

         - The commands to be overridden must have the same application
           name as this command.
         - The commands to be overridden must not themselves be
           designated as "override" commands.
         - The commands to be overridden will be overridden only on
           those dates that this command will execute. The time of day
           is not relevent.

Use the "DISPLAY DATE(mm/dd/yy) NAME(application name) BOTH" command to
find which automatic commands are overridden. Those commands showing
the letter O in the FLAGS column override all commands without
the O flag.

The default is NOOVERRIDE.

))NOOVERRIDE - nullifies OVERRIDE. Type HELP SCHEDULE O(OVERRIDE) for
more information.

=DISPLAY=DI
)F FUNCTION -
The DISPLAY subcommand displays one or more entries in the automatic
operator commands schedule.

)X SYNTAX -
DISPLAY YESTERDAY × TODAY × TOMORROW × DATE(mm/dd/yy) × ANYTIME
                  × OBSOLETE × ID(identification numbers)
        NAME(application names) SYSID(system ids)
        OVERRIDE × NOOVERRIDE × BOTH × EITHER
        SHORT × LONG

Alias    - The minimum abreviation is DI.

Required - none.

Default  - ANYTIME SYSID(ALL) EITHER LONG and all names.

Notes    - YESTERDAY, TODAY, TOMORROW, DATE, ANYTIME, OBSOLETE, and ID
           are mutually exclusive.
         - OVERRIDE, NOOVERRIDE, BOTH, and EITHER are mutually
           exclusive.
         - SHORT and LONG are mutually exclusive.
         - Type HELP DISPLAY O(FLAGS) for a description of the
           displayed flag characters.

)O OPERANDS -

))YESTERDAY - limits the display of scheduled commands to those that
executed yesterday. The default is ANYTIME.

))TODAY - limits the display of scheduled commands to those that
execute today. The default is ANYTIME.

))TOMORROW - limits the display of scheduled commands to those that
will execute tomorrow. The default is ANYTIME.

))DATE(mm/dd/yy) - limits the display of scheduled commands to those
that will execute on the given date. If yy is 50 or less, then the
21st century is assumed. When this operand is omitted, the default is
ANYTIME.

))ANYTIME - does not limit the display of scheduled commands with
respect to either execution date or ID number or obsolescense. This is
the default.

An alias for ANYTIME is ALL.

))ALL - This is an alias for ANYTIME.

))OBSOLETE - limits the display to those scheduled commands that are
obsolete - i.e., those commands that can never execute again. The
default is ANYTIME.

When an obsolete scheduled command is displayed, the letter N appears
in the FLAGS column.

))ID(identification numbers) - limits the display of scheduled commands
to those having the given identification numbers. "Identification
numbers" is a list of one or more decimal numbers or pairs of decimal
numbers joined by a colin (:). Each number must be in the range of 0 to
65535. When joined pair of numbers are given, the second number must be
equal to or larger than the first. Such pairs indicate a range of
scheduled commands to be displayed.

When this operand is omitted, the default is ANYTIME.

))NAME(application names) - limits the display to only those scheduled
commands associated with the given applications. "Application names" is
a list of one or more names each of which consists of from one to eight
alphameric or national characters. The first character of each name
cannot be numeric.

Type HELP SCHEDULE O(NAME) for more information.

))SYSID(system ids) - For multi-system configurations. This operand
limits the selection of scheduled commands to those that are permitted
to be executed on the computers having the listed system ids.

A "system id" is a four-character identifier assigned by SMF to a
computer (for accounting purposes). Each character is alphameric.

The "SYSID" operand may specify any number of system identifiers. If a
scheduled command matches any listed identifier, then it is selected.

"SYSID(CRNT)" means the "current computer" - i.e., the computer which
you are currently logged on to.

"SYSID(ANY)" limits the selection to those scheduled commands that are
permitted to execute on any computer in the configuration.

"SYSID(ALL)" does not limit the selection. This is the default.

Example:

         SYSID(AAA6 ANY)
         This selects those scheduled commands that must be executed
         specifically by the computer named "AAA6" as well as those
         commands that may be executed by any computer in the
         configuration. (Scheduled commands that must be executed
         specifically by the "CC58" computer are not selected).

))SYSTEM(system ids) - This is an alias for SYSID.

))OVERRIDE - limits the display to only those scheduled commands that
are overrides. The default is EITHER. Type HELP SCHEDULE O(OVERRIDE)
for more information.

When an overriding scheduled command is displayed, the letter O appears
in the FLAGS column.

))NOOVERRIDE - limits the display to only those scheduled commands that
are not overrides. The default is EITHER. Type
HELP SCHEDULE O(OVERRIDE) for more information.

))BOTH - displays scheduled commands without reguard to whether or not
they are overrides. The default is EITHER. Type
HELP SCHEDULE O(OVERRIDE) for more information.

When an overriding scheduled command is displayed, the letter O appears
in the FLAGS column.

))EITHER - If the display of scheduled commands is limited to a
particular date (via the DATE, YESTERDAY, TODAY, or TOMORROW
operands), then for particular application names if overriding
scheduled commands exist for that date, then they are displayed and the
overridden commands are not displayed. If no overriding commands exist
for that date for the application, then the non-overriding commands are
displayed.

When an overriding scheduled command is displayed, the letter O appears
in the FLAGS column.

If a specific date is not given, then EITHER functions exactly like
BOTH.

EITHER is the default.

))LONG - displays a discriptive message for each scheduled command
selected for display. This is the default.

Aliases for LONG are PROMPT and NOPROMPT. (Don't ask why. That's just
the way it is).

))PROMPT - This is an alias for LONG.

))NOPROMPT - This is an alias for LONG.

))SHORT - displays only a count of the number of scheduled commands
selected by the DISPLAY command. Individual descriptive messages are
not generated. The default is LONG.

))FLAGS - Characters appearing in the FLAGS column of the displays have
the following meanings:

         I - This scheduled command has been defined with the
             IPLFORCED attribute. Type HELP SCHEDULE O(IPLFORCED) for
             more information.
         O - This scheduled command is an OVERRIDE. Type
             HELP SCHEDULE O(OVERRIDE) for more information.
         N - This scheduled command is OBSOLETE. It will never be
             executed again. Type HELP DISPLAY O(OBSOLETE) for
             more information.

=CHANGE=C
)F FUNCTION -
The CHANGE subcommand changes one or more characteristics of one or
more entries in the automatic operator commands schedule.

)X SYNTAX -
CHANGE ID(identification numbers) [NO]COPY
       COMMAND('operator command') DATE(mm/dd/yy) TIME(hh:mm)
       NAME(application name) SYSID(system id) WEEKDAY(day name)
       WINDOW(hh:mm) [NOT]IPLFORCED [NO]OVERRIDE

Alias    - The minimum abreviation is C.

Required - ID.

Defaults - NOCOPY
         - Leave unchanged those items not specified.

)O OPERANDS -

))ID(identification numbers) - identifies which scheduled commands are
to be changed. "Identification numbers" is a list of one or more
decimal numbers or pairs of decimal numbers joined by a colin (:). Each
number must be in the range of 0 to 65535. When joined pair of numbers
are given, the second number must be equal to or larger than the first.
Such pairs indicate a range of scheduled commands to be changed.

When multiple scheduled commands are being changed, they are all
changed identically.

The ID operand is required. There is no default.

))COPY - causes a copy of the original record(s) to be made before any
changes are made to that record. Thus when the COPY operand is used,
the original record(s) remains unchanged, and the changed record
becomes a new record in the SCHEDULE file.

The default is NOCOPY.

))NOCOPY - causes all changes to be made directly to the selected
record(s). A copy of the original record(s) is not kept.

This is the default.

))COMMAND('operator command') - gives the new operator command
that is to be automatically scheduled. The command may be any command
that can be issued from an operator's console. The command must be
enclosed within single quotes ('). Imbedded quotes must be represented
by pairs of quotes; i.e., a ' appearing within the command must be
represented by '' (not ").

This operand is optional. If omitted, then the operator command to be
issued remains unchanged.

))DATE(mm/dd/yy) - gives the new date or dates on
which the operator command is to be executed.

mm, dd, and/or yy may each be given as a dash (-). This is a "wild
card" character that causes that field to match any value. For example,
a dash given for mm means "any month".

If yy is equal to or less than 50, then the 21st century is assumed.

When - is given for mm, then a value of 31 given for dd means "the
last day of the month" - even those months that are shorter than 31
days.

Examples:      DATE(2/9/80)        means February 2, 1980.
               DATE(2/8/40)        means February 2, 2040.
               DATE(-/31/81)       means The last day of every month in
                                         1981.
               DATE(-/1/-)         means The first day of every month
                                         in every year.
               DATE(-/-/-)         means Everyday.

))TIME(hh:mm) - gives the new time of day at which the
operator command is to be executed. hh:mm is a 24-hour clock; i.e.,
afternoon hours are represented by values of 13 through 23 for hh.

))NAME(application name) - gives a new name by which
this automatic command can be referenced. "Application name"
is a single name consisting of from one to eight alphameric or national
characters. The first character cannot be numeric.

All scheduled commands having the same application name can be
referenced as a group by the DISPLAY and DELETE commands. In addition,
the "scope" of overriding scheduled commands is defined in terms of
application names. Type HELP CHANGE O(OVERRIDE) for more information.

))SYSID(system id) - For multi-system configurations, this operand
specifies on which computer this scheduled command is permitted to be
executed. "System id" must be the "SMF-id" of the desired computer.
System ids consist of from one to four alphameric characters.

"SYSID(CRNT)" means the "current computer" - i.e., the computer which
you are currently logged on to.

"SYSID(ANY)" means "any computer". The scheduled command may be
executed by any computer in the configuration - which ever one gets
around to it first.

))SYSTEM(system id) - This is an alias for SYSID.

))WEEKDAY(day name) - modifies the date on which the automatic
command is to be executed. If a date selected by the DATE operand does
not fall on the weekday named by this operand, then the execution of
the automatic command is delayed until the named weekday arrives.

"Day name" must be either the name of a weekday or a unique abreviation
of the name of a weekday.

"Day name" may be preceeded by a minus sign (-): e.g., WEEKDAY(-THU).
In this case if the selected date does not fall on the named weekday,
then the execution of the automatic command, instead of being delayed,
is moved forward to the desired weekday.

Examples:      DATE(2/1/80) WEEKDAY(THU)   means the Thursday that is
                                                 on or following
                                                 February 1, 1980. In
                                                 this case that would
                                                 be February 7th.
               DATE(-/1/-) WEEKDAY(MON)    means The first Monday of
                                                 every month.
               DATE(-/31/-) WEEKDAY(-FRI)  means the last Friday of
                                                 every month.
               DATE(6/-/83) WEEKDAY(TUE)   means every Tuesday in
                                                 June, 1983.
               DATE(-/-/-) WEEKDAY(WED)    means Every Wednesday.

Specifying WEEKDAY(ANY) removes the weekday modifier from the
scheduled commands being changed.

))WINDOW(hh:mm) - gives the length of time following the
scheduled execution of an automatic command that the command can still
be executed if, for some reason such as a system crash, the command was
not executed when it was supposed to be.

The window cannot extend past midnight.

The special value "0:00" has the meaning "until midnight".

))IPLFORCED - This indicates that if the system crashes and is re-IPLed
within the "window" period for this automatic command, then this
command is to be executed after the IPL even if it has already been
executed before the IPL.

When a scheduled command defined with the IPLFORCED attribute is
displayed, the letter I appears in the FLAGS column.

))NOTIPLFORCED - nullifies IPLFORCED. Type HELP CHANGE O(IPLFORCED)
for more information.

))OVERRIDE - This causes the scheduling of certain automatic commands
to be overridden by this command for a particular date. The
circumstances are these.

         - The commands to be overridden must have the same application
           name as this command.
         - The commands to be overridden must not themselves be
           designated as "override" commands.
         - The commands to be overridden will be overridden only on
           those dates that this command will execute. The time of day
           is not relevent.

Use the "DISPLAY DATE(mm/dd/yy) NAME(application name) BOTH" command to
find which automatic commands are overridden. Those commands showing
the letter O in the FLAGS column override all commands without
the O flag.

))NOOVERRIDE - nullifies OVERRIDE. Type HELP CHANGE O(OVERRIDE) for
more information.

=DELETE=DE
)F FUNCTION -
The DELETE subcommand removes one or more entries from the automatic
operator commands schedule.

the default.

An alias for ANYTIME is ALL.

))ALL - This is an alias for ANYTIME.

))OBSOLETE - limits the deletion to those scheduled commands that are
obsolete - i.e., those commands that can never execute again. The
default is ANYTIME.

))ID(identification numbers) - limits the deletion of scheduled
commands to those having the given identification numbers.
"Identification numbers" is a list of one or more decimal numbers or
pairs of decimal numbers joined by a colin (:). Each number must be in
the range of 0 to 65535. When joined pairs of numbers are given, the
second number must be equal to or larger than the first. Such pairs
indicate a range of  scheduled commands to be deleted.

))NAME(application names) - limits the deletion to only those scheduled
commands associated with the given applications. "Application names" is
a list of one or more names each of which consists of from one to eight
alphameric or national characters. The first character of each name
cannot be numeric.

Type HELP SCHEDULE O(NAME) for more information.

))SYSID(system ids) - For multi-system configurations. This operand
limits the selection of scheduled commands to those that are permitted
to be executed on the computers having the listed system ids.

A "system id" is a four-character identifier assigned by SMF to a
computer (for accounting purposes). Each character is alphameric.

The "SYSID" operand may specify any number of system identifiers. If a
scheduled command matches any listed identifier, then it is selected.

"SYSID(CRNT)" means the "current computer" - i.e., the computer which
you are currently logged on to.

"SYSID(ANY)" limits the selection to those scheduled commands that are
permitted to execute on any computer in the configuration.

"SYSID(ALL)" does not limit the selection. This is the default.

Example:

         SYSID(AAA6 ANY)
         This selects those scheduled commands that must be executed
         specifically by the computer named "AAA6" as well as those
         commands that may be executed by any computer in the

))EITHER - If the deletion of scheduled commands is limited to a
particular date (via the DATE, YESTERDAY, TODAY, or TOMORROW
operands), then for particular application names if overriding
scheduled commands exist for that date, then they are deleted and the
overridden commands are not deleted. If no overriding commands exist
for that date for the application, then the non-overriding commands are
deleted.

If a specific date is not given, then EITHER functions exactly like
BOTH.

EITHER is the default.

))PROMPT - displays a descriptive message for each scheduled command to
be deleted, and then prompts you to may a final delete/no-delete
decision for that scheduled command. This is the default.

prompted for a final delete/no-delete decision.

The default is PROMPT.

the automatic operator commands schedule.
