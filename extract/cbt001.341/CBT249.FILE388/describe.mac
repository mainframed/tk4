FUNCTIONAL SUMMARY

The SCHEDULE facility makes it possible to schedule the automatic
execution of any operator command at any time of day on any date.
The execution of the command can be repeated according to any of
a large variety of daily, weekly, monthly, and/or yearly repeat cycles.
(See the accompanying TSO HELP file for details).

The SCHEDULE facility supports an override capability whereby
particular sets of periodically scheduled commands can be overridden on
selected dates (such as holidays) with another set of commands to be
executed instead. Such overrides can be defined even years in advance,
if desired.

The SCHEDULE facility permits the definition of a "window" period
(defined separately for each scheduled automatic command) whereby:

   - If the system is down at the time that a command is scheduled to
     be executed,

   - But if the system comes up any time during the specified "window
     period" following the command's scheduled time,

   - Then that command will be executed anyway.

Thus the execution of important commands won't be missed just because
the system wasn't up in time.

In JES2 "Multi-Access Spool" configurations, the SCHEDULE facility's
VSAM data base can be shared between multiple systems, and operator
commands can be scheduled to execute on either one or the other (or
"any") of the attached CPUs.

The SCHEDULE facility can maintain a log file where it records a
timestamped copy of all operator commands that it issues.

The SCHEDULE facility is designed to execute in a JES2 environment. If
you wish to use it in a JES3 system, then you must make suitable
modifications to the facility's source code.



OPERATIONAL OVERVIEW

This SCHEDULE facility consists of two programs: an authorized TSO
command processor named SCHEDULE, and an authorized started task named
SCHEDRUN. The TSO command ("SCHEDULE") is used to create, display, and
manipulate the schedule of automatic operator commands. (This schedule
is kept in a VSAM key-sequenced dataset. It is NOT the same schedule
implemented by the JES2 "automatic commands facility"). The
started-task ("SCHEDRUN") reads the schedule of automatic commands, and
executes them at the appointed time.

Both the SCHEDULE TSO command and the SCHEDRUN started-task will
attempt to use Yale's GSAM IUP (available through IBM) to access the
"schedule" VSAM dataset. If the GSAM IUP is not available, the SCHEDULE
facility will use normal dataset allocation and VSAM I/O to access the
VSAM file.

The SCHEDULE TSO command operates as follows:

   - If a suitably authorized TSO user wishes to examine or modify the
     automatic commands schedule, he types SCHEDULE. He is then placed
     in subcommand mode. The user can then use the following
     subcommands:

     - HELP to learn how to use the SCHEDULE facility.

     - DISPLAY to examine the commands schedule.

     - SCHEDULE to add new entries to the commands schedule.

     - CHANGE either to change existing command schedule entries or to
       create new entries that are modelled on existing entries.

     - DELETE to delete entries from the commands schedule.

     - END to leave the SCHEDULE command processor and return to READY.

   - Upon leaving the SCHEDULE command processor, if the user has done
     anything to change the commands schedule, then a "S SCHEDRUN"
     operator command is automatically issued (via SVC 34) so that the
     next execution time of the next automatic operator command can be
     re-evaluated.

   - If Yale's GSAM IUP is not installed, then whenever the SCHEDULE
     command processor is invoked, it searches for its VSAM schedule
     dataset as follows:

     - If a ddname of SCHEDULE has been pre-allocated, then the command
       processor assumes that it points to the desired VSAM dataset, so
       it opens it and uses it.

     - If the SCHEDULE ddname cannot be found, then the command
       processor attempts to dynamically allocate (SHR) a dataset named
       SYSVSAM.SCHEDULE. If this succeeds, then it is opened and used.

     - If the dynamic allocation fails, then the SCHEDULE command
       processor also fails.

The SCHEDRUN started-task operates as follows:

   - Whenever it executes, it examines the automatic schedule to
     determine if any automatic commands are schedule to be issued
     right now. If so, then it issues SVC 34 to execute them.

   - It then examines the schedule to see when the next automatic
     command needs to be executed. It then issues a JES2 "$TA ..."
     command that will cause SCHEDRUN to be re-executed either at that
     time or at the next midnight, which ever is sooner. Thus unless
     the "$TA" commands are interfered with, SCHEDRUN will execute
     automatically whenever necessary.

Note, "extra" executions of SCHEDRUN do no damage. If SCHEDRUN is
executed at any time when no automatic commands are scheduled,
it does nothing more than determine when it next needs to be executed
and schedules a JES2 automatic command "$TA ..." to cause itself to be
re-executed at the correct time.

After each IPL a "S SCHEDRUN" operator command needs to be issued in
order to get the schedule process going. This can be done in any of the
following ways:

   - The operator can be instructed to manually issue the "S SCHEDRUN"
     command during each IPL (not recommended since he might forget).

   - A "S SCHEDRUN" command may be placed in SYS1.PARMLIB(COMMND00).

   - A "$VS,'S SCHEDRUN'" command may be placed among the JES2
     initialization parameters.



THE INSTALLATION OF THE SCHEDULE FACILITY

 1.) Use IEBCOPY to load the SCHEDULE source library to disk. (Call it
     SYS3.SCHEDULE.SOURCLIB).

 2.) Use IEBCOPY to load the "#-macros" (miscellaneous useful macros)
     to disk. (Call it SYS3.COLE.MACLIB).

 3.) In the initialization section of the source code for both the
     SCHEDULE and SCHEDRUN programs, there is rudimentary code for
     checking the authority of the invoking user. Make any
     modifications to this code that your installation deems necessary.

 4.) Assemble and linkedit SYS3.SCHEDULE.SOURCLIB(SCHEDULE) into an
     authorized TSO commands library. Use
     SYS3.SCHEDULE.SOURCLIB(ASMSCHED) as model JCL. Note the JCL
     changes to be made if the Yale GSAM IUP is installed on your
     system.

 5.) Update the IKJEFTE2 CSECT (Privileged TSO commands) of the
     IKJEFT02 load module (the TSO TMP) to include the names of the
     SCHEDULE command and its chosen aliases, if any.

 6.) Assemble and linkedit SYS3.SCHEDULE.SOURCLIB(SCHEDRUN) into an
     authorized link-library. Use SYS3.SCHEDULE.SOURCLIB(ASMSRUN) as
     model JCL. Note the JCL changes to be made if the Yale GSAM IUP is
     installed on your system.

 7.) Create, in a proclib accessable to started-tasks, a proc named
     SCHEDRUN. This proc should be modelled on
     SYS3.SCHEDULE.SOURCLIB(SRUNPROC). Note, the SCHEDLOG DD may be
     DUMMYed out. Also note the JCL changes to be made if the Yale
     GSAM IUP is installed on your system.

     - If this proc is named anything other than SCHEDRUN, then the
       source for both the SCHEDRUN started-task and the SCHEDULE
       TSO command must be suitably modified.

 8.) If a SCHEDLOG dataset is to be used, then:

     - Allocate one with the following attributes: DCB=(DSORG=PS,
       RECFM=VB,LRECL=267,BLKSIZE=nnn)

     - Implement a facility to periodically print it out and empty it.
       This might consist of a started task (or other automatically
       readable job) that can be invoked periodically (say monthly) by
       the schedule facility itself.

 9.) Allocate the VSAM dataset that will contain the schedule of
     automatic commands. Use the CLIST in
     SYS3.SCHEDULE.SOURCLIB(SCHEDALC) as a model.

     - If Yale's GSAM IUP is not installed, then the VSAM dataset
       should be named SYSVSAM.SCHEDULE. If you wish to use a different
       name, then the source for the SCHEDULE TSO command must be
       suitably modified.

     - If Yale's GSAM IUP is installed, then this VSAM dataset must be
       defined to GSAM with the file name SCHEDULE.

10.) Copy SCHEDULE's HELP file from SYS3.SCHEDULE.SOURCLIB(TSOHELP) to
     a suitable TSO HELP library (one that is accessible only to
     authorized members of your staff). Name the file "SCHEDULE" and
     give it any alias names that you expect to use for referencing the
     SCHEDULE command.

11.) Print out a listing of the HELP file and study it to learn how to
     use the SCHEDULE command and its subcommands.

12.) Provide a mechanism for automatically issuing the "S SCHEDRUN"
     command during every IPL. This can be accomplished by:

     - putting a "S SCHEDRUN" command in SYS1.PARMLIB(COMMND00), or by

     - putting a "$VS,'S SCHEDRUN'" command into the JES2
       initialization parameters dataset.

13.) Logon to TSO and type SCHEDULE. This will initialize schedule's
     VSAM dataset (first time only) and then place you in subcommand
     mode where you can define the automatic commands schedule that you
     desire.
