PROD - Production JCL Submission Procedure


         PROD is a proc which will submit jcl to the internal reader
from a jcl library.
To use:  S PROD from the master operator console
Message 'PROD099A   ENTER JOBNAME OR JOBSTREAM NAME' will be displayed.
Reply is one of the following:

         1) jobname - member name on jcl library
                      ex. xx,MARGIN1 will submit the job with member
                      name MARGIN1
         2) jobstream name - an asterisk(*) followed by a 1-7 character
                             jobname prefix.  This will submit all jobs
                             specified within the member name
                             ex. xx,*COM2 will submit all jobs that are
                             listed in the member @COM2.

An alternate method of using PROD is to specify the jobname or
jobstream name when PROD is started, i.e., S PROD,JOB=jobname
                                           S PROD,JOB=jobstream name


A message that may occassionally appear is:
  'PROD014A   INPUT CTL CARD UPDATE FOR JOBNAME=jobname'
This message asks whether or not I/O Control has updated a control card
for this jobname. If the answer is yes, then reply Y; any other reply
assumes no.

If the reply is Y then the date and time of last update to the member
specified in an I/O control JCL statement will be displayed on the
operator's console along with the actual data cards in the library.


To end PROD specify EOJ or END to the message PROD099A ENTER JOBNAME
OR JOBSTREAM NAME.

PROD099A   ENTER JOBNAME OR JOBSTREAM NAME
           This is a request for a jobname, or, jobstream prefix
           specified as an asterisk followed by the jobstream name





For Technical Support:  To mark a job as having IOC  control cards
                        insert an asterisk immediately after the JOB
                        keyword (i.e., JOB*) on the jobcard.

                        If there are libraries which must be updated
                        before the job runs mark the DD statement
                        that contains the DSNAME with a '*/' in
                        columns 1 and 2.  PROD will open, read and
                        display on the operator console the data in all
                        DSNAMEs so marked.


                        When creating jobstreams, the procedure is to
                        create a member beginning with an at(@) sign
                        followed by the jobstream name.  Each member
                        will contain a list of jobnames to be included
                        in that jobstream.  The jobnames are entered in
                        columns 1 - 72  separated by commas and/or
                        blanks.  Up to 300 jobnames may be specified.


                        To test changes made to the JCL library
                        use clist PRODTEST.

                        To test I/O control library modifications
                        use clist PRODOPER.
