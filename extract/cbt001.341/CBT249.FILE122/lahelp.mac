)F  LOGALLOC - FUNCTION
    THE FUNCTION OF THE LOGALLOC COMMAND IS TO MARK ALL
    CURRENTLY ALLOCATED DATASETS AS PERMANENTLY ALLOCATED.

    DATASETS MARKED PERMANENTLY ALLOCATED ARE NOT FREED BY
    THE 'FREEALL' COMMAND. THEY MAY, HOWEVER, BE EXPLICITLY
    FREED BY USING THE 'FREE' COMMAND AND SPECIFYING THE
    DSNAME.

    THE 'LOGALLOC' COMMAND MAY BE USED IN CONJUNCTION
    WITH THE MEMBER (LOGON) IN THE USER'S LIB.CLIST
    DATASET TO CUSTOMIZE LOGON PROCEDURES TO A SPECIFIC
    USER'S REQUIREMENTS. THE LIB.CLIST(LOGON) COMMAND
    PROCEDURE IS AUTOMATICALLY INVOKED IF THE RYOLOGON
    (ROLL-YOUR-OWN) LOGON PROCEDURE IS USED.

    EXAMPLE OF THE (LOGON) MEMBER IN THE LIB.CLIST
    DATASET TO ALLOW THE USER'S COMMAND PROCEDURE LIBRARY
    DATASET TO BE USED FOR IMPLICIT COMMAND PROCEDURE
    INVOCATION:

      PROC 0
      FREE F(SYSPROC)
      ALLOC F(SYSPROC) DA(MYOWN.CLIST 'SYS1.CMDPROC') SHR
      LOGALLOC
      END

    LOGALLOC IS DESIGNED PRIMARILY TO BE USED IN CONJUNCTION
    WITH RYOLOGON AND THE LIB.CLIST(LOGON) PROCEDURE, BUT IT MAY
    BE INVOKED AT ANY TIME DURING A TSO SESSION.
