)F FUNCTION -
   THE PRINTODD COMMAND CAN BE USED TO OBTAIN HARDCOPY
   OF DATA SETS WHICH ARE ALLOCATED TO A SPECIFIC
   DDNAME THROUGH FOREGROUND COPYING TO SYSOUT.
   THE COMMAND PRINTS A DATASET(S) WHICH IS SEQUENTIAL
   OR PARTITIONED, BLOCKED OR UNBLOCKED, WITH FIXED,
   VARIABLE, OR UNDEFINED LENGTH RECORDS OF ANY LENGTH
   UP TO A FULL TRACK.

   PRINTODD MAY BE USED TO PRINT OUTPUT FROM PROGRAMS
   RUN UNDER TSO BUT WHICH REQUIRE SPECIAL OUTPUT
   PARAMETERS WHICH CANNOT BE SPECIFIED VIA THE
   ATTRIBUTE AND ALLOCATE COMMANDS. AN EXAMPLE OF
   ITS USE IS:

       ALLOC FILE(OUT) SP(10 10) TR  <--- ALLOC A TEMPORARY DATASET
       CALL MYLIB(MYPROG)            <--- RUN PROGRAM TO CREATE OUTPUT
       PODD OUT CH(GI12) BURST       <--- PRINT THE OUTPUT

)O OPERANDS -
))DDNAME    - THE DDNAME WHICH IS ALLOCATED TO THE DATA SET
            WHICH IS TO BE PRINTED. THIS FILE MAY BE ALLOCATED
            TO EITHER A PERMANENT OR A TEMPORARY DATASET. THE
            DATASET MUST BE SEQUENTIAL OR PARTITIONED AND
            CONTAIN VALID DATA.
))CLASS('CLASS') - SYSOUT CLASS IN WHICH OUTPUT IS TO BE
            PRINTED.  DEFAULT IS A.
))COPIES('NNN') - NUMBER OF COPIES TO BE PRINTED.
            DEFAULT IS 1.
))DEST('REMOTE') - REMOTE LOCATION TO WHICH SYSOUT DATA SETS
            ARE TO BE ROUTED.
))HOLD      - OUTPUT IS TO BE PLACED ON A HOLD QUEUE UPON
            DEALLOCATION.
))NOHOLD    - OUTPUT IS NOT TO BE PLACED ON A HOLD QUEUE
            UPON DEALLOCATION.
))LIST      - MEMBER NAMES ARE ONLY TO BE LISTED UNLESS
            PRINT IS EXPLICITLY STATED.
))NOLIST    - MEMBER NAMES ARE NOT TO BE LISTED (ONLY
            PRINTED UNLESS NOPRINT IS EXPLICITLY STATED).
))PRINT     - MEMBERS ARE ONLY TO BE PRINTED (NOT LISTED
            UNLESS LIST IS EXPLICITLY STATED).
))NOPRINT   - MEMBERS ARE NOT TO BE PRINTED (ONLY LISTED
            UNLESS NOLIST IS EXPLICITLY STATED).
))FORMS('FORM')  - FORM TO BE USED WHEN THE DATA SET IS PRINTED.
                  (1-4 CHARACTER FORM NAME)
))TRAIN('IMAGE') - PRINT IMAGE TO BE USED WHEN PRINTED.
            THIS IS OFTEN CALLED THE UCS.
            (1-4 CHARACTER PRINT IMAGE NAME)
))HEADING     - OUTPUT IS TO HAVE HEADING INFORMATION.
                THIS CONTAINS THE DATASET NAME.
))NOHEADING   - OUTPUT IS NOT HAVE HEADING INFORMATION.
))SS        - OUTPUT IS TO BE SINGLE SPACED BETWEEN LINES
))DS        - OUTPUT IS TO BE DOUBLE SPACED BETWEEN LINES
            (MULTIPLE LINE RECORDS WILL NOT BE SPLIT BETWEEN PAGES)
))CAPS      - OUTPUT IS TO BE CONVERTED TO UPPER CASE
            PRIOR TO PRINTING.
))ASIS      - OUTPUT IS NOT TO BE CONVERTED TO UPPER CASE
            PRIOR TO PRINTING.(IT IS LEFT AS IT IS)
))LINELENGTH=LL('NNN') - NUMBER OF CHARACTERS ON EACH LINE OF
            PRINTED OUTPUT BETWEEN 1 AND 208 CHARACTERS WITH A DEFAULT
            OF 132.  LINES LONGER THAN SPECIFIED LINELENGTH WILL
            BE PRINTED ON MULTIPLE LINES.
))PAGELENGTH=PL('NN') - NUMBER OF LINES PER PAGE, BETWEEN 1 AND 120
            LINES WITH A DEFAULT OF 60.
))VOLUME('VOLSER') - VOLUME SERIAL OF VOLUME ON WHICH DATA SETS
            TO BE PRINTED ARE FOUND.  THIS VOLUME SERIAL
            WILL BE USED FOR ALL DATA SETS SPECIFIED IN
            THE DATA SET LIST.
))BURST     - OUTPUT IS TO BE TRIMMED AND BURST.   *** 3800 ONLY ***
))NOBURST   - OUTPUT WILL BE PRINTED ON CONTINUOUS FORMS.
))FLASH('FLASHNAME') - THE NAME OF THE OVERLAY     *** 3800 ONLY ***
            WHICH IS TO BE FLASHED ON ALL OUTPUT.
))CHARS('CHARACTER-SET-NAME(S)') - THE NAME, OR    *** 3800 ONLY ***
            NAMES, OF THE 3800 CHARACTER SETS
            WHICH ARE TO BE USED TO PRINT THE
            DATA. IF MORE THAN ONE CHARACTER SET
            NAME IS GIVEN, THE DATA SHOULD HAVE
            THE CHARACTER SET ID SPECIFIED IN THE
            SECOND CHARACTER OF EACH LINE. OPTCD=J
            IS ASSUMED. SEE THE JCL REFERENCE
            MANUAL FOR MORE INFORMATION.
