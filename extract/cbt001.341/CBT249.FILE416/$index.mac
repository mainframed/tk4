THIS PDS CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING PROGRAMS:

CATLIST   -  THIS PROGRAM WILL DO A VERY FAST LISTING OF AN ICF CATALOG
             FOR GENERATIONDATASETS AND NONVSAM DATASETS.  THE LISTING
             IS IN THE SAME FORMAT AS IDCAMS (WE USED IT TO BUILD A TMC)
             BUT THE OUTPUT FORMAT WOULD BE EASY TO CHANGE.  THE PROGRAM
             MUST RUN AUTHORIZED (AC=1) BECAUSE IT OPENS THE CATALOG AS
             A DATASET.  ALSO THERE IS A MODESET WE USED TO ALLOW US TO
             BYPASS RACF CHECKING. (RACF THINKS YOU NEED ALTER ACCESS TO
             READ THE DATASET AND ALL OF OUR CATALOGS HAVE A UACC OF
             UPDATE). ALL THAT WAS DONE IN KEY ZERO WAS TO SET THE
             JSCBPASS BIT ON.  THE SPEED INCREASE OF THIS PROGRAM WAS
             SEVERAL ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE BETTER THAN IDCAMS ON A LARGE
             ICF CATALOG.

CMDLOFF   -  THIS COMMAND WILL ISSUE THE COMMAND PASSED TO IT AND
             THEN CAUSE LOGOFF OF THE USER.  THIS IS USEFUL IN THE
             SITUATION WHERE YOU WANT A USER TO EXIST IN A PROTECTED
             ENVIRONMENT. EX. CMDLOFF ISPSTART PANEL(USERSEL)

DLXAUTHC  -  THIS COMMAND WILL ISSUE THE COMMAND PASSED TO AFTER
             SETTING THE JSCBAUTH BIT ON. WHEN THE COMMAND COMPLETES
             THE JSCBAUTH BIT WILL BE SET OFF. THE JSCB TAMPERING IS
             DONE IN A USER SVC. YOU MUST REPLACE THE USERSVC MACRO
             WITH YOUR OWN INTEGRITY VIOLATION. THIS COMMAND IS
             ESPECIALLY USEFUL FOR ENTERING RACF COMMANDS FROM
             ISPF DIALOGS.  EX. DLXAUTHC LISTDSD DA('DSN1.EXAMPLE') ALL

EXIMPORT     DESCRIPTIVE NAME = GENERATE THE JCL NECESSARY FOR
             EXPORTING AND IMPORTING THE DATA SETS ON A
             SPECIFIED VOLUME.
             CREATES ONE DATA SET WITH THE JCL FOR EXPORTING
             THE DATA SETS ON A SPECIFIED VOLUME AND ANOTHER
             FOR IMPORTING THE SAME DATA SETS.  FOR VSAM
             FILES, THE JCL WILL BE SET UP TO EXECUTE
             IDCAMS, EXPORTING TO TAPE AND THEN IMPORTING
             BACK ONTO THE SAME VOLUME FROM THE TAPE.
             FOR NON-VSAM PS FILES, THE PROGRAM IEBGENER IS
             EXECUTED TO COPY THE DATA SET TO TAPE AND THEN
             BACK TO THE SAME VOLUME.  FOR PO FILES, IEBCOPY
             IS USED.  ALSO A CLIST IS GENERATED TO SCRATCH
             THE TAPE FILES AFTER THE DATA SETS HAVE BEEN
             IMPORTED.

IGGPRE00     DF/DS ALLOCATE PRE PROCCESSING EXIT TESTER'

INMRZ01      RECEIVE INITIALIZATION EXIT
             ALLOWS AUTHORIZATION CHECKING FOR USER
             IDS EXECUTING RECEIVE IN BACKGROUND.

INMRZ11      RECEIVE PRE-PROCESSING EXIT
             ALLOWS RECEIVE TO RUN IN BACKGROUND WITH
             THE  EXIT REPLACING THE USER INTERACTION IN
             DETERMINING THE RECEIVING DATA SET NAME.

RACFALT   -  THIS PROGRAM WILL GENERATE A CLIST TO CHANGE THE VOLUME
             SERIAL NUMBERS IN THE RACF PROFILES OF ALL NONVSAM DATASETS
             ON A SPECIFIED VOLUME.

RACFCLST  -  THIS PROGRAM WILL GENERATE A CLIST TO REDEFINE (VIA RACF
             COMMANDS DELDSD, ADDSD, AND PERMIT) FOR ALL DATASETS ON A
             SPECIFIED VOLUME. DUE TO USE OF RACF INTERNAL MACROS THIS
             PROGRAM MUST BE RUN AUTHORIZED. IF SYSIN IS PRESENT YOU
             CAN INCLUDE COMMANDS TO SELECT BY DATASET GROUP ON A VOLUME
             AND/OR DATASET NAME WITH OR WITHOUT VOLUME SPECIFICATION.
             WARNING: IF SYSIN IS PRESENT AND DUMMIED OUT OR EMPTY THEN
             A NULL CLIST WILL BE CREATED.
