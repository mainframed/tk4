SHARE CODE - UF


THIS VERSION OF QUEUE WAS DERIVED FROM FILE 278 OF THE CBT MODS TAPE,
WHICH HAD BEEN OBTAINED FROM VERSION 18 OF THE SHARE JES2 PROJECT TAPE.

UF001  ALLOW QUEUE COMMAND TO ASSEMBLE USING NJE3.1 SOURCE CODE.
       A FEW EQUATES AND ADDITIONAL DSECTS WERE INCLUDED, WHICH SHOULD
       BE OK FOR NON-NJE SOURCE AS WELL.

UF002  ALLOW QCOMMON TO BE LINKED IN FOR TESTING.
       WE RUN WITH SEVERAL DIFFERENT SPOOL PACK FORMATS DURING TEST,
       AND IT IS CONVENIENT TO HAVE MULTIPLE VERSIONS OF QUEUE TO
       SUPPORT THESE DIFFERENT TEST VERSIONS.
       IT IS ALSO MUCH SIMPLER TO RUN UNDER TSO TEST.

UF003  SUPPORT FOR 3278 MODELS 2, 4, AND 5.
       WE HAVE A WIDE ASSORTMENT OF TERMINALS IN-HOUSE, SO QUEUE WAS
       MODIFIED TO SUPPORT ALL TERMINAL TYPES AS BASIC MODEL 2, AND
       TO ALLOW THE USER TO SWITCH TO THE LARGER SCREEN FORMAT AT ANY
       TIME DURING HIS SESSION.
       THIS CODE IS CURRENTLY RUNNING UNDER ACF/VTAM REL 2, BUT WAS
       DEVELOPED UNDER ACF/VTAM REL 1, AND HAS ALSO RUN WITH TCAM AT
       THE 8011 LEVEL.

UF004  ADD A TITLE CARD FOR Q0 (QCOMMON).

UF005  DO NOT CHECK FOR JOBNAME MATCHING TSO LOGON ID IF QXAUTH=1.
       ALSO ALLOW READING DSID'S LESS THAN 101 IF QXAUTH=1.
       DSID'S LESS THAN 101 ARE SOMETIMES USEFUL TO LOOK AT;  THE
       INTERNAL TEXT FILE MAKES IT EASIER TO LOCATE THE PROPPER DSID
       IN A SYSGEN WHERE ALL STEPNAMES ARE "ASM", AND IN A VM NETWORK
       ENVIRONMENT IT IS COMMON TO HAVE OUTPUT DSID'S OF 1.

UF006  ONLY READ THE CHECKPOINT IF THE INFORMATION IS NEEDED.
       THE READ OF THE CHECKPOINT IS REMOVED FROM THE MAIN EXECUTION
       LOOP, SINCE IT IS REALLY SILLY TO READ A LARGE CHECKPOINT DATASET
       WHEN THE USER COMMAND IS TO JUST REPOSTITION WITHIN THE CURRENT
       FILE.

UF007  CHANGE COMMANDS "DD *" AND "L * DSID" TO USE THE LAST JOBNAME
       IF A "*" IS SPECIFIED.  THIS MAKES IT EASIER TO TYPE, AND CODE
       IS ADDED TO SKIP THE CHECKPOINT READ FOR PERFORMANCE REASONS.

UF008  HAVE THE FINDPDDB ROUTINE START AT THE FIRST IOT IF PDDB IS NOT
       FOUND.  A MIXTURE OF SPIN AND REGULAR PDDB'S USED TO CAUSE
       THE ROUTINE TO SCAN TO THE END OF THE IOT'S AND STAY THERE WHILE
       TRYING TO LOCATE THE FIRST REGULAR PDDB AFTER A SPUN ONE.
