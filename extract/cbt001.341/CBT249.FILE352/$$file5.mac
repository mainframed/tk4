./       ADD   NAME=$
)F       THE $ COMMAND CAN BE USED IN PLACE OF THE CALL COMMAND
         FOR PROGRAMS THAT ARE IN THE LINK LIST DATA SETS;
         THIS INCLUDES ALL COMPILERS AND UTILITIES.

         ADVANTAGES OF THE $ COMMAND OVER CALL COMMAND:
         1) THE $ COMMAND REQUIRES NO DYNAMIC DD CARD NOR
            ALLOCATION AND IS, THEREFORE, CONSIDERABLY FASTER;
         2) THE $ COMMAND SIMPLIFIES SYNTAX AND REQUIRES
            LESS TYPING;
         3) THE $ COMMAND ALLOWS USE OF PROGRAMS IN ANY OF
            THE LINKLIB DATA SETS, WITHOUT KNOWING WHICH OF THE
            DATA SETS THE PROGRAM IS IN.
         DISADVANTAGES OF THE $ COMMAND:
         THE ONLY DISADVANTAGE OF THE $ COMMAND IS THAT
         THE PROGRAM BEING CALLED MUST BE IN A LINKLIB DATA SET;
         HENCE, TO CALL A USER'S PROGRAM FROM HIS LIBRARY, THE
         CALL COMMAND MUST STILL BE USED.
)X       THE SYNTAX OF THE $ COMMAND IS AS FOLLOWS:
         $ PROGRAM 'PARM'
         WHERE PROGRAM IS THE NAME OF THE PROGRAM TO BE EXECUTED AND
         'PARM' IS AN OPTIONAL PARM FIELD OF UP TO 100 CHARACTERS
         WHICH IS TO BE PASSED TO THE PROGRAM.
)O       THE OPERANDS OF THE $ COMMAND ARE:
         PROGRAM - THE 1 TO 8 CHARACTER NAME OF THE PROGRAM TO BE
                   EXECUTED.
         'PARM'  - THE OPTIONAL 0 TO 100 CHARACTER STRING, ENCLOSED IN
                   QUOTES, REPRESENTING THE PARAMETER TO BE PASSED TO
                   THE PROGRAM.

         EXAMPLE - INVOKING IEHLIST.  SYSPRINT AND SYSIN MUST BE
                   PREVIOUSLY ALLOCATED.

                   $ IEHLIST

./       ADD   NAME=DDSTAR
)F FUNCTION
  The DDSTAR command is intended for use in command procedures (CLISTS).
  It is used to spool into a sequential dataset all card images that
  occur between it and an eof card. The cards are spooled with an
  LRECL of 80.  Symbolic parameters may be used on the spooled cards.
  Clist commands (e.g. WRITE, IF-THEN-ELSE, DO-END etc.) may be inter-
  mixed, and will be ignored by DDSTAR.  Column 1 of the card is
  defined as the first non-blank char on the line.  The special char-
  acter '@' may be used to signify the starting col of the card image;
  it will be replaced by a blank. '@@' indicates a literal 'at' sign
  as the first character on the card.  Any '@' chars after the first
  are not scanned or replaced.
  The card image after substitution of symbolic parameters will be
  truncated to 80 characters.  The spooling is terminated when a card
  that has only a !EOD or other user specified end of file indicator
  in the first 8 columns.

  NOTE:  do NOT attempt to spool cards via the TERMIN command..DDSTAR
         only reads commands from a clist.

EXAMPLE -

        DDSTAR FI(SYSIN) DA(XYZ) NEW CATLG EOF(%%%%)

   will free file SYSIN, allocate a new dataset '$user.xyz' to ddname
   SYSIN and read and spool the cards following from the stack to the
   dataset until %%%% with 4 blanks following is encountered.
)O OPERANDS
))FILE('ddname') - ddname to be associated with the dataset. This
                   ddname will be freed before allocation.
))DDNAME('ddname') - is a synonym for FILE keyword.
))DATASET('dsname') - optional dataset name for the dataset.  IF a
                   dsname is not specified, the file will be a
                   temporary dataset and the disposition will be NEW,
                   DELETE requardless of the dispositions specified
                   on the command line.
                   Your user dataset prefix will be used as the high
                   order index of the dsname if the dsname is not
                   fully qualified (entered within single quotes).
))DSNAME('dsname') - is a synonym for the DATASET keyword.
))NEW     -  the file specified should be created. This is the default
))OLD     -  the dataset specified, already exists.  The DATASET name
             must be specified or the disposition will be changed to
             NEW, DELETE.
))NOALLOC -  Indicates that the ddname given in the FILE keyword
             is currently allocated and should not be allocated by
             DDSTAR.  When this keyword is present only the FILE,
             EOF and BLOCK values are used.  The FILE keyword must
             be present when NOALLOC is specified.
))DELETE  -  Indicates that the NEW dataset created should not be
             cataloged and should be deleted when freed.  This is
             the default for NEW and will be ignored for OLD.
))CATLG   -  Indicates that the NEW dataset created should be
             cataloged.  If OLD is specified this will be ignored,
             and the dataset will be kept.
))UNIT('unitname') - the unitname on which to allocate a NEW dataset.
                     If the UNIT is ommitted, then SYSDA is the default.
))VOLUME('serial') - the volume serial number of the volume on which
                     to allocate a NEW dataset or the volume on which
                     an OLD dataset resides.
                     If VOLUME is ommitted, your default TSO volume
                     is used.
))BLOCK('blksize') - block size to be use for the dataset.
))SPACE('quantity','increment') - the number of blocks and increment.
))EOF('string')    - a 1 to 8 character string which DDSTAR will use
                     as an end of file indicator when reading the
                     stack.  The end of file string must begin in the
                     1st non blank position on the card. This position
                     and the next 7 are considered. the default is !EOD

./       ADD   NAME=GETINFO
)F FUNCTION- Updated: 22 Apr 82
   The GETINFO command is designed to operate ONLY within a CLIST to
   return items of interest into CLIST variables.  Currently items from
   the OS Job Control Table (JCT), certain ACF2 fields and some utility
   date formats are supported.  GETINFO is particularly useful in any
   CLIST where JCL is to be generated, as it returns valid accounting
   data and bin number into CLIST variables for later insertion in
   the JCL built by your CLIST.

             NOCOMPR

   REQUIRED - none
   OPTIONAL - all keywords listed above are optional
   DEFAULTS - COMPR (compress off trailing blanks on variables)

   Operation- the 'var' in the keywords listed above refers to a
              variable name used in the CLIST.  The variable names
              are used WITHOUT the leading '&' when mentioned as
              an operand to the keywords above.  The variables
              MUST be initialized to the proper length via a
              SET command before being used with a GETINFO command.

   Example: suppose you want to have a CLIST build a JOB for any TSO
            user and make sure the job is billed correctly.
            You could use the following skeleton CLIST for this:

        PROC .....
        /* initialize the clist variables used by GETINFO */
        SET PGMR = &STR(                    )
        SET BIN  = &STR(    )
        SET PROJ = &STR(    )
        SET SRNUM= &STR(    )
        SET JCLAS= ' '
        SET MSGC = ' '

        /* invoke GETINFO to fill in the fields            */
        GETINFO  PGM(PGMR) BIN(BIN) PROJ(PROJ) SRNUM(SRNUM) +
           JOBCLAS(JCLAS) MSGC(MSGC)

        /* invoke EDIT to build the JCL for the JOB        */
        EDIT 'NTL1.CMDPROC(DUMMY)' CNTL
        DEL *
        /* BUILD JOB CARD */
        IN //&SYSUID  JOB (&PROJ.&SRNUM,&BIN),'&PGMR',CLASS=&JCLAS,
        IN //             NOTIFY=&SYSUID,MSGCLASS=&MSGC
         ... more clist here

        SUBMIT
        END NOSAVE
   RETURN CODES-  GETINFO sets clist variable &LASTCC as follows:

                       0 - normal completion/ no errors
              X'20' = 32 - one (or more) variables were truncated: the
                           receiving CLIST variable was too short
              X'40' = 64 - one (or more) CLIST variable names were not
                           found.
              X'80' =128 - GETINFO is not running under a CLIST
                     256 - TSO Parse services error-contact TECH SVCS.

        NOTE: The return code values are addative:
              A return code of 96 =X'60' indicates at least one CLIST
              variable was truncated, and another was not found.

))LEVEL(index-level)=LVL(index-level)
          - specifies an index level in the catalog for
            which you want information listed.  This may be
            a dsname containing one embedded asterisk that is not
            the highest level qualifier.  Level is assumed to be
            fully qualified, so no quotes are necessary.
))VOLUME(volser-list)
          - Qualifies a LEVEL request with all
            or the leading characters of the volume serial numbers
            for which a listing is desired.  Only datasets
            cataloged on volumes beginning with one of the
            volume serial numbers in the 'volser-list' will

          - If used with a DSNAME request, then search of the
            catalog is bypassed, and the dataset is located
            on the volume(s) directly. (you can use this to 'find'

          - For each disk resident dataset selected by LEVEL or
            DSNAME requests, a listing of volser, recfm, lrecl, and
            blksize is included.
))USAGE
          - For each disk resident dataset selected by LEVEL or
            DSNAME requests, a listing of last used date, last modified
            date and time, userid or jobname doing the modify, and
            a usage count is included.

The PROCSCAN CLIST provides two utility services:

  1) Scanning of a OS Cataloged Procedure (PROC) for compliance to the
     Intel JCL Policy (IPP 184642) and selected parts of the Intel
     Business System Production Naming Conventions Policy (IPP 184652).

  2) Reformatting of a PROC to adhere to column alignment and relative
     ordering of JCL keywords as specified by the JCL Policy
     (IPP 18642).

Please note that PROCSCAN is NOT A JCL SYNTAX CHECKER.  It assumes that
it is scanning JCL that has PASSED a TYPRUN=SCAN without error.  It may
get very confused if you have a JCL ERROR in the PROC it is scanning.

To run PROCSCAN in batch, see entry U65 in the TECHINFO system.

Help for PROCSCAN error messages is available in TECHINFO entry U65 and
online under TSO by typing 'EXPLAIN PSNnnn' where 'PSNnnn' is the
PROCSCAN error message number.

)X SYNTAX

    PROCSCAN   lib
               OUTPUT(dsname)
               PRINT SYSOUT CLASS(A) DEST(dest)
               NOTERM
               SNAP
               OPT(options)

   Required:  lib
   Defaults:  CLASS(A) DEST(LOCAL)

Examples of use:

   PROCSCAN 'INTRO.PROCLIB' -
            OPT('FULLPDS,MASK(ARS),REFORM') -
            OUTPUT('ARS.REFORM.PROCLIB')    -
            PRINT SYSOUT DEST(RMT18)

   would request reading of all members of INTRO.PROCLIB that start with
   the characters 'ARS' in the member name and REFORMat them to comply
   with the IPPs.  Place the reformatted members into
   'ARS.REFORM.PROCLIB' (previously allocated).  The LISTINGS would be
   sent to SYSOUT=A with a DEST=RMT18 (SC4 printer).  The summary error
   listings would be displayed on the terminal.

   PROCSCAN 'INTRO.PROCLIB' -
            OPT('FULLPDS,MASK(ARS),NOTRIVIA')

   would request reading of all members of INTRO.PROCLIB that start with
   the characters 'ARS' and suppress all 'trivial' (column and comment)
   related messages (just the "real stuff" please..).  The only printout
   would be a summary error listing at the terminal.

   PROCSCAN 'PROD.NTL.PROCLIB' -
            OUTPUT('CMS.PROCLIB')
      in response to the =>ENTER MEMBER NAMES=> message you enter:

   CMSP010 NOTRIVIA
   CMSP150 TRIVIA,REFORM,NEWNAME(CMSP150A)
   /*

   would SCAN member CMSP010 in PROD.NTL.PROCLIB with NOTRIVIA
   messages.  Would SCAN member CMSP150 and reformat it into
   CMS.PROCLIB with the new member name of 'CMSP150A'.

)O OPERANDS -

))lib      - the library name you wish to scan. (REQUIRED)
))OUTPUT(dsname) - optional:  the DSNAME of the library PDS to receive
             the reformatted PROC output.  Must be pre-allocated
             before PROCSCAN is invoked.
))PRINT    - optional: requests printout of input listing and
             reformatted PROCS. (may be used with SYSOUT keyword).
))SYSOUT   - optional: used with PRINT keyword to direct listings to
             sysout for printing.
))CLASS(a) - optional: selects SYSOUT class for SYSOUT keyword
))DEST(dest)- optional: selects DEST to use for SYSOUT.
))NOTERM   - optional: suppresses summary error listings at the
             terminal.
))OPT(opts)- optional: provides processing options for the PROCSCAN
             program.  If more than 1 option is desired, enclose the
             list within single quote marks.
             (i.e. OPT('FULLPDS,MASK(ARSP1*),NOTRIVIA')   )

The following keywords are acceptable in the PARM field, or in the OPT=
field of the PROCSCAN cataloged procedure:

  NOABEND            - supress ABEND on fatal errors; default=ABEND

  FULLPDS            - process all members in the SYSLIB PDS that
                       are have member names matching the MASK keyword.

  MASK(member-mask)  - used to limit the processing while in FULLPDS
                       mode.  The <member-mask> is a 1 to 8 character
                       string.  The '*' is used as a 'wild-card' match
                       character.  The default is MASK(********), which
                       will accept any member name during FULLPDS
                       processing.
                       (e.g. use OPT('FULLPDS,MASK(ARS)') to process
                        only ARS procs.)

  INTRO              - allows use of 'INTRO.PARMLIB' and other 'INTRO.'
                       datasets within the JCL of the PROC.  Without
                       this keyword, all INTRO. datasets found will be
                       flagged as illegal datasets. Default=NOINTRO

  NOLIST             - Suppress listing of REFORMatted PROC.
  NOCOLS             - Suppress checking of column alignments
  NOCOMM             - Suppress checking for valid //* (comment) blocks.
  NOTRIVIA           - Suppress checking for both columns and comments
                       (equivalent to 'NOCOLS,NOCOMM')

  REFORM             - Requests that the PROC be reformatted to more
                       closely comply with the JCL Policy.  Requires
                       that the OUTPUT(dsname) point to a valid
                       PDS to receive the reformatted PROC.

  SEV(nn)            - Sets the severity level for a member above which
                       the REFORM process will be suppressed. Default
                       SEV(4).

  LIBDD(ddname)      - Sets the ddname to use for the reformat output.
                       Default is LIBDD(SYSUT2).

  NEW1(nnnnn)        - Sets the starting line number to be used in col
                       73-80 in the reformatted PROC.
                       Default=NEW1(10000).

  INCR(nnnnn)        - Sets the increment for line numbers to be used
                       in col 73-80 in the reformatted PROC.
                       Default=INCR(10000).

))SYSIN    (not a keyword, but input via SYSIN)

The following keywords may be used to request services for each member
specified via the SYSIN control cards.  The control card format is:

  member  options

The options specified will override those provided by the OPT() field

The Keywords are:

  NOABEND            - supress ABEND on fatal errors.

  LIST               - Request listing of REFORMatted PROC.
  NOLIST             - Suppress listing of REFORMatted PROC.

  COLS               - Request checking of column alignments.
  NOCOLS             - Suppress checking of column alignments

  COMMENT            - Request checking for valid //* (comment) blocks.

  REFORM             - Requests that the PROC be reformatted to more
                       closely comply with the JCL Policy.  Requires
                       that the OUTPUT(dsname) point to a valid PDS to
                       receive the reformatted PROC.

  NOREFORM           - Suppresses reformat of this member.

  NEWNAME(memb-name) - Specifies <memb-name> to be used to store
                       the reformatted PROC in the OUTPUT(dsname) PDS
                       Default is to use same name as in 'lib' PDS.

  LIBDD(ddname)      - Sets the ddname to use for the reformat output.
                       Default is LIBDD(SYSUT2).

  SEV(nn)            - Sets the severity level (see messages below) for

)F FUNCTION -    QUEUE cmd rel 3  (09JUL80)

 The QUEUE command provides TSO users access to JES2 datasets residing
 on the SPOOL packs, and displays information on current status of
 JES2 processing queues (execution/print/punch).

 A TSO user may examine any JES2 datasets (JCL, JES2 JOBLOG, job msgs,
 or any SYSIN or SYSOUT dataset for any JOB submitted by that TSO user.
 QUEUE may examine these datasets regardless of HOLD status for the
 dataset;  that is, a user may browse a SYSOUT=A dataset even though it
 wasn't submitted with HOLD=YES on the SYSOUT DD card.

 * * * *    W  A  R  N  I  N  G   * * * * !!!

   In order to access SYSOUT for jobs other than your own (e.g. jobs
   submitted by other TSO users or production jobs), you MUST first be
   given permission to do so by the Data Resource Administrator in MIS
   Security.   Failure to gain permission will cause ACF2 (the
   security system) to log a security violation against your TSO
   session.  After 10 violations, you will be logged off TSO.  For
   access to Production systems, the system Product Administrator must
   OK the access.

 Example of operation:
   Suppose you submitted a job NTL1234(JOB00245) and the output hasn't
   been printed yet.  You would type:

      QUEUE DD 245

   which would cause entry to QUEUE and execute 'DD 245' (display
   datasets for job 245).

   On the DD command screen you find the listing of SYSPRINT DDname for
   the job appears as:

       STEPNAME DDNAME    DSID    LINES  CLASS
       STEP040  SYSPRINT   108     2456    Q

   To view the dataset type 'L 245 108'.  then you may use the scroll
   commands '+, -, T, B, etc' to view the dataset in a full screen mode.

   The same actions as above could have been performed using:

      QUEUE DD NTL1234

      LIST NTL1234 0108


   EXAMPLE 2:  Display all the return codes for each step in a job.

***********************************************************************
 Example of operation:
   Suppose you submitted a job NTL1234(JOB00245) and the output hasn't
   been printed yet.  You would type:

      QUEUE DD 245

   which would cause entry to QUEUE and execute 'DD 245' (display
   datasets for job 245).

   On the DD command screen you find the listing of SYSPRINT DDname for
   the job appears as:

       STEPNAME DDNAME    DSID    LINES  CLASS
       STEP040  SYSPRINT   108     2456    Q

   To view the dataset type 'L 245 108'.  then you may use the scroll
   commands '+, -, T, B, etc' to view the dataset in a full screen mode.

   The same actions as above could have been performed using:

      QUEUE DD NTL1234

      LIST NTL1234 0108


   EXAMPLE 2:  Display all the return codes for each step in a job.
               Job is NTL99993(JOB00394).

./       ADD   NAME=SCRAMBLE
)F FUNCTION

  The SCRAMBLE CLIST invokes a utility processor to Encipher or
  Decipher your dataset according to the NBS standard algorithm.
  You supply a 1 to 8 alpha-numeric keyword, from which a 48 bit
  code key will be produced.  This code key is applied to each 8
  bytes (64 bits) of your dataset.  Each record in the designated
  dataset is read, en- or deciphered, and re-written in place. The
  utility can handle records of FB or VB format with an LRECL in the
  range of 8 to 256 bytes.  Note that the algorithm is designed to
  work only on multiples of 8 bytes, so if the LRECL is NOT a
  multiple of 8, then up to 7 bytes per record may be unprocessed.

  WARNING: this utility operates on the actual dataset by using the
           read-and-update-in-place technique.  If you forget the key
           that you used to encipher the dataset, KISS THE DATA GOOD-BYE
           because we have no way of deciphering the data again.

  If you are hopelessly paranoid, you can encipher the enciphered
  dataset with a different key to really grunge up the data.  The
  decipherion process must be the exact inverse of the encipher process
  in order to recover the original data again.  (see example 2)

EXAMPLES -

1) to encipher dataset 'userid.MYSTUFF.PRIVATE.DATA' with the key of
'JUNK' type:

  SCRAMBLE  MYSTUFF.PRIVATE.DATA JUNK ENCIPHER

  to get it back to clear text again, type

  SCRAMBLE  MYSTUFF.PRIVATE.DATA JUNK DECIPHER

2) to really garbage up 'userid.SUPER.PRIVATE.DATA' with keys of
   'WHATME' and 'WORRY' type:

  SCRAMBLE SUPER.PRIVATE.DATA WHATME ENCIPHER
  SCRAMBLE SUPER.PRIVATE.DATA WORRY ENCIPHER

   to decipher this mess, just reverse the order as in:

  SCRAMBLE SUPER.PRIVATE.DATA WORRY DECIPHER
  SCRAMBLE SUPER.PRIVATE.DATA WHATME DECIPHER

    WARNING:  if you do these out of order, the solution to the problem
              is not unlike Rubik's Cube after 6 good twists...

3) you were merrily processing your dataset and POOF, the system
   crashes.   Now what do you do?

   a) Examine your dataset with SPF browse, and find the last record
      number that was processed.  If all were processed, you are in
      luck and no further action is necessary.
   b) re-run the SCRAMBLE specifying the SAME KEY you used before
      and the same ENCIPHER or DECIPHER keyword, but adding a
      SKIP(nnnn) for the number of records that were already
      processed.

The TECHINFO command is used to invoke a program to allow you to do a
key-word search on items in the CIS Technical Services information
database.  This database is updated by members of PSA and Tech Services
with items of interest to Applications programming and other CIS users.
The utility provides a powerful Key Word search capability to allow
you to see only those items of interest to you.  The TECHINFO command
provides the facility to print out entries of your choice and supports
the printing on the local printers in SJ1, or a remote JES2 printer
of your choice, or a 328x printer in your location.

))PRINTER(printername) - this optional keyword overrides the normal
          SYSOUT/REMOTE specification by directing the printout from
          the retrieval program to a temporary dataset.  The DSPRINT
          program is used to send the temporary dataset to the
          VTAM Station name specified by 'printername'.  The program
          embodies a list of valid VTAM station names and will check
          for the proper name before proceeding.  If you invoke
          TECHINFO with PRINTER(Z) (or any other invalid station name)
          the clist will display a list of valid station names.
))REMOTE(destid) - if PRINTER is NOT specified, this will override
          the default JES2 destination for your printed reports from
          the inquiry program.  The default 'destid' for your TSO
          account may be viewed/changed with the SETDFLT Clist.
