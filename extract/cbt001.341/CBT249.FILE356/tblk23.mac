+BECAUSE MORE RECORDS CAN FIT ON A TRACK (LESS BLOCKS), IT STANDS
+TO REASON THERE CAN BE A HIGHER RECORD CAPACITY WITH LESS SPACE
+ALLOCATED AS SHOWN IN THE EXAMPLE ABOVE.
+
+OVER 6000 MORE RECORDS CAN FIT IN 4 CYLINDERS WITH A BLOCK SIZE
+OF 6120 THAN 10 CYLINDERS WITH A BLOCK SIZE OF 80.
+
+IT IS POSSIBLE FOR A LARGE RECORD WITH A LARGE BLOCKSIZE TO
+REQUIRE MORE SPACE WITH A BETTER BLOCK SIZE.  THIS IS THE EXCEPTION
+AND THE REASON ALL THE DATA IS GIVEN TO THE USER.  BE CAREFUL
+NOT TO TRADE OFF MORE EFFICIENT I/O FOR LESS SPACE.
