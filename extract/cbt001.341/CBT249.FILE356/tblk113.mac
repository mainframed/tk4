%TUTORIAL ----------------- RECORD  CAPACITY --------------------------T
%NEXT SELECTION ===>_OPT

     THE RECORD CAPACITY IS SHOWN FOR PRIMARY ALLOCATION OF TRACKS,
CYLINDERS OR BLOCKS SO THAT THE USER CAN INTERPRET THE MOST EFFICIENT
MEANS OF ALLOCATING SPACE.  IT IS MOST COMMOM FOR USERS TO ALLOCATE
IN TRACKS OR CYLINDERS; HOWEVER, IF SPACE IS ALLOCATED IN BLOCKS,
CONVERSION FROM 3350 TO 3380 DEVICE TYPE IS NO PROBLEM AND THE SPACE
IS USED EFFICIENTLY.

     IF SPACE IS ALLOCATED IN CYLINDERS, ONE OR TWO RECORDS MAY HAVE
CAUSED THE ALLOCATION TO EXTEND TO SECONDARY EXTENTS, WASTING THE
REMAINDER OF THE CYLINDER(S) UNTIL THE VOLUME OF RECORDS GROWS.
SIMILAR OCCURENCES HAPPEN WHEN SPACE IS ALLOCATED IN TRACKS, BUT
THE SPACE WASTED IS NOT AS GREAT.

      IT IS RECOMMENDED TO ALLOCATE IN BLOCKS.
