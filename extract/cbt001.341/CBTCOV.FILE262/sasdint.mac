Introductory explanation of SAS dates.

SAS stores dates internally as the number of days relative to
January 1, 1960, e.g. if the following SAS statements were executed -

  data;
    input ddd yymmdd8.;
    put ddd 8. ' ' ddd date7.;
    cards;
    850815

the PUT statement would print -

    9358 15AUG85

Note that if the INPUT statement were slightly altered -

    input ddd;

the PUT statement would then print -

    870815 15Jun4289
