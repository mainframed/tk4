Bar charts are suitable for item comparisons where you want to compare
how things rank; are they about the same, or is one more or less than
the others, e.g. Bob Draper sells more widgets than any other salesman.

Bar charts differ from pie charts in that the sizes aren't necessarily
proportional to percentages of the total.

As with pie charts, a general rule is to not use more than six
components.  If you have more than six, select the five most important,
and group the remainder into an "others" category.
