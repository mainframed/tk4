Renum renumbers.  Note that this has no effect on an unnumbered data
set when it is saved; the sequence numbers will still be stripped off
before the save is done.  To cause an unnumbered data set to be saved
with sequence numbers, use the num subcommand.

$until answer='1' × answer='2'
  1 - I want to specify the line number to be assigned to the
      first record, and an increment to be added to produce each
      subsequent line number.
  2 - I want to specify just an increment, which will be added to
      each line number currently associated with the data set.

  Enter a 1 or 2 to indicate your choice:
  $input
$if answer='2'
  $cmd setl l2
  $until answer^=''
    Enter the increment to be added or subtracted from each line
    number.  Do not put a sign on the number.  You will later be
    prompted to indicate whether the number should be added or
    subracted.
    $input
  $cmd setl L1 &ANSWER
  If the increment is to be added, just hit the enter key.  Otherwise,
  enter any nonblank character (except + or -, which won't work
  because TSO recognizes them as line continuation characters) and the
  increment will be subtracted.
  $input
  $if answer^=''
    $cmd setl L1 '-&L1'
  $else
    $cmd setl L1 '+&L1'
$else
  $until answer^=''
    Enter the line number that is to be associated with the first line
    in the data set:
    $input
  $cmd setl L1 &ANSWER
  $until answer^=''
    Enter the increment to be used in renumbering:
    $input
  $cmd setl L2 &ANSWER

The generated command is as follows:
  ren &L1 &L2
Do you want the command executed?  Enter a null line for yes.
$input
$if answer=''
  $cmd ren &L1 &L2
