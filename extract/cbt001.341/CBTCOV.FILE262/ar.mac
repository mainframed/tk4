AR will shift the non-blank data in each column to the specified right
margin.

You will first be prompted for the Line Specification Unit (LSU).

$cmd aid lsu

All of the data in each column doesn't have to be involved in the
adjustment.  You can optionally specify left and right margin
parameters.  If you don't, they will default to 1 and <len>,
respectively.

Enter the right margin, or a null line to take the defaults.
$input
$cmd setl rm &ANSWER
$if answer^=''
  Enter the left margin or a null line to take the default.
  $input
$cmd setl lm &ANSWER

The generated command is as follows:
$write  &LSU ar &RM &LM
Do you want the command executed?  Enter a null line for yes.
$input
$if answer=''
  $cmd &LSU ar &RM &LM
