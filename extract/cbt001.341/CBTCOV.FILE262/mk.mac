The mk subcommand is used to set elements of the mark array. This is a
9-element "memory", indexed by numbers 1 thru 9, which can be
referenced in an LSU "20000 mk 1" sets mark array element 1 to 20000,
for example.  Note that you can see a display of the current settings
of the mark array by entering the mk subcommand with no operands.  The
mark array is initialized to zero.

Do you want to see a display of the current settings of the mark
array?  Enter a null line for yes.
$input
$if answer=''
  $cmd mk
$else
  You will next be prompted first for the line number to be stored in
  the mark array.  Before that, however, you may choose to see a
  detailed explanation of how line number specifications can be made.

  $until answer='1'  × answer='2'
    1 - Give me an explanation of line number specifications before
        prompting me.
    2 - I understand about line numbers.  Go ahead and prompt me.

    Enter one of the above numbers.
    $input
  $if answer=1
    $cmd aid lsulinei

  Now enter the line number to be sotred in the mark array.  If you
  don't specify a starting line, the default will be the top line in
  the data set.

  $cmd setl l1 t
  $input
  $if answer^=''
    $cmd setl l1 &ANSWER

  $until answer>='1' && answer<='9'
    Enter the mark array element number, 1 thru 9, into which the
    line number is to be stored.
    $input
  $cmd setl no &ANSWER
  The generated subcommand is as follows:

  $write &L1 mk &NO

  Do you want the subcommand executed?  Enter a null line for yes.
  $input
  $if answer=''
    $cmd &L1 mk &NO
