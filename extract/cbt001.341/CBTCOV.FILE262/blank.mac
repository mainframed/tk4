$ start
Blank inserts a specified number of blank records into the data set
following each line specified in the LSU.  One notable exception to
this is that if the starting line number is specified as 0, then the
specified number of blanks will be inserted in front of the first
line in the data set, e.g. "0 b bl 1" applied to data set

  1 abc
  2 def
  3 ghi

will produce -

  1
  2 abc
  3
  4 def
  5
  6 ghi
  7

You will next be prompted to enter the Line Specification Unit.
Normally, the only values which are important are the <l1>, <l2>,
and <incr>.  Note however that the specified number of blanks is
inserted behind each line in the data set for each column specified.
Thus, the subcommand "..2 bl 1" would cause 2 blank lines to be
inserted following each line in the data set.

$cmd aid lsu

Now enter the number of blank lines to be inserted, or null to take the
default of 1.

$input
$cmd setl count &ANSWER
The generated command is as follows:
$write &LSU bl &COUNT
Do you want the command executed?  Enter a null line for yes.
$input
$if answer=''
  $cmd &LSU bl &COUNT
