AC will shift data so that a particular character string, if it exists
in a given column, will appear in the specified position.

You will first be prompted for the Line Specification Unit (LSU).

$cmd aid lsu

$until answer^=''
  Now enter the string to be scanned for.  At least one
  non-blank character must be entered.  Do not enter the
  string in apostrophes, even if the string contains
  apostrophes, blanks or other delimiters.

  $input

$cmd setquot str

$until answer^=''
  Enter the column to which data is to be aligned:

  $input

$cmd setl COL &ANSWER

All of the data in each column doesn't have to be involved in the
column adjustment.  You can optionally specify left and right margin
parameters.  If you don't, they will default to 1 and <len>,
respectively.

Enter the left margin, or a null line to take the defaults.
$input
$cmd setl lm &ANSWER
$if answer^=''
  Enter the right margin or a null line to take the default.
  $input
$cmd setl rm &ANSWER

The generated command is as follows:
$write  &LSU ac &STR &COL &LM &RM
Do you want the command executed?  Enter a null line for yes.
$input
$if answer=''
  $cmd &LSU ac &STR &COL &LM &RM
