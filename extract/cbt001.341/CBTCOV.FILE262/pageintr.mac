PAGEDEF - Introduction

A PAGEDEF (page definition) defines the page format that PSF (Print
Services Facility, the component which handles printing on the IBM 3800)
uses to format data into pages.  A PAGEDEF defines the size of form to
be used, the print font to be used, the print line size, and the maximum
number of lines to be printed on each page. You can see PAGEDEF
specified in many of the examples selectable from the menu previous to
this one.

NOTE:  The PAGEDEF value you use must be in harmony with other
parameters such as FORMDEF, DEVTOK, etc.  These are not yet documented
under the %ASSIST facility, but will be when I get the time.

The PAGEDEF tables available on the previous menu were extracted from
Appendix F of the PSF "User's Programming Guide for MVS" Program Number
5665-275, manual number S544-3084-0.
