Use the flip subcommand to exchange the data between two spots in the
data set.  You will be prompted for two Line Specification Units.
The data in the two matrices thus defined will be exchanged.  Note
that the two matrices don't have to have the same shape, e.g.
"1,5 1.1.10 flip 1,10 1.1.5" is perfectly legitimate, but they
can't overlap --- well, they can, but I wouldn't care to predict
what the data will look like afterwards.

Now enter the first LSU.
$cmd aid lsu
$cmd setquot from lsu
$cmd setl from &FROM

Now enter the second LSU.
$cmd aid lsu

The generated subcommand is as follows:

$write &FROM flip &LSU

Do you want the subcommand executed?  Enter a null line for yes.
$input
$if answer=''
  $cmd &FROM flip &LSU
