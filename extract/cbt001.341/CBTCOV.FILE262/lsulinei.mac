A specific line in the data set can be referred to in several
different ways, the simplest being by the line number itself, e.g.
if you want to refer to the line numbered 30,  enter "30".

There are also a number of keywords you can use in place of line
numbers -

   t - The top line in the data set.
   b - The bottom line in the data set.
   * - The current line.
   n - The current line plus one. Equivalent to *+1 (see below).
   p - The current line minus one. Equivalent to *-1 (see below).

Any of the above keywords can optionally have suffixed to it a signed
integer, e.g. t+3 refers to the fourth line in the data set
(top line, plus 3 = fourth line), and b-3 refers to the fourth line
from the bottom.

You can also use parenthesized expressions to refer to line numbers,
e.g. if symbolic variable A contains "3000" then specifying (a+30)
would refer to line number 3030.  Any operators and function references
that can be used with the CALC subcommand can also be used here.

Note that an LSU specifies both a starting line and an ending line.
If you specify a starting line higher than the ending line, with most
subcommands the lines will be processed in reverse order, e.g.
if the starting line specified is "b" for bottom, and the ending
line is "t" for top, then the lines will be processed from the
bottom up through the top.
