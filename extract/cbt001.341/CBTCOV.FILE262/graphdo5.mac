Tailoring your own memorandum page header.

If you took the opportunity to review the sample document, you saw at
the top of the page several horizontal lines, a geometric pattern, and
the words "From the desk of" followed by "Thomas Glen Smith" in bold
letters.  In X75826.MEMO.DEBUG.TEXT, which is the source for the sample
document, the line which reads ".gg 1 1 40 71 segload tomhdr" is the one
which pulls in this header information.

You can customize your own header information and store it in a
library for later inclusion in your documents with a .gg statement
similar to the one above.

Enter a null line if you would like to customize your own memorandum
header, or anything else to end this menu.
$input
$if answer^=''
  $goto eoj
$cmd clearsc
$cmd assist graphgdf
$if rc=0
  Enter the member name under which your customized header information
  is to be saved.  This is the name you will specify in the .gg
  statement in the text file for your document.  It must be eight
  characters or less in length, the first must be alphabetic, and the
  rest alphameric:
  $until length(answer)>0
    $input
  $cmd setl memnam &ANSWER

  Now enter the name you would like to appear in the header after
  the words "From the desk of:"
  $input
  $cmd %%segsave &MEMNAM cmd(tomhdr 0 name(&ANSWER)) alloc(NO)

  &MEMNAM is now stored in library ADMGDF.

$tso alloc fi(amdgdf) da('x75826.admgdf') shr reuse
