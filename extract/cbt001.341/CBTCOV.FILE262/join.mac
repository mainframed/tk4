$ start
Use join to combine one or more pairs of consecutive lines.  You
specify a Line Specification Unit (LSU) with the join subcommand,
but the only two parameters used are <l1> and <l2>; the starting
and ending lines of the range to be joined.

$cmd aid lrange

$until answer^=''
  Now enter the number of lines in each group to be joined together,
  e.g. if each pair of lines in the range are to be joined, enter 2.
  $input
$cmd setl cnt &ANSWER

The generated command is as follows:

$write &L1 &L2 join &CNT

Do you want the command executed?  Enter a null line for yes.
$input
$if answer=''
  $cmd &L1 &L2 join &CNT
