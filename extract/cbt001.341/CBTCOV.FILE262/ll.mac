Use the ll subcommand to change the length of one or more lines.  In
the simplest case, the lines are considered to contain words, and when
the lines are adjusted, words will not be divided.  Words will be
shifted from one line to another to fill out each line as close as
possible to the specified line length.

A more complicated rearrangement of words is possible, but that form
will not be discussed here.  See the ABE reference manual.

$cmd aid lrange

$until answer^=''
  Now enter the new line length.
  $input
$cmd setl cnt &ANSWER

The generated command is as follows:

$write &L1 &L2 ll &CNT

Do you want the command executed?  Enter a null line for yes.
$input
$if answer=''
  $cmd &L1 &L2 ll &CNT
