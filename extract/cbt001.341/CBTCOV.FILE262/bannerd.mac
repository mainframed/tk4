Print a banner - you specify the text size and lines per page.

The text you want printed should be stored by you in a TSO dataset.
Each line of text may begin with carriage control as follows:

  '1' - skip to a new page.
  '+' - Suppress skipping to a new line AFTER printing this line.
  ' ' - Skip to a new line AFTER printing this line.
  '0' - Skip 1 line BEFORE printing this line.
  '-' - Skip 2 lines BEFORE printing this line.

You will be prompted for both the height and width of the characters.
The precision extends only to tenths of inches; .35 is recognized
as .3 only.

You will also be prompted for a printer destination.  This MUST BE
a CITOH printer equipped with a QMS wedge box.
