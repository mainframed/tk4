CATEGORY 3:
  LOCATING, LISTING, OR CHANGING LINES CONTAINING PARTICULAR DATA:
           fab fib find findall lsp spff verify.
  The subcategories are:

1 - FINDING ONE OR MORE OCCURRENCES OF A PARTICULAR CHARACTER STRING:
         fab fib find findall spff.
2 - APPLYING OTHER SSE SUBCOMMANDS TO LINES CONTAINING PARTICULAR DATA:
         lsp.
3 - LOCATING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TWO SIMILAR DATA SETS:
         verify.

Enter the number, 1 thru 3, of the subcategory about which you want
more information:
$ans 1 t3s1
$ans 2 t3s2
$ans 3 t3s3
Only the numbers 1 thru 3 are acceptable responses.  Try again.

SUBCATEGORY 1:  FINDING ONE OR MORE OCCURRENCES OF A
                PARTICULAR CHARACTER STRING:
                fab fib find findall spff.
findall - Creates a new virtual data set containing all records
          having a particular character string.  The mb subcommand
          can later be used to merge these lines back into the
          original data set.  The search for lines containing the
          string begins with the top line on the display, and
          continues through the end of the data set.
fab     - operates identically to the findall subcommand, except that
          the search begins with the top line on the display, and
          continues backwards to the top of the data set.
find    - finds the next occurrence of a character string.
fib     - finds the previous occurrence of a character string.
spff    - Useful in finding occurrences of particular words, or
          prefixes or suffixes to words, or for locating lines
          in which a particular string does not occur.

SUBCATEGORY 2:  APPLYING OTHER SSE SUBCOMMANDS TO LINES CONTAINING
                PARTICULAR DATA: lsp.
lsp - Lsp allows you to apply a series of sse subcommands to lines
      of the data set based on selection criteria other than
      simply line-a thru line-b (e.g. every third line, lines
      containing abc beginning in column 1, etc).
$goto aidpr
$ t3s3
SUBCATEGORY 3:  LOCATING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN TWO SIMILAR DATA SETS:
                verify.
verify - Use the verify subcommand to compare all data sets currently
         on the display, beginning with the second line on the display
         for each data set.  The comparison will stop whenever a line
         in one of the data sets doesn't match the others.
