This subcommand causes the data set to be displayed in hex mode.  In
this mode, each record is displayed on two lines of the screen.  The
first line will contain the record in ebcdic, except that
unprintable characters will be translated to blanks, and a space
will be inserted after each character of the record.  This spacing
is done so that the characters will match up with their hexadecimal
representation, which is displayed on the second line.  You can
change data for the record in either line of the display, but
remember that the first line contains periods where unprintable
characters exist in the record; if you change data in this line, the
unprintable characters in the record will be replaced with the
periods from the display.  If you change data in the second line for
a record, use hexadecimal character representations (e.g.  C1 =
'a').  To return to normal display mode, enter the char subcommand.

The generated command is as follows:

  hex
