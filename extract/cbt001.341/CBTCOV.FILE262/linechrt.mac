As you are being prompted for input, remember the following definitions:

Y variable:  Values represented along the vertical axis of the plot,
e.g. TEMPERATURE in the sample previously shown.

X variable:  Values represented along the horizontal axis of the plot,
e.g. MONTH in the sample previously shown.  As you enter these values,
remember that each successive number should have a uniform difference
from its predecessor, e.g. 1 2 3 4, or 10 20 30 40.

You will next see a screen on which to enter values for the X and Y
variables.  They must be numeric.  Each time you hit ENTER, a new
empty screen will be displayed for entering values.  When you are done
entering numbers, press PF3.
