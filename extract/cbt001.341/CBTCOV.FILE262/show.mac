giving the display lines it owns to another data set which is
currently being edited, but which does not currently own any lines
on the display.

$until answer^=''
  Enter the symbolic name associated with the data set to replace
  the current data set on the display:
  $input
$cmd setl L1 &ANSWER

The generated command is as follows:

Do you want the command executed?  Enter a null line for yes.
