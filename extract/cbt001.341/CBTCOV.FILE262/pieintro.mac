Pie charts are suitable for component comparisons in which the size
of each part is proportional to the percentage of the whole, e.g.
manufacturer's share in the diaper market.

A general rule is to not use more than six components.  If you have
more than six, select the five most important, and group the remainder
into an "others" category.
