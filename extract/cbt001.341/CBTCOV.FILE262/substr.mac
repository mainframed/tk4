Use the substr subcommand to insert data into existing lines in the
data set.

$cmd aid lsu

$cmd setl decr
$cmd setl str
$cmd setl cycle
$cmd setl rnd

$until t='1' × t='2' × t='3' × t='4' × t='5' × t='6' × t='7'
  1 - Store a constant to be specified.
  2 - Store a constant currently in column 1 of an existing line.
  3 - Store a constant currently in the same column of an existing
  .   line.
  4 - Store an incrementing number.
  5 - Store a decrementing number.
  6 - Store a constant to be specified cyclically, e.g. if
  .   constant='abc', <len>=1 and <ncols>=5, then the first five
  .   columns will contain a, b, c, a, and b respectively.
  7 - Store a constant to be specified randomly, e.g. if
  .   constant='abc', <len>=1 and <ncols>=5, then the first five
  .   columns will contain a sequence randomly selected from 'abc',
  .   and the result might be a, c, b, c, and c respectively.

    $cmd setl str &ANSWER
  $when t='6'
    $cmd setl cycle cycle
    $until answer^=''
      Enter the constant to be cycled.  Don't enter it in quotes;
      The quotes will be added for you.
      $input
    $cmd setquot str answer
  $when t='7'
    $cmd setl rnd rnd
    $until answer^=''
      Enter the constant from which data is to be selected randomly.
      Don't enter it in quotes; the quotes will be added for you.
      $input
    $cmd setquot str answer

The generated command is as follows:

$write &LSU SUBSTR &STR &COL &SAMECOL &INCR &DECR &CYCLE &RND

Do you want it executed?  Enter a null line for yes.
$input
$if answer=''
  $cmd &LSU SUBSTR &STR &COL &SAMECOL &INCR &DECR &CYCLE &RND
