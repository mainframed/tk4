MERGE/BY - how it works.

The SAS MERGE statement is confusing for me, and i don't always get the
results I expect. Consider the following SAS statements and the
resulting output (If you have a local printer, you may want to print
this screen before continuing):

$cmd clearsc 1

My problem arises from the fact that, when merging, SAS treats
variables with the same name in more than one dataset differently.
I think the logic is as shown on the following page:

$cmd clearsc 1
$control asis
1. Initialize all variables in the output buffer to missing.

2. Obtain the next observation from the first dataset mentioned on the
MERGE statement, filling in the variables in the output buffer.

3. For each succeeding dataset mentioned on the MERGE statement, do:

   A. If the BY values in the next observation match those in the first
   dataset on the MERGE statement, there are matching observations, so
   obtain the next observation in the input buffer for this dataset.
   Otherwise, if the BY-values in the input buffer match the output
   buffer, retain the values already in the input buffer, else set all
   variables other than BY-variables in the input buffer to missing.

   B. For each variable which is not a BY-variable, do the following:

      a.  For each variable which isn't contained in one of the datasets
      previously mentioned on the MERGE statement, assign the value from
      the input buffer to the output buffer.

      b. For each variable which is contained in one of the datasets
      previously mentioned on the MERGE statement, if there are matching
      observations, assign the value from the input buffer to the output
      buffer.

4. Write the output buffer, and go back to step 1.
$cmd clearsc 1

I can still get the results I expected by changing my SAS statements
as follows:
