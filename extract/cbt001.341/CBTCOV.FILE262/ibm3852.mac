IBM3852 Color Jetprinter - local graphics screen copy.

If you have an IBM 3179G or 3192G graphics video display terminal, the
IBM 3852 Color Jetprinter is the device to get for color hardcopy.  You
just press the PRINT key on the terminal keyboard to get what you see
on the screen printed on the locally attached printer.  The cost
is $700, which is comparatively cheap.

The printer will produce transparencies, but you must use IBM's (part #
6293933).  Other transparencies just smear. Cost is $65 per box of 50
sheets for less than 4 boxes. Although it will print on any paper, the
colors are significantly better on IBM special paper in continuous form
(part #1669310), cutsheet (part #6293935) or roll paper (part #6293884).

An optional print buffer frees up the 3179G terminal while the printer
is doing a local print.  If you have a 3192G, the buffer is built into
the terminal. The buffer is on the PC Center authorized list, i.e. the
list of components which are already authorized:

    Microfazer II with 512K (goes up to 2M)
      with cables for IBM3179G.
      Cost is $312

The cable that must be ordered with this printer is a "Printer
Interface Cable," IBM Part #2058, $40.
