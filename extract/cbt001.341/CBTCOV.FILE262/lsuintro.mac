All ABE subcommands can be prefixed with a syntactical unit called a
Line Specification Unit (LSU), and with some subcommands (e.g. COPY
and MOVE) the syntax includes a second LSU.  An LSU is used to specify
the units of data, hereafter referred to as columns, that the
subcommand is to be applied to.

A column is a set of one or more contiguous record positions.  You can
think of an LSU as defining a 2-dimensional array or matrix of columns
over a range of lines in the data set.  For instance, the LSU "t b
1.8.5" defines a matrix of five 8-character columns beginning in
record position 1 of each line from the top-most (indicated by the
"t") to the bottom-most (indicated by the "b") line in the data set.

Each LSU specifies 6 items, commonly referred to as -

    <l1>    - Starting line in range.
    <l2>    - Ending line in range.
    <incr>  - Line increment, e.g. "2" indicates every other line.
    <off>   - Offset to first column.
    <len>   - Length of each column.
    <ncols> - Number of columns defined over each line.

Note that all the above items are optional, and may be omitted in a
given LSU.  Each omitted option takes the following default:

    <l1>    - First line in data set.
    <l2>    - Last line in data set.
    <incr>  - 1
    <off>   - 1
    <len>   - Maximum line length.
    <ncols> - 1

As previously mentioned, the syntax of some ABE subcommands include a
second LSU.  In the case of MOVE and COPY, the first LSU specifies the
columns from which data is to be copied/moved, and the second LSU
specifies the columns to which data is to be copied/moved.
