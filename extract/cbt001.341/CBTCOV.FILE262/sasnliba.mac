Creating a new permanent SAS library.

Enter the SAS library dsname to be created.  The name should conform
with standard TSO dataset name conventions:

$input
$until ok
  $cmd setl dsname &ANSWER
  $if index(answer,'''')=1
    $cmd setquot dsname dsname
    $tso xctl dsnloc &ANSWER
  $else
    $tso xctl dsnloc '&SYSPREF..&ANSWER'
  $if lastcc=0
    The name you specified, &ANSWER, already exists.  Enter a new
    name, or a null line to stop creation of a new SAS library.
    $input
    $if length(answer)=0
      $goto eoj
    $cmd setl ok 0
  $else
    $cmd setl ok 1
$* comment to terminate select

Enter the ddname or filename, e.g. if you intend to subsequently
execute a SAS DATA step like "data myfile.xyz;" then you should enter
MYFILE.

$input
$cmd setl ddname &ANSWER

Enter the number of tracks to allocate initially (primary space).
$cmd assist promptno
$cmd setl primary &NUMBER

Enter the number of tracks to get if more space is needed (secondary
space).
$cmd assist promptno
$cmd setl seconda &NUMBER
The allocate statement is -

alloc fi(&DDNAME) da(&DSNAME) new tr sp(&PRIMARY &SECONDA) reuse

Do you want it executed?  Enter a null line for yes.
$input
$if length(answer)=0
  $tso alloc fi(&DDNAME) da(&DSNAME) new tr sp(&PRIMARY &SECONDA) reuse

$cmd clearsc 1
