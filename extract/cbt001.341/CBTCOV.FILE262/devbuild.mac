UNIT/DEVTYPE information - how the cross-reference table was built.

Not all possible UNIT/DEVTYPEs are listed in the cross-reference table.
Understanding how the table was built will allow you to obtain
cross-reference information about additional UNIT/DEVTYPEs.

Suppose you are interested in the DEVTYPE value for 3400-3.  You
can obtain this information by issuing the following three commands
in succession (replace userid with your TSO userid):

DEFINE NVSAM (NAME(GENERIC.T34003) DEVT(3400-3) VOLUMES(XXXXXX))
LISTC L(userid.GENERIC) VOL
DELETE GENERIC.T34003 NOSCR

If you receive the message "IDC3009I ** VSAM CATALOG RETURN CODE IS 168
- REASON CODE IS IGG0CLEH-4" then that DEVTYPE is not defined on our
system.
