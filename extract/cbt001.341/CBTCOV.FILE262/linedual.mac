$ start
Generate a line chart with two variables using your data.

$cmd setn sorcnam LINEDUAL.TEXT
$cmd assist dsprompt
$if length(sorcnam)=0
  $goto eoj
$cmd clearsc

As you are being prompted for input, remember the following definitions:

V variable:  Values represented along the vertical axis of the plot,
e.g. NOMINAL cost of crude oil in the sample previously shown.  The
line drawn on the plot for this variable will be solid.

Y variable:  Values represented along the vertical axis of the plot,
e.g. REAL cost of crude oil in the sample previously shown.  The line
drawn on the plot for this variable will be dotted.

X variable:  Values represented along the horizontal axis of the plot,
e.g. YEAR in the sample previously shown.  As you enter these values,
remember that each successive number should have a uniform difference
from its predecessor, e.g. 1 2 3 4, or 10 20 30 40.

You will next see a screen on which to enter values for the X, Y, and V
variables.  They must be numeric.  Each time you hit ENTER, a new
empty screen will be displayed for entering values.  When you are done
entering numbers, press PF3.
