Now to enter a Line Specification Unit (LSU).

$until answer='2' × answer='3' × answer='4' × answer='5'

  1 - Give me an explanation of what an LSU is.
  2 - Give me detailed prompts for the values in the LSU.
  3 - Give me brief prompts for the values in the LSU.
  4 - Don't prompt me.  Use a blank LSU, which means using defaults
      for all LSU values.
  5 - Prompt me once; I'll enter the entire LSU.

  Enter one of the above numbers.
