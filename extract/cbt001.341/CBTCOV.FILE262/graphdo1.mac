This ASSIST facility will show you how you can create documents
containing graphic drawings.

SAS/GRAPH output can be included in your document, along with drawings
created using the Graphical Data Display Manager (GDDM) software
product we license from IBM. Simple commands like "move" and "draw" can
also be used to embellish your document.

Engineering drawings from the CADAM system can be included in a
document.  Given that you are at a terminal with graphics capability, a
subsequent menu of this ASSIST facility gives you the option to display
a sample document containing such a drawing.
