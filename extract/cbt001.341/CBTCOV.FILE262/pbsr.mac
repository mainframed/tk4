Use the PBSR subcommand to shift text to the right in one or more lines.
PBSR differs from the SR subcommand, in that, with PBSR, you specify
the starting and ending columns of the data to be shifted right
in each line, and with SR, you specify the starting and ending
columns in which data is to be shifted right.

I don't use PBSL myself (ABE author).  It was built in to satisfy
a request for a subcommand compatible with the Palm Beach editor,
FSE.
