$cmd clearsc
TSO SIZE keyword.

If you have been authorized, you can specify the amount of main storage
available to your TSO session with the SIZE keyword when you logon,
e.g. "logon x75826 size(5000)".

A default SIZE value is set up for you when your TSO userid is defined.
Authority for you to override the default, along with the range of SIZE
values you may specify is also established at that time.

Some TSO facilities may require larger amounts of memory than you have
available.  SAS/GRAPH (Trademark of SAS Institute) for example will
generally not run successfully with any size value less than 5000.  You
may have to contact whoever set up your userid to obtain authorization
to use such a value.

Your current size value is as follows:

$tso size

$cmd clearsc 1
