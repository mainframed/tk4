You will next be prompted first for the starting line and then the
ending line of the range of lines to be processed.  Before that,
however, you may choose to see a detailed explanation of how line
number specifications can be made.

$until answer='1'  × answer='2'
  1 - Give me an explanation of line number specifications before
      prompting me.
  2 - I understand about line numbers.  Go ahead and prompt me.

  Enter one of the above numbers.
  $input
$if answer=1
  $cmd aid lsulinei

You will next be prompted for the starting line in the range to be
processed, <l1>.  If you don't specify a starting line, the default
will be the top line in the data set.

$cmd setl l1 t
$input
$if answer^=''
  $cmd setl l1 &ANSWER

You will next be prompted to the ending line in the range to be
processed, <l2>.  If you don't specify an ending line, the default
will be the bottom line in the data set.

$cmd setl l2 b
$input
$if answer^=''
  $cmd setl l2 &ANSWER

You will next be prompted for the line increment, <incr>.  If you
specify 2, for example, then every other line in the specified range
will be processed.  If you don't specify a line increment, the
default will be 1.

$input
$if answer=''
  $cmd setl incr 1
$else
  $cmd setl incr &ANSWER
