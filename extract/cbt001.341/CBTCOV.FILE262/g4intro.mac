Displaying multiple graphs at the same time is accomplished by using
PROC GREPLAY and TEMPLATES, which are simply definitions of rectangular
areas on the display in which separate graphs are to be displayed.
TEMPLATES may be user-defined, but several are provided by SAS
Institute.  Page 386 of the SAS/GRAPH User's Manual, Version 5 Edition,
contains the templates provided by SAS Institute.

Page 355 in the same manual, under the heading "Example: Using the
Template Facility in Full-Screen Mode" for a detailed description
of templates, and how you can define your own.
