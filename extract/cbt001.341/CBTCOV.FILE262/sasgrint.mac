Downloading to a PC pen plotter.

In order to print SAS/GRAPH output on the pen plotter attached to your
PC, you need the following things:

  1.  An IBM 7371 or 7340 pen plotter attached to your PC.
  2.  An IRMA board or its equivalent in your PC.  This lets the PC
      emulate a terminal to the main computer so you can logon to TSO.
  3.  The VIA software available from the Kimberly-Clark PC Center.
      This allows you to transfer files to and from floppy disks on
      your PC and files on the main computer.

The process involves the following steps:

  1.  LOGON to TSO and execute a set of SAS statements producing
      SAS/GRAPH output.  The menu prior to this one gives you the
      option of listing a sample set of statements.
  2.  Run VIA to download both a BASIC program (See the sample program
      mentioned in step 1) and the SAS/GRAPH output to a diskette on
      the PC.
  3.  Run the BASIC program on the PC to read the SAS/GRAPH output
      from diskette and drive the plotter.
