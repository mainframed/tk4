GPLOT - plotting by a third variable.

Given the following SAS statements -

data; input x y z; cards;
  1 1 1
  2 2 2
  3 3 3
symbol1 v=square  ;
symbol2 v=diamond ;
symbol3 v=triangle;
proc gplot;
  plot x*y=z;

You might expect a square, diamond, and triangle to be plotted
respectively representing the three points (1,1), (2,2), and (3,3).
What you actually get is three squares, one at each point, and on the
IBM3179G they will be colored blue, red, and pink, respectively.

The unexpected results are due to an idiosyncrasy of SAS/GRAPH which
can be resolved by always specifying colors on every SYMBOL statement,
EVEN IF YOU'RE USING A BLACK-AND-WHITE DEVICE SUCH AS THE 3800.
In this case the colors don't even have to be different.  If the SYMBOL
statements previously shown are altered as follows, then a square,
diamond, and triangle are printed as expected:

symbol1 v=square   c=red;
symbol2 v=diamond  c=red;
symbol3 v=triangle c=red;
