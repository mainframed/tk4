  The subcategories are:

1 - CHANGING DATA:
         change spfc ol substr ol translat.
2 - ELIMINATING DATA:
         clear delete mdel.
3 - MANIPULATING SEQUENCE NUMBERS:
         renum reseq seq unnum.

Enter the number, 1 thru 3, of the subcategory about which you want
more information:
$cmd setl answer &INPUT
$select
  $when answer='1'
    $goto t2s1
  $when answer='2'
    $goto t2s2
  $when answer='3'
    $goto t2s3
  $otherwise
    Only the numbers 1 thru 3 are acceptable responses.  Try again.

$ t2s1
SUBCATEGORY 1:  CHANGING DATA:
                change spfc ol substr ol translat.
change   - Changes all occurrences of a particular character string.
           A range of lines and a set of columns can be specified.
spfc     - Changes occurrences of a particular character string.  It
           is not as flexible in limiting the change to a particular
           range of lines, but provides more flexibility in which
           occurrences are to be changed (e.g. change only occurrences
           which are prefixes to other words).
substr   - Used to store or copy constant data in a range of records.
ol       - used to overlay data from one set of lines over data in
           another set of lines.
translat - Used to replace unprintable characters in the data set
           with periods.
$goto aidpr

$ t2s2
SUBCATEGORY 2:  ELIMINATING DATA:
                clear delete mdel.
delete - deletes lines from the data set.
mdel   - generates a delete subcommand using the memory aid called the
         mark array.  See also the mk subcommand, which is used to
         store numbers in the mark array.
clear  - truncate lines at a particular column.
$goto aidpr

$ t2s3
SUBCATEGORY 3:  MANIPULATING SEQUENCE NUMBERS:
                renum reseq seq unnum.
renum - Renumbers the data set.  You may specify the starting sequence
        number and increment.
reseq - Renumbers the data set.  You tell where the new sequence numbers
        that are to be used in renumbering are stored in each data line.
seq   - Makes the current line numbers available as part of the data
        for editing.  This might be useful if you want to temporarily
        sort the data set into a different sequence.
$goto aidpr

$ aidpr

Enter the name of the subcommand you would like more information about,
or enter a null line to end the aid subcommand.
