If you want to skip the initial explanation of how the LSP subcommand
works, and go directly to generating the subcommand, enter a null
line.  Otherwise, enter any nonblank character.
$ans '' dosyn

The lsp command can be used to apply any other sse subcommand
or subcommands to a range of lines selected via more
sophisticated criteria other than simply line-a thru line-b.

You will be prompted for a series of up to nine line range
specifications.  The first line range specification
will be associated with symbolic name &1, the second with &2, etc.
A line range specification indicates a sequence of lines in the
edited data set.  For example, a line range specification might
indicate the sequence including lines numbered 10, 50, 30, followed
by all lines in the data set with the characters "abc" beginning
in column 10, and the characters "xyz" anywhere in columns 30
thru 50.

You will first be prompted for a series of sse subcommands to be
executed for each line selected.  This series of subcommands is
called the subcommand template, and indicates the series of
subcommands to be applied to each line selected from the data set.
The process goes as follows:
Suppose you specified three line range specifications;  The LSP
subcommand will select the first line indicated by each line
range specification, and will then execute the series of sse
subcommands you specified.  When you specify the subcommands,
enter the symbol &1 wherever you want substituted the line number
for the line selected via your first line range specification,
&2 for the line from the second line range specification, etc.
This process is repeated with the second and subsequent lines
from each line range specification until all line ranges have
been completely processed at least once.  If one of the line ranges
is shorter than the others, selection restarts at the beginning
of that line range.

Note that in addition to the symbolic variables &1, &2, etc.,
indicated in the prior paragraph, there are also variables of
the form &L1, &L2, etc., and &N1, &N2, etc., that you can use
in the subcommand template.  These symbolic variables respectively
reference the prior and subsequent line in the data set in
contiguous sequence to the selected line.  For example, if the
data set is numbered incremented by 10, and line 50 is the
currently selected line number, &L1 will be set to line number
40, and &N1 will be set to line number 60.

$ dosyn
Enter the next sse subcommand to be executed for each line selected,
or enter a null line if you don't want to enter any more subcommands:
$ans '' dolrs
$setl CMD &CMD@&ANSWER
$goto dosyn

Now you will be prompted for the line range specification to be
associated with variable &1.

The final selection you must make is whether the selection of
lines and application of subcommands is to be done in a top-down
or bottom-up fashion.  That is, whether the LSP subcommand is to
begin at the top of the data set and work towards the bottom,
or vice versa.  Enter a null line to start at the top, or any
nonblank character to start at the bottom:
$ans '' dodocmd
$setl TOPK

The generated lsp subcommand is as follows:

 lsp &CMD &LSPEC

do you want it executed?  Answer n for no.
$ans n end
