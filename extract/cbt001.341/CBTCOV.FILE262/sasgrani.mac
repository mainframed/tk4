Viewing SAS/GRAPH output at a non-graphics terminal.

Turnaround for graphic output from the IBM 3800 laser printer at the
Telecommunications Center in Neenah may be a half day or longer.  You
can save time by previewing your output at a video display terminal,
confirming it is correct before sending it to the IBM 3800. This can be
done, even if your terminal doesn't have graphic capability, using a
command called %SASGRAPH, e.g. -

%sasgraph sas.cards(cowboy)

where sas.cards(cowboy) is a partitioned dataset member containing -

$tso l 'x75826.sas.cards(cowboy)' nof

$cmd clearsc 1

$cmd assist sasincl

When the graphic output from %SASGRAPH is represented on your
non-graphics terminal, each character location on the screen represents
pixels in the graphic output.  A pixel is a dot which may be either
black or white in the final drawing.  If you've ever looked at
newsprint with a magnifying glass, you will have seen an array of
pixels.

The number of pixels per character on the screen changes as you zoom in
or out.  A rule up the left side and across the top of the screen gives
you the current scale and pixel locations.

You zoom in and out, and wander about the drawing using program function
keys.  The following information will be listed at your terminal
whenever you enter the word "help" on the command line:

 PFK  1 - ZOOM IN
 PFK  2 - ZOOM OUT
 PFK  3 - END
 PFK  4 - NOT USED
 PFK  5 - LEFT MAX
 PFK  6 - RIGHT MAX
 PFK  7 - UP
 PFK  8 - DOWN
 PFK  9 - TOP
 PFK 10 - LEFT
 PFK 11 - RIGHT
 PFK 12 - BOTTOM
