There are two subcommands, MOVE and COPY, that you can use to
move/copy data.  The syntax of the two subcommands is identical, and
the only functional difference is that, once the data has been copied
to the specified destination, MOVE will eliminate the original data
and COPY will not.

When using MOVE/COPY, it helps to imagine that you are specifying two
data matrices, or boxes; a from-box and a to-box.  For a given box,
each line in the line range you specify contains a row of the matrix,
although each row does not necessary consist of the entire line, and
doesn't have to start in record position 1. Each row will contain one
or more columns, and a column consists of one or more contiguous
record positions in the line.  Data is then move/copied from the
from-box to the to-box.

Note that the from-box and the to-box don't have to be of the same
shape.  That is, the from-box might be 3 rows by 5 columns, and the
to-box may be 15 by 10.  If you know the APL programming language,
you will recognize the function as being very similar to the RESHAPE
primitive, rho.

It was mentioned above that MOVE will eliminate the original data.
If the rows in the from-box encompass the entire line, then the
original lines will be deleted.  If the rows encompass only a part
of the data in the lines, then the original data will simply be
blanked out, and the entire line will NOT be deleted.
