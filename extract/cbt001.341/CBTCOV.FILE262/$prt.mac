The $PRT subcommand is designed to simplify printing the currently
edited data set on a hardcopy printer.

The first thing you must decide is the sysout class which is to be
assigned to the printout.  Sysout classes are one-character
designations which determine the format in which the data set will be
printed.  Sysout class a, for example, is the commonest class chosen,
and indicates that printing is to be done on paper with the horizontal
bars as background.  This provides a ready reference when reading
across each print line.  If you didn't the paper to have horizontal
lines as a background, you would specify sysout class f.

Enter the sysout class in which you want the data set printed, or
enter a null line if you want the default sysout class (which is class
a):

$input
$if answer=''
  $cmd setl sysout
$else
  $cmd setl sysout sysout(&ANSWER)

$ cc
The next item that must be determined is whether or not the data to be
printed has carriage control in column 1 or not.  Carriage control is
a series of one-character codes that tell the system what kind of
spacing to use when printing your data.  With the ASA system of
carriage control, for example, a "1" in column 1 of a print line
indicates that that line is to printed at the top of a new page.  A
"0" in column 1 means double space before printing that line, and a
"-" means triple space.  The control characters are of course stripped
from column 1 before each line is printed.

Generally, if you are editing the sysout from a batch job (see also
the submit subcommand), you can assume that ASA carriage control is
present, although sometimes Machine carriage control is used.

$until answer='1' × answer='2' × answer='3'

  1 - ASA carriage control
  2 - machine carriage control
  3 - no carriage control

  Enter one of the above three numbers.
  $input

$select
  $when answer='1'
    $cmd setl cc
  $when answer='2'
    $cmd setl cc cc(m)
  $when answer='3'
    $cmd setl cc nocc

Next, you must decide where you want your data set printed. The
various printers around the company are designated REMOTE01, REMOTE02,
etc (abbreviated R01, R02, etc). At the time of this writing, the
printer in the basement of the KCWEST office building is designated
REMOTE36, and the printer in the KCNORTH office building is designated
REMOTE15.  The printer at the Telecommunications Center is
inconsistently designated LOCAL.

Enter the JES remote location where you want the job printed (e.g.
r15), or enter a null line if you want it printed on the local 3800
printer (local).

$input
$if answer=''
  $cmd setl dest
$else
  $cmd setl dest dest(&ANSWER)

Do you want the sysout to be held on the output queue?  In this case,
the data set will not be printed until you later enter a TSO OUTPUT
command.  You might want to do this if the TSO OUTPUT command has an
option you want to use that is not directly available through $prt.
Enter a null line for yes.

$input
$if answer=''
  $cmd setl hold hold
$else
  $cmd setl hold

Do you want sequence numbers to be printed at the left of each line?
Enter a null line for yes.

$input
$if answer=''
  $cmd setl seq seq
$else
  $cmd setl seq

The generated command is as follows:
$write $prt &SYSOUT &CC &DEST &HOLD &SEQ
Do you want the command executed?  Enter a null line for yes.
$input
$if answer=''
  $cmd $prt &SYSOUT &CC &DEST &HOLD &SEQ
