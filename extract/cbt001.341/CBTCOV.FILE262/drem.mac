Drem can be used to copy a range of lines from the data set owning
this command line to another data set currently being edited. You
will next be asked to enter the symbolic name associated with a data
set currently being edited.  This symbolic name will have been
assigned to the data set through one of the subcommands dent, name,
or define. The range of lines will be copied to this data set with
the specified symbolic name. If none of the currently edited data
sets have the specified symbolic name, a new virtual data set will
be created:

$until answer^=''
  Now enter the symbolic name to which the lines are to be copied:

  $input
$cmd setl name &ANSWER
$until answer^=''
  Enter the first line in the range of lines to be copied.
  $input
$cmd setl l1 &ANSWER
$until answer^=''
  Enter the last line in the range of lines to be copied.
  $input
$cmd setl l2 &ANSWER
$until answer^=''
  Enter the line in the data set being copied to behind which the
  specified lines are to be copied.  If you want the lines copied to
  the front of the data set, or if the data set does not currently
  exist, specify 0:
  $input
$cmd setl l3 &ANSWER
The command generated is as follows:
 drem &NAME &L1 &L2 &L3
Do you want it executed?  Enter a null line for yes.
$input
$if answer=''
  $cmd drem &NAME &L1 &L2 &L3
