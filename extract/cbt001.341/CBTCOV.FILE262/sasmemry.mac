If you received a message from SAS during the above processing to the
effect that there wasn't enough memory, you may still be able to see the
display by exiting the %ASSIST facility, and entering the following
command from READY mode:

  %sas da(&SORCNAM)

At any rate, you may be interested in browsing the statements in
&SORCNAM.  You can modify title statements, data, etc., and then
retry the display by entering the above %sas command from READY mode.
