Use the reseq subcommand to resequence the data set according to line
numbers which are stored as data in the records. Note that no validity
check is done, so if the data field you specify does not contain
proper sequence numbers in ascending collating sequence, the data set
will end up out of sequence.

$until answer^=''
  Enter the beginning column where the line number data is stored
  in each record:
  $input
$cmd setl L1 &ANSWER
$if answer='1'
  Do you want the stored line numbers eliminated from each record?
  In other words, do you want the other data in each record shifted
  to the left after the line number has been extracted?
  Enter a null line for yes.
  $input
  $cmd setl l1 0
$until answer^=''
  Enter the number of columns containing the stored line numbers:
  $input
$cmd setl L2 &ANSWER
The generated command is as follows:
  reseq &L1 &L2
Do you want the command executed?  Enter a null line for yes.
$input
$if answer=''
  $cmd reseq &L1 &L2
