How the text for your document is stored.

Text for a sample document containing graphics is stored in
X75826.MEMO.TEXT(DEBUG).  Here is a listing of that dataset:

$cmd clearsc 1

$tso l 'x75826.memo.text(debug)' nof non

$cmd clearsc 1

1.  Such datasets should contain fixed-length, 80-character records.
    You can create a new text dataset like this one with ABE, e.g.
    "abe memo.newdata.text".

1.  Carriage control must be stored in position 1 of each record,
    and the first line of the dataset must have "1" in position 1:

    1 - Define a new page.
    0 - Double space.
    - - Triple space.
    + - Overlay this line over the previous one (good for underlines).
      - A blank in record position 1 means single space.

2.  Graphic drawings are stored in a separate library.  They are
    included in the document with special control statements which
    must begin in record position 1, and are of the format:

    .GG line_1 column_1 line_2 column_2 SEGLOAD name

    where the line and column numbers define the diagonal corners of the
    rectangular area on the page where the graphic drawing is to be
    located, and "name" is the library member name of the graphic
    drawing.  On the menu previous to this one, the option titled "How
    the graphic drawings for your document are created and saved" will
    tell you more about this library.
