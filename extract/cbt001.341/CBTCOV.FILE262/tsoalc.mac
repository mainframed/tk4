ALLOCATING a new dataset on the same volume as an existing dataset.

When allocating a new dataset, you can use the LIKE keyword to specify
many attributes of the new dataset to be the same as an existing
dataset, e.g. "alloc da(my.new.data) like(my.old.data)".  Space
quantities, including directory space for a pds, and others values such
as DSORG, RECFM, LRECL, and BLKSIZE are all values obtained using the
LIKE keyword.

But if you want the new dataset to be allocated on the same volume as an
existing dataset, the LIKE keyword doesn't help.  In this case, you can
use the VOLSER subcommand of ABE to accomplish the task, as in the
following sample clist:

PROC 2 NEWDSN LIKEDSN
ABE '' INP(/VOLSER &&LIKEDSN/END) HARDCOPY CLIST
ALLOC DA(&&NEWDSN) NEW LIKE(&&LIKEDSN) VOL(&&VOLSER)

You can obtain more information on the VOLSER subcommand of ABE by
entering the following ABE command from READY mode:

abe '' inp(help volser)

You can return to READY mode after entering the above ABE command by
pressing PF3 twice.
