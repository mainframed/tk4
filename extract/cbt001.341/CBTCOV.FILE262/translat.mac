Translat can be used to translate all unprintable characters in
all records to periods.  This subcommand may be necessary when
displaying a data set containing characters which will be
recognized by the 3270 display terminal as terminal commands.
For example, attempting to display a record containing a
set-buffer-address command with an invalid buffer address will
cause an error to be signalled which will cause you to be
logged off.

The generated command appears as follows:
  translat
