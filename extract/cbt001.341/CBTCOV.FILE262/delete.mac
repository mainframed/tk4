The delete subcommand deletes records from the data set.

$until answer='1' × answer='2' × answer='3'
  1 - I wish to delete lines regardless of their content.
  2 - I wish to delete only lines that contain a particular string.
  3 - I wish to delete only lines that DON'T contain a particular
      string.

  Enter one of the above 3 numbers.

  $input

$cmd setl type &ANSWER
$if type='3'
  $cmd setl not not
$else
  $cmd setl not
$if type='1'
  $cmd setl str
$else
  Enter the string to be checked for to determine whether a given
  line is to be deleted.  Note that when you are prompted for the
  Line Specification Unit (LSU) below, you can use the <off> and
  <len> parameters to limit the scan for the string to a certain
  part of each record.  When you enter the string, don't surround
  it in quotes; I'll take care of it for you.

  $input
  $cmd setquot str

$cmd aid lsubrief

The generated subcommand is as follows:

$write &LSU del &STR &NOT

Do you want it executed?  Enter a null line for yes.
$input
$if answer=''
  $cmd &LSU del &STR &NOT
