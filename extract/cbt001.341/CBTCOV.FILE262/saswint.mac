The method for calculating work days, i.e. not Saturdays or Sundays or
Kimberly-Clark holidays, involves using a table of holiday dates
stored in SYS2.SAS.SOURCE(HOLIDAYS).  The sample source program in
SYS2.SAS.SOURCE(WORKDATE) uses the %INCLUDE statement to include
HOLIDAYS.  The sample program checks each date between a specified
set of starting and ending dates, and accumulates the number of
working days.
