$cmd clearsc
IBM3179G colors.

The keyboard on the IBM3179G lists RED, PINK, GREEN, YELLOW, BLUE,
TURQ, and WHITE as the available colors, and specifying C=RED in
a SAS/GRAPH SYMBOL statement works ok.  In fact, all the colors
listed on the keyboard except TURQ can be specified in SAS/GRAPH
statements.  Instead of TURQ, use CYAN.
