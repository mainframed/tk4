Use the PBSL subcommand to shift text to the left in one or more lines.
PBSL differs from the SL subcommand, in that, with PBSL, you specify
the starting and ending columns of the data to be shifted left
in each line, and with SL, you specify the starting and ending
columns in which data is to be shifted left.

I don't use PBSL myself (ABE author).  It was built in to satisfy
a request for a subcommand compatible with the Palm Beach editor,
FSE.
