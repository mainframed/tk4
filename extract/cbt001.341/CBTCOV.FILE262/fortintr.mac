We have two flavors of FORTRAN on our system:

1. FORTRAN H-Extended.  This is an older version of FORTRAN that is
kept around because some software packages we license require it, e.g.
CADAM.  Also, subroutines written FORTRAN called from PL/I must be
compiled using this compiler.

2. VS FORTRAN.  This is the preferred compiler, and eventually will
hopefully be the only FORTRAN compiler on our system.
