Use the mb subcommand to merge back lines copied via e.g. the
find subcommand using the ALL keyword.

Note that the position of the data sets on the display is critical.
The MB command should be entered on the command line of the original
data set, and the temporary data set containing the copied lines must
own the display lines just below those owned by the original data set.

The command syntax is as follows:
 mb
Do you want it executed?  Enter a null line for yes.
$input
$if answer=''
  $cmd mb
