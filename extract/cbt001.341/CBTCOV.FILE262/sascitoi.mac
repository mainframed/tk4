Printing SAS/GRAPH output on a CITOH printer.

You can print SAS/GRAPH output on a CITOH printer by using a
command called %SASGRAPH, e.g. -

%sasgraph sas.cards(cowboy) dest(tcd4)

where sas.cards(cowboy) is a partitioned dataset member containing -

$tso l 'x75826.sas.cards(cowboy)' nof

TCD4 is the VTAM node designation of the CITOH printer where printing
is to take place.  The printer must be equipped with a graphics board.
If it isn't, a lot of gibberish will print instead of your graph.
