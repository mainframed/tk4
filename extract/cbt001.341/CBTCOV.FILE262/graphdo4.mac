How the graphic drawings for your document are created and saved.

Including SAS/GRAPH output in your document is simple to do, and that
process is all that will be shown here. CADAM engineering drawings can
also be included, for example, but it isn't as easy.

Getting SAS/GRAPH output in a document is a three-step process:

1.  Prepare a set of SAS/GRAPH statements (e.g. GCHART, GPLOT, etc.),
stored in a separate sequential dataset or partitioned dataset member,
which produce a graphic drawing on a graphic terminal when SAS is
invoked.  ONLY A SINGLE DRAWING SHOULD BE PRODUCED, e.g. using the BY
statement with GPLOT to produce multiple plots in a single run is not
allowed.

2.  Once you have a set of SAS/GRAPH statements which produce a single
drawing as output, you need to invoke the %GDDMSASR command.  It will
invoke SAS to process your statements, and then use the output to create
a member of a partitioned dataset or library.  The drawing will later be
included in your document from this library.  Syntax for invoking
%GDDMSASR from READY mode is as follows:

        %GDDMSASR dsname member

where -

DSNAME is the name of the dataset containing your SAS/GRAPH statements.

MEMBER is the member name to be used when the SAS/GRAPH output is stored
in the ADMGDF library.  If you don't have such a library, the %GDDMSASR
command will allocate one for you.

You must invoke %GDDMSASR once for each drawing you intend to include in
your document, specifying a different member name for each drawing.

3.  Once all your drawings are saved in the ADMGDF library, you specify
their inclusion in your document with .gg statements. The option titled
"How the text for your document is stored" on the menu previous to this
will tell you more about the format of .gg statements.
