The $cc subcommand is designed for use when editing the msgclass
sysout for a batch job.  It will cause all lines from the msgclass
sysout except the lines indicating whether each step executed
successfully or not to be suppressed from the display.  Thus, you can
quickly scan to see which steps ran successfully, and which did not.
The command syntax is as follows:

$write $cc

do you want it executed?  Enter a null line for yes.

$input
$if answer=''
  $cmd $cc
