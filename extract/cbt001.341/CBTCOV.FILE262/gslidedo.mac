Presentation Graphics - generate a sample display using your data and
PROC GSLIDE.

The in-house editor ABE will now be invoked with an empty dataset into
which you can key the lines of text you want displayed.  When you've
finished entering text, just enter the subcommand SE on the command
line (SE tells ABE to first Save the current dataset to disk, and then
End editing).

$tso alloc fi(text) new tr sp(1 1) lr(80) bl(80) recfm(f) reuse
$tso abe '' outfi(text) lo
$cmd xt '%sas da(''''''x75826.sas.cards(gslide)'''''') +
  opt(''source source2'')'

If you received a message from SAS during the above processing to
the effect that there wasn't enough memory to process, you may still
be able to see the display by exiting the %ASSIST facility, and
entering the following command from READY mode:

  %sas da('''x75826.sas.cards(gslide)''') options('source source2')

$cmd clearsc 1
