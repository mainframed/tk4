returned to the invoking program level that accepts system
commands, if this is the only data set on display.  If the dent
subcommand has previously been issued to display additional
data sets, and end subcommands have not been entered for all of
them, the display lines owned by this data set will be
inherited by the next higher data set on the display, or the
next lower if this is the top data set, and editing for this
data set alone will be ended.
Do you want the data set saved before ending?  Enter n for no.
