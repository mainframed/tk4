$cmd clearsc
tso t command - dynamic steplib.

Use the T command to execute a tso command processor which is not stored
in one of the link list libraries (e.g. sys1.linklib or sys1.cmdlib).
The T command effectively allows you to establish a temporary steplib.

Note that if you issue the command "help t" from READY mode, you will
receive help text for the TEST command.  Apparently, T is an alias for
TEST, and the help text for IBM commands takes precedence over help
text for user-written commands.

The syntax for the T command is as follows:

T CMD OPERANDS
or
T DSN(CMD) OPERANDS
or
T (CMD FILE()) OPERANDS
or
T (CMD DATASET()) OPERANDS

1 - CMD
2 - DSN
3 - FILE
4 - OPERANDS
5 - EXAMPLES

Enter a number from 1 thru 5, or a null line to terminate this menu:
$cmd setl answer &INPUT
$cmd clearsc
$select
  $when answer=''
    $goto eoj
  $when answer='1'
    CMD - Specified the command name to be invoked.
  $when answer='2'
    DSN - specifies the data set name for the load library to be
    established as a steplib during execution of the command. if the
    specified command is in this library, that copy will be invoked.
    Otherwise, the linklst libraries will be searched. tso standard
    nameing conventions should be used.  That is, if the name is not
    prefixed with your userid, the name should be surrounded in
    aprostophes.
  $when answer='3'
    FILE - specifies the file name under which a load library, or
    several concatenated load libraries, are allocated. this file name
    will be used to establish a steplib during execution of the command.
    if the specified command is in this library or libraries, that copy
    will be invoked. Otherwise, the linklst libraries will be searched.
    Note that if neither DSN nor FILE is specified, the command will
    assume a default file name of SYSLOAD.
  $when answer='4'
    OPERANDS - This is a list of one or more operands to be passed on to
    the command to be invoked.
  $when answer='5'
    EXAMPLES -
    1) If MINE is a load module in library TEST.LOAD, the following
       will invoke MINE as a TSO command with the the operands
       "lastjcl.cntl top":

         t test.load(mine) lastjcl.cntl top

    2) If MINE is a load module in library TEST.LOAD, and MINE will
       dynamically invoke load modules stored in SUBRTNE.LOAD, the
       following sequence of commands will work:

         alloc fi(sysload) da(test.load subrtne.load) shr reuse
         t mine

    3) The following is an equivalent way of doing example 2 above:

         alloc fi(mylib) da(test.load subrtne.load) shr reuse
         t (mine fi(mylib))

    4) BIGIDLE is a user-written TSO command which will accept
       commands and execute them just as though you were in READY
       mode.  By default, you are prompted with YES_MASTER, instead
       of READY.  BIGIDLE will terminate itself when you enter the
       sequence "end idle".  The following sequence would define
       load library TEST.LOAD as a steplib until BIGIDLE is terminated:

         alloc fi(sysload) da(test.load) shr reuse
         t bigidle
  $otherwise
    Only 1 thru 5 or a null line are acceptable responses.
