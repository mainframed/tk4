Displaying a sample document at your terminal.

If your terminal has graphics capability, you can preview a document
containing graphics at your terminal before it is printed on the IBM
3800 laser printer.  Using the cursor and program function (PF) keys,
you can move about and zoom in and out.

$cmd assist graphtst

$if ^graphic
  $goto eoj
$if sampdis
  There is a problem which prevents the sample document from being
  displayed twice in the same ASSIST session.  Return to READY and
  re-enter %ASSIST if you want to see the sample document again.
  $cmd clearsc 1
  $goto eoj
$cmd setl sampdis 1

Enter a null line if you would like to see a sample document, or
anything else to end this menu.
$cmd setl answer &INPUT
$if answer^=''
  $goto eoj

Each line of the text source file will be printed at the terminal
as the document is being prepared for display.

Remember two things when the sample document is displayed:

1.  PF 3 or 4 will end displaying the document.
2.  PF 5 will give you a list of what the other PF keys do.
