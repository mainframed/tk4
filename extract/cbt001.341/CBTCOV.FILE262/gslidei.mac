The two commonest mistakes made in preparing overhead transparencies
are:

1.  Too much text on one transparency; KEEP IT SIMPLE.

2.  No one beyond the first row in the audience can read the text
without binoculars;  USE BIG LETTERS.

This assist feature shows you how to use PROC GSLIDE to make simple
displays of text with enlarged characters.  If you have a 3179G or
3192G display terminal with a 3852 Color Jetprinter attached, you can
then easily make transparencies simply by putting the transparency
blank in the printer and then pressing the PRINT key on your keyboard.
