How to convert SAS variables containing yymmdd dates to SAS dates.

If you input date information,  and indicate to SAS they are dates by
using an informat such as "yymmdd8."  SAS will convert such dates to the
number of days relative to January 1, 1960 for storing in the SAS data
library.  This is usually the best way to store dates using SAS because
it simplifies date arithmetic, e.g. -

$cmd clearsc 1
  data;
    input @ 3 start yymmdd8. stop yymmdd8.;
    fstart=start; fstop=stop;
    format fstart fstop date7.;
    elapsed=stop-start;
    cards;
    850815 870301
  proc print;

would produce the listing -

                           SAS

  OBS    START    STOP    FSTART      FSTOP     ELAPSED

   1     9358     9921    15AUG85    01MAR87      563

$cmd clearsc 1
Consider the work you would have to go through to figure the elapsed
days if the dates were truly stored as the numbers 870815 and 870301.

You may encounter some SAS datasets in which dates are not stored in
internal SAS date format, but instead are in the form e.g. yymmdd.
You can convert such dates to SAS dates in several ways, two of
which are demonstrated as follows:

$cmd clearsc 1
data;
  input in;
  date1=input(put(in,6.),yymmdd8.);
  date2=mdy(int(mod(in,10000)/100),mod(in,100),int(in/10000));
  format date1 date2 date7.;
  date3=date1;
  date4=date2;
  cards;
  870828
  871231
proc print;
  var in date1 date3 date2 date4;

The resulting listing would be:

                                   SAS

          OBS      IN       DATE1     DATE3     DATE2     DATE4

           1     870828    28AUG87    10101    28AUG87    10101
           2     871231    31DEC87    10226    31DEC87    10226

$cmd clearsc 1
