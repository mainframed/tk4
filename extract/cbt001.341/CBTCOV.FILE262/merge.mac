Merge causes all or part of a specified data set to be merged
with the data set being edited.  Only the data set being edited
is altered.

Is the data set from which lines are to be copied a numbered data set?
Answer a null line for yes.
$input
$if answer^=''
  Sorry, merge can't handle unnumbered data sets.  What you should do
  is first edit the data set from which lines are to be copied, and
  then use the merd subcommand.
$else
  Is the data set from which lines are to be copied prefixed with
  your userid?  Enter a null line for yes.
  $input
  $if answer=''
    $until answer^=''
      Enter the data set name, without prefixing your userid, and
      without surrounding apostrophes:
      $input
    $cmd setl name &ANSWER
  $else
    $until answer^=''
      Enter the fully qualified data set name.  Do not surround the
      name in quotes.
    $ans '' doquot
    $cmd setquot name
  $until answer^=''
    Enter the line number of the first line to be copied:
    $input
  $cmd setl l1 &ANSWER
  $until answer^=''
    Enter the line number of the last line to be copied:
    $input
  $cmd setl l2 &ANSWER
  $until answer^=''
    Enter the line number behind which the group of lines are to be
    copied:
  $input
  $cmd setl l3 &ANSWER

  The generated command is as follows:
   m &NAME &L1 &L2 &L3
  do you want it executed?  Enter a null line for yes.
  $input
  $if answer=''
    $cmd m &NAME &L1 &L2 &L3
