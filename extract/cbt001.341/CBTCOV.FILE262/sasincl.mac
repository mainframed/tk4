Your set of SAS/GRAPH statements MUST begin with two statements -

TSO ALLOC FI(SYSLIB) DA('SYS2.SAS.SOURCE') SHR REUSE;
%INCLUDE SYSLIB(IBM3800);

During processing, the IBM3800 value in the second statement is ignored,
and you can specify anything you want in its place. For your
convenience, several members have been stored in SYS2.SAS.SOURCE:

  CITOH   - If output normally prints on a CITOH printer.
  IBM3179 - If output normally prints on a 3179G terminal.
  IBM3192 - If output normally prints on a 3192G terminal.
  IBM3800 - If output normally prints on an IBM3800 laser printer.
  IBM7371 - If output normally is downloaded to a PC for printing.

Your SAS/GRAPH statements may include other GOPTIONS statements, but
you should avoid using the DEVICE, HPOS, and VPOS keywords.

Following is a listing of a sample set of SAS/GRAPH statements:
