                     -----------------------------------

                   THIS IS A COLLECTION OF BATCH UTILTITY PGMS. MY
                   INTENT IS TO PUT TOGETHER A FILE OF THESE PGMS FOR
                   SHARE. SOME ARE ORIGINAL AND MOST WERE OBTAINED FROM
                   OUR OS/MVT DAYS AND CONVERTED. IT IS EMBARRASSING TO
                   TELL MANAGEMENT THAT USERS HAVE LOST FUNCTION MIGRAT-
                   ING TO MVS AND ALL OF ITS WONDERS. HOPEFULLY I CAN
                   DONATE SOME OF THESE HANDY UTILITIES TO OTHERS WHO
                   WERE NOT LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE AN IBM 360 WITH OS/MVT
                   ALOT WAS DEVELOPED FOR OS/MVT AND MUCH OF IT IS STILL
                   APPLICABLE.

          SUMMARY OF THE MODULES CONTAINED.

          UTIL     REL          DESCRIPTION

          ASMBOX1   1    PUT A NICE LOOKING BOX AROUND YOUR ASSEMBLY
                         LISTING OUTPUT. LINECT FOR ASSEMBLY
                         LISTING IS 53. CODE IS 3800 DEPENDENT.

          ASMHNOX   1    A PTF FOR AN ASSEMBLER H BUG.
                         AS YOU KNOW ASM H IS CLASS C NOW.

          ASMR90    1    ROTATE 90 DEGREES ASSEMBLY LISTINGS
                         ON THE 3800 TYPE PRINTERS.

          CATLIST   1    THIS PROGRAM IS FROM MIKE LOOS, DELUXE CHK
                         PRINTERS. THIS WILL DO A VERY FAST LIST OF
                         AN ICF CATALOG FOR GDG'S AND NONVSAM DSNS.
                         LISTING IS IN THE SAME FORMAY AS IDCAMS
                         (WE USED IT TO BUILD A TMC) BUT THE OUTPUT
                         FORMAT WOULD BE VERY EASY TO CHANGE. SEE
                         COMMEMTS IN THE CODE FOR AN EXPLANATION
                         OF ITS SPEED AND RELATION TO RACF.

          COPYFILE  3    POWERFUL COPY TAPE TYPE PROGRAM. IF YOU HAVE
                         MULTIFILE SL TAPES WILL COPY SELECTED
                         FILES VIA A CONTROL CARD.

          CT        3    AIR FORCE DEVELOPED HIGH SPEED TAPECOPY PGM.
                         RUNS AT EXCP SPEED. COPIES LABELED OR UNLABLED
                         SINGLE OR MULTIFILE, AND IF ONE ONE REEL AN
                         AN OPTION TO VERIFY BYTE FOR BYTE. COPIES
                         MULITVOLUME OR MULTIFILE & MULTIVOLUME WITH
                         NO VERIFY FUNCTION.

          C3PO      1    BRIAN SCOTT OF THE US POSTAL SERVICE, TOPEKA
                         KA WROTE C3PO TO BE THE SRB RECEIVER FOR R2D2.
                         R2D2 NEEDS A TASK OF SOME KIND GOING TO BUMP
                         THE SRB OFF OF. MOST PEOPLE HAVE BEEN USING
                         #CMD SUBSYSTEM AND SOME OTHER BRAVE SOLES,
                         JES2. PLUS NOW C3PO WILL TALK TO YOU IF YOU
                         WANT. ANYONE WANTS TO INCREASE HIS VOCABULARY
                         IS WELCOME. HAVE NOT INSTALLED IT THIS WAY
                         BUT WILL WHEN I GO TO MVS/SP1.3.

          C3PO2     1    SAME AS ABOVE, BUT WITH A STIMER IN IT FOR
                         PEOPLE WHO DO NOT WNAT TO RUN C3PO WITH
                         TIME=1440.

          DELINK0   2    SOURCE CARDS FOR IBM FE PROGRAM TO 'DELINK'
                         WE RECONSTRUCTED THE SOURCE IMAGES WITH A
                         DISASSEMBLER AND ALOT OF PATIENCE.  FUN !!!

          DISKMAP   3    DISKMAP PROGRAM THAT HAS 3330 SUPPORT, 3350,
                         3850 SUPPORT INCLUDED. GIVES SIMILIAR INFO
                         TO A COMPAKTOR MAP. THIS NOW DOES NOT UPDATE
                         LASTUSE DATE  FOR EVERY FILE ON THE PACK. NOT
                         NOT REALLY TRUE FOR PDS'S,  SO STILL BEWARE.

          EALSD095  1    EASTERN AIRLINES UPDATE OF THE STANDARD IBM
                         BLOCK LETTER ROUTINE IEFSD095 WHICH WAS USED
                         FOR BANNER PAGES. THE UPDATED VERSION HAS ALL
                         THE SPECIAL CHARACTERS INCLUDED IN IT.

          EXCPMOD   1    MOD (ZAP) TO SHOW EXCP COUNTS ON JCL LISTING.
                         MVS/SP1.1

          EXIMPORT  1    THIS PROGRAM IS FROM MIKE LOOS, DELUXE CHK
                         PRINTERS. WILL CREATE 2 JCL FILES, A CLIST,
                         AND A SYSPRINT LISTING. THE JCL FILES HAVE A
                         SET OF EXPORT AND IMPORT JCL DESIGNED TO
                         EXPORT (VSAM) AND IEBGENER (DSORG=PS) ALL
                         DATASETS ON A VOLUME TO TAPE AND RESTORE THEM
                         WITH IMPORT (VSAM) AND IEBGENER (DSORG=PS)
                         FROM TAPE TO DISK. THE VSAM PORTION WORKS
                         ONLY FOR UNIQUE DATASETS (DFEF) AND BASE
                         CLUSTERS ONLY. SEE THE CODE FOR FURTHER
                         EXPLANATIONS AND RESTRICTIONS.

          IEECVXIT  1    COMBINED VERSION OF 'IEECVXIT AND 'IEECR2D2'.
                         CODED THE WAY IT SHOULD IF YOU A GENIUS. SCH-
                         EDULES AN SRB TO GET AROUND THE FACT THE MOVED
                         WQE CHAIN IN SP1.3. NEEDS SOMETHING RUNNING ALL
                         THE TIME TO BUMP THE SRB OFF OF WHEN IEECR2D2
                         REQUIRED. CODER USED THE #CMD SUBSYSTEM, YOU
                         COULD HAVE USED JES2 HE SAYS. TIME DEPENDENT
                         CODE HAS BEEN REMOVED AND WORKS IN ALL VERSIONS
                         OF MVS/SP.    WE ARE SAVED !!

                         AFDSC DEVELOPED 'MCS EXIT'. HAS THE CAPABILITY
                         TO SUPPRESS OR CHNGE ROUTE CODES, DESC, CODES,
                         ETC. BUT WITH THIS ONE WILL UTILITIZE 'R2D2'
                         TO DO AUTOMATIC OPERATOR REPLIES AND STC'S
                         BASED UPON WHAT COMES ACROSS CONSOLE. IS NOT
                         DEPENDENT UPON THE OPERATOR BEING AWAKE.
                         AFDSC DEVELOPED VERSION OF THE FAMOUS 'R2D2'.
                         LITTLE CREATURE WILL DO AUTOMATIC START CMDS
                         FOR THINGS THAT NEED TO BE STARTED BASED UPON
                         WHAT COMES ACROSS SCREEN AND IS DETECTED BY
                         IEECVXIT. R2D2 WILL DO THE AUTOMATIC REPLIES,
                         RMF ( R XX,GO ), ALLOCATION ( R XX,NOHOLD )
                         EVER HAD OPERATOR TURN YOUR 3081 MVS SYSTEM TO
                         OS/MVT  SYSTEM BY LOCKING Q4 ( R XX,HOLD ).
                         LITTLE CRITTER HAS ALOT OF POSSIBILITIES.

          IEFUTL    1    IBM STANDARD SMF EXIT, IEFUTL. WAIT TIME AND
                         CPU TIME EXCESSION FOR BATCH AND TSO. NOT MUCH
                         CODE BUT ONE THING IT CAN DO IS TO ELIMINATE
                         S522 ABENDS CAUSED BY OPERATORS.

          IEFU29    1    DETECT SMF SWITCH AND SCHEDULE A JOB THAT DUMPS
                         SMF DATASETS. MOVED THESES FUNCTIONS FROM THE
                         'MCS' EXIT TO THIS EXIT (WHERE IT SHOULD BE).

          IEFU83    2    AFDSC DEVELOPED SMF EXIT, 'IEFU83'. HAS ALL
                         STANDARD SUGGESTION FOR TYPE 40 RECS, 0 EXCP
                         COUNTS, ETC. THIS ONE IS BRANCH TABLE DRIVEN,
                         IS A GOOD PLACE TO BEGIN FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO
                         EXPAND ON ITS CODE. ALSO LOOKS AT 14&15'S ETC.

          INCORZAP  2    SOURCE FOR THE FAMOUS 'INCORZAP' THAT IS KNOWN
                         ONLY IN OBJECT FORM. THANKS BILL GODFREY FOR
                         DISASSEMBLY AND PATIENCE.

          IGG019WD  1    APPENDAGE FOR RECOVERY FROM WRONG DENSITY TAPE
                         VOLUMES, USED BY TAPE UTLITIES

          IGG019WE  1    APPENDAGE TO PREVENT ERROR AT EOF, USED BY
                         TAPE UTILITIES.

          INCORZZP  1    ZAP TO THE 'INCORZAP' PROGRAM SO IT WILL
                         RUN UNDER ANY NAME.

          JESX001   1    SP1.3 EXIT.  SEPARATOR (PRINT&PUNCH) FOR
                         JES2. ALSO PRODUCES A RECEIPT ON AN IBM 3287
                         TYPE PRINTER SO USER CAN SIGN RECEIPT AT PCS.
                         USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH EXIT 10 AND 255.
