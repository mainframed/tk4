 PLEASE READ THIS INSTALLATION DOCUMENTATION CAREFULLY BEFORE DOING
  ANYTHING.
 THESE ARE THE STEPS TO BE FOLLOWED IN INSTALLING THIS 3270-II FULL
  SCREEN EDITOR ON YOUR SYSTEM. (THIS SOFTWARE WILL WORK WITH OPERATING
  SYSTEMS FROM MVT TO MVS...BUT KEEP IN MIND THE DEPENDENCIES DESCRIBED
  BELOW).

 1)  FSE HAS ONE MODULE THAT IS OPTIONAL AND ONLY USED IF RUNNING
     MVS. NO CONCERN SHOULD BE MADE ABOUT THIS, SINCE THE CODE WILL
     HANDLE IT, BUT TWO CONSIDERATIONS SHOULD BE NOTED:
     "FSE" WILL FIND OUT IF THE OPERATING SYSTEM IS DRIVEN BY MVS..
     IF SO, IT WILL OS/LINK MODULE "FSEPRTY" TO ALTER THE DISPATCHING
     PRIORITY OF THE ADDRESS SPACE FROM DEFAULT TO 240 AND TAKE IT
     OUT OF APG. THIS IS DONE TO GIVE SECOND AND THIRD IPS INTERVALS
     SUPER RESPONSE BACK AT THE TUBE.
     ONE CONSIDERATION IS THE VALUE OF THIS NEW DISPATCHING PRTY OF
     240 WITH YOUR JOB MIX: KEEP IT THIS HIGH IN AN ENVIRONMENT
     WITH A LOT OF CPU HOGS IN THE SYSTEM AND LITTLE OR MEDIUM
     I/O UTILIZATION, DECREASE DOWN TO 200 FOR MEDIUM CPU AND HIGH
     I/O UTILIZATIONS. (THIS WAS MONITORED BY "RMF" AND "RESOLVE"
     FIND HAPPY MEDIUM WITHOUT LOSING TSO RESPONSE UNDER FSE).
  *  THE OTHER CONSIDERATION IS ONLY THINKABLE IF YOU HAVE A LOTTA
     MEGS ON YOUR CPU TO HANDLE THE EXTRA PAGING IT WILL RESULT IN.
     IF YOU SO CHOOSE, YOU CAN AUTOMATICALLY MAKE YOUR ADDRESS
     SPACE NON-SWAPPABLE AND THE BACK SWAPPABLE UPON ENTERING
     AND LEAVING THE FSE SESSION. THIS WILL RESULT IN IMPROVED
     RESPONSE TIME AND CERTAINLY QUICKER EDITS.
  *  KEEP IN MIND IT DEPENDS ON YOUR STORAGE CONSTRAINS AND JOB MIX.
     TO GIVE YOU AN INITIAL IDEA, YOU SHOULD USE IT WITH MACHINE
     RUNNING 10 BATCH, 5 STARTED TASKS, 10-20 TSO USERS ON FOUR
     MEGABYTES.
  *  BOTH THE NEW PRIORITY AND THE SWAPPABILITY OPTIONS ARE HARDCODED
     IN MODULE "FSE", LOADED ON REGISTER 2 JUST BEFORE ISSUING
     AN OS/LINK TO "FSEPRTY"  ----  LINK  EP=FSEPRTY -----
     THERE ARE ONLY TWO PLACES IN THE SOURCE OF "FSE"  WHERE THIS
     MODULE IS LINKED, THEREFORE IT SHOULD BE NO PROBLEM FINDING IT.
     THE FIRST TIME IT IS CALLED WITH REG 2 =X'800000F0' WHICH MEANS
     A) HIGH BIT ON = NONSWAPPABLE
     B) NEW PRIORITY OF 240
     THE SECOND TIME IT IS CALLED WITH REG 2 =F'126' WHICH MEANS
     A) HIGH BIT OFF = SWAPPABLE AS USUAL
     B) NORMAL PRIORITY OF 126

  *  MAKE THE NECESSARY CHANGES ACCORDING TO YOUR SYSTEM.

2)  ASSEMBLE & LINK MODULES FSEATTR,FSECHANG,FSEFREE,FSEPRTY,
                            FSESAVE,FSESYSCD,FSETSO
    INTO ANY UNAUTHORIZED LINKLIST DATA SET (OR STEPLIBED TO IN
    LOGON PROC)  NONREENTRANT, NONREUSABLE AS STANDALONE MODULES.

2A) ASSEMBLE & LINK FSEPFKEY ANYWHERE.

2B) ASSEMBLE AND LINK FSE INTO A LINKLIST DATA SET AND LINK IT WITH
    PREVIOUSLY ASSEMBLED-LINKED MODULE FSEPFKEY, NORENT, NOREUS.

****** ESSENTIALLY, THE FINAL PRODUCT IS A MAIN MODULE "FSE" WITH ****
****** A SUBROUTINE LINKED IN IT, AND SEVEN (7) SEPARATE MODULES  ****
****** IN THE LINKLIST DATA SET.                                  ****

2C) COPY MEMBER "FSEHELP" INTO "SYS1.HELP(FSE)" TO HAVE THE HELP
   COMMAND AVAILABLE.

3) MODULES "FSE" AND "FSESAVE" ARE INSTALLATION DEPENDENT FOR THE
   "SUBMIT" SUBCOMMAND. "FSESAVE" PERFORMS BOTH THE "SAVE" AND THE
   "SUBMIT" FUNCTIONS. IF IT IS A SUBMIT, IT FORCES AN ALLOCATION
   ON A PREDESCRIBED SCRATCH PACK THAT SHOULD BE INITIALIZED TO
   YOUR INSTALLATION CONFIGURATION. UPON RETURN TO "FSE" THE
   TEMPORARY DATA SET ALLOCATED BY FORCE ON A SCRATCH PACK IS
   DELETED, AGAIN BY A VOLSER HARDCODED IN THE SOURCE. THIS IS
   TO PREVENT TOO MUCH ACCESS BY FSE ON MULTI-TSOPACK CONFIGURATIONS.

   JUST HARDCODE A VOLSER ON THE PARM LIST OF THE SCRATCH MACRO
   (THE ONLY ONE) IN MODULE "FSE" AND IN THE HOUSECLEANING
   BEGGINNING SECTION OF MODULE "FSESAVE". (THE VALUE IN THE VANILLA
   CODE IS "IMG038")

3A) THIS FULLSCREEN EDITOR IS ACCESS METHOD INDEPENDENT (TGET/TPUT),
   BUT A FEATURE HAS BEEN INCORPORATED TO EASE THE OPERATION
   UNDER TCAM TO BYPASS THE JUMPING OF THE CURSOR TO THE NEXT
   LINE UPON ISSUING A TGET (AN OLD PAIN IN THE REAR).
   MODULE  "FSE" WILL SEE IF YOU ARE RUNNING VTAM; IF SO IT KEEPS
   GOING NORMALLY. IF YOU ARE RUNNING TCAM WITH OPERATING SYSTEMS
   OTHER THAN MVS, THE CODE WILL ISSUE A TYPE 4 SVC, NAMELY
   248 (IGC0024H) TO REPOSITION THE TCAM TERMINAL QCB CURSOR TO (0,0)
   SO AS TO ALLOW FOREIGN MESSAGES AS OPERATOR OR JOB-END NOTIFYS
   TO DISPLAY ON THE "UNUSED" TOP LINE OF THE SCREEN WITHOUT
   LOSING IT.
   THIS SVC IS ALSO USED BY MODULE "FSEPRTY" FOR KEY ZERO SERVICE,
   THEREFORE BOTH VTAM AND TCAM USERS SHOULD ASSEMBLE AND LINK
   IGC0024H (OR YOUR OWN NUMBER) INTO SYS1.LPALIB. REMEMBER TO ALSO
   CHANGE THE SVC NUMBER TO YOUR OWN AROUND LABEL "READSCR" IN
   MODULE "FSE" AND AT BEGGINNING SECTION IN MODULE "FSEPRTY"
   (IF YOU NEED TO), AND TO IPL SYSTEM WITH CLPA.

4) WITH TCAM, MAKE SURE THE CUTOFF MACRO IN THE INHDR PART OF THE
    TSO MESSAGE HANDLER IS 2100 OR GREATER (ALSO IN NCP IF USED)
   WITH VTAM USE ENOUGH BUFFERS AND BUFSIZE TO ACCOMMODATE 2100 BYTES
   TO SKIP ANY CHAINING THAT CAN SLOW YOU DOWN.

5) MODIFY "SYS1.PARMLIB(IKJPRMXX)" UNDER TCAM OR
   "SYS1.PARMLIB(TSOKEY00)" TO ALLOW FULL SCREEN SUPPORT BY
   INCREASING OWAITHI AND INLOCKHI TO 24 ELSE FSE WILL NOT BE
   ABLE TO READ OR WRITE FULL SCREENS OF DATA.
   ALSO (MVT,SVS) MAKE SURE YOUR TSO REGIONS SIZE IN IKJPRMXX
   IS LARGE ENOUGH FOR REQUIRED GETMAINS...(REGSIZE=600K
   IS TYPICAL FOR PROGRAM SIZES OF 5000 LINES LRECL 80).

6) REMEBER, FSE WAS DESIGNED AND WRITTEN TO DRAW CIRCLES AROUND
   OTHER MANUFACTURER"S FULL SCREEN EDITORS IN PERFORMANCE.
   BE SURE ALL THOSE DETAILS ABOVE ARE FOLLOWED TO GAIN 100%
   OF ITS CAPABILITIES.
