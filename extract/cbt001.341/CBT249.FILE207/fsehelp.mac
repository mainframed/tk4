)F FUNCTION -
  THE FSE COMMAND IS USED TO CREATE OR MODIFY SEQUENTIAL DATA SETS,
  MEMBERS OF PARTITIONED DATA SETS OR THE BROWESING BACK AND FORTH
  OF UN-NUMBERED DATA SETS (DUMPS ETC..). IT ALLOWES THE SIMULTANEOUS
  UPDATE OF UP TO 21 LINES ON A CRT TERMINAL AND THE EXECUTION
  OF AN FSE SUBCOMMAND OR TSO COMMAND AT THE SAME TIME.
  THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A SCREEN IMAGE BACK AT THE TERMINAL :

  FSE HAS 4 MODES OF DATA MODIFICATION, WHICH MAY BE USED CUNCURRENTLY
  OR SEPARATLY.
    A) ENTERING AN FSE SUBCOMMAND OR A TSO COMMAND (ALL EXCEPT IDCAMS
       RELATED I.E. DELETE, LISTC ETC.., TIME AND EXEC).
    B) MOVING THE CRT CURSOR TO ANY OF THE DATA LINES (UP TO 21) AND
       MODIFYING DATA BY TYPING OVER THE OLD ONE.
    C) BY USING THE CHARACTER IMMEDIATLY FOLLOWING THE LINE NUMBER
       AND IMMEDIATLY PRECEDING THE DATA FIELD IN THE SAME LINE.
       A DIGIT 0 - 9 WILL INSERT THAT MANY BLANK LINES AFTER THAT
       PARTICULAR LINE.
       A CHARACTER "F" AND "L" IN TWO DIFFERENT LINES BUT ON THE
       SAME SCREEN (FIRST & LAST) WILL DELETE THAT RANGE OF LINES.
       A CHARACTER "D"  WILL DELETE THAT LINE.
    D) BY ALTERING TE ACTUAL 6 DIGIT LINE NUMBER TO THE NUMBER OF
       OF ANOTHER LINE NUMBER. THIS WILL COPY THE ALTERED LINE
       TO THE OTHER.
 NOTE: IF YOU HAVE TERMINALS WITH KEYBOARDS EQUIPPED WITH PROGRAM
       FUNCTION KEYS, EACH PFK CAN BE USED TO PRE-PROGRAM ANY
       SUBCOMMAND OR NATIVE TSO COMMAND. (SEE THE DESCRIPTION
       OF THE "PFK" COMMAND ON ITS USE.)

  IN ESSENCE THE USER HAS THE ABILITY OF DOING ALL FOUR FUNCTIONS
    AT THE SAME TIME, WHILE MIXING FUNCTION B, C AND D IN ANY
    COMBINATION OR LINE(S).

  NOTE - IF NO DATA IS ALTERED, NO COMMAND ENTERED, NO FIELDS
         MODIFIED AND USER PRESSES ENTER KEY, FSE WILL EITHER
         PAGE FORWARD OR BACKWARD 21 LINES DEPENDING ON THE
         PREVIOUS DIRECTION.
       - IF DATA IS TO BE MODIFIED BY TYPING OVER THE OLD ONE,
         AND THE NEW DATA IS LONGER, THE USER MUST FIRST PRESS
         THE ERASE-END-OF-FILE KEY AT THE END OF THE LINE TO BE
         MODIFIED (BY THE TRAILING BLANKS), AND SUBSEQUENTLY RETURN
         AND DO THE INSERT-KEY FUNCTION.
)X SYNTAX -
         FSE    'DSNAME'  NEW/OLD  LIST/NOLIST
                CLIST/DATA/CNTL/ASM/PLI/COBOL
  REQUIRED - 'DSNAME' & BLANKS SEPARATING KEYWORDS
  DEFAULTS - OLD,NOLIST
  ALIAS    - NONE
  NOTE     - THE DATA SET MUST HAVE VALID LINE NUMBERS IN ASCENDING
             ORDER NOT EXCEEDING 999999, ELSE USER WILL BE ASKED TO
             EITHER RENUMBER IT OR END FSE SESSION.
  NOTE     - IF THE FULLY QUALIFIED DATA SET NAME IS SPECIFIED, IT MUST
             BE ENCLOSED IN SINGLE QUOTES. IF THE DATA SET NAME IS NOT
             ENTERED WITHIN QUOTES, THE USERID IS ALWAYS APPENDED TO
             THE LEFT OF THE NAME. THE RIGHTMOST QUALIFIER OF THE
             NAME ENTERED MAY BE A DESCRIPTIVE QUALIFIER FOR A
             PARTICULAR DATA SET TYPE.
  NOTE     - DATA SET TYPE IS ONLY REQUIRED IF THE LAST QUALIFIER IN
             THE DATA SET NAME IS NOT EITHER ASM,PLI,DATA,CLIST OR
             CNTL. IF THE KEYWORD "LIST" WAS SPECIFED, A QUALIFIER
             IS NOT REQUIRED.
)O OPERANDS -
  'DSNAME' - NAME OF THE DATA SET TO BE CREATED OR EDITED.
))NEW      - DATA SET NAMED DID NOT EXIST BEFORE COMMAND WAS ISSUED.
))OLD      - DATA SET ALREADY EXISTED WHEN THE EDIT COMMAND WAS ISSUED.
))LIST     - ONLY BROWESING WILL BE ALLOWED. (USED TO SCAN BACK AND
             FORTH ON DUMPS, JCL OUTPUT ETC..)
           - THIS OPTION REQUIRES NO DATA SET TYPE KEYWORD.
))NOLIST   - FULL EDITING WILL BE ALLOWED.
))COBOL    - DATA CONSISTS OF COBOL SOURCE STATEMENTS.
))ASM      - DATA CONSISTS OF ASSEMBLER SOURCE STATEMENTS.
))DATA     - DATA IS TO BE INPUT TO A PROGRAM.
))CLIST    - DATA IS INPUT TO AN EXEC COMMAND.
))CNTL     - DATA IS CONTROL DATA FOR A SUBMIT COMMAND.
))PLI      - INPUT DATA CONSISTS OF PLI SOURCE STATEMENTS.

  S         - WILL SAVE THE DATA SET BACK TO DISK.
            - 'DSNAME' FOLLOWES SAME TSO STANDARDS AS IN FSE COMMAND

                          SUBCOMMAND ALONE WILL SAVE INTO THE
                          ORIGINAL DATA SET.
      NOTE: - THE SAVE FUNCTION WILL RETURN ANY MESSAGES OR ABEND
