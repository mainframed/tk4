   The "SAL" program is a friendlier replacement for the TSO
   "LISTALC" command.  "SAL" stands for "Show ALlocations."

   SAL shows DDNAME, DATASET NAME, STATUS, NORMAL DISPOSITION and
   DATASET TYPE for each allocation.  It was designed to produce
   more readable output than "LISTALC."  It's primary use is in
   developing CLISTs and ISPF/PDF dialogs.

   SAL uses dynamic allocation information retrieval to get
   information about all current allocations.  See the MVS Job
   Management manual for more info on this use of dynamic
   allocation.

   SAL writes to file SYSPRINT, which would normally be allocated to
   the user's TSO terminal.  It works with Session Manager or
   without it, and is written to be reentrant.

   This package includes well-commented assembler code (member
   "SAL"), macros ("XSAVE1," "XRETURN," "REGISTER," "DYNABLD," and
   "DYNATXTU"), and a TSO HELP member ("SALHELP").
