INTRODUCTION, APPENDIX I                                               @

This appendix describes the CALC subcommand, which provides a desk
calculator function under ABE.  It accepts statements which consist of
arithmetic expressions, assignment operators, and function references,
and prints results at the terminal.  A typical statement might be -

   calc a#23+b#14

which would first assign the value 14 to variable named b, and then
would assign 37 to variable a.

Numeric constants in expressions to CALC may be either decimal or
hexadecimal.  A typical decimal constant would be 23.456.  Hexadecimal
constants are of the form -

   x'<string>'

where <string> is from 1 to 8 hexadecimal digits, e.g.:

   calc x'23'*2

could produce the result 70, which is decimal 35 twice.  Note that
the hexadecimal equivalent of 70, which is 46, could have been
printed by invoking the HEX function:

   calc hex(x'23'*2)

The variable names used are symbolic variable names that can be used
elsewhere.  For example, if a RUN subcommand list consisting of the
following statements were executed -

     calc a#-(23+b#14)
     set 10 'a = &a  b = &b'

The results would be that line 10 would contain  -

     A = -37   B = 00014

Note that the replacement value for the symbolic variables used on the
left of assignment statements (the # is the assignment operator) will
be a character string consisting of a minus sign (-) if the value is
negative, followed by the integer part, followed by a period and up to
5 digits of fractional precision.  (If the number is an integer, CALC
will try to generate a replacement value of 5 digits, left zero
filled.  This is useful when calculating field names of the form
Fddddd - See the PDF keyword).

SYSEVAL - A SPECIAL SYMBOLIC VARIABLE                                  @

&SYSEVAL, which is followed by a parenthesized expression, is a special
symbolic variable. The CALC subcommand will be invoked to evaluate the
expression, and the result will replace both the string &SYSEVAL and
the parenthesized expression, e.g. the subcommand -

    r nl The trigonometric sin of 45 degrees is &SYSEVAL(sind(45))..

will create a new record in the current dataset containing the string
"The trigonometric sin of 45 degrees is .707107".

RETURN CODE - SETTING WITH CALC                                        @

The variable RC is a special variable.  Whatever number you assign to
this variable will be set as the return code when ABE terminates.
Note that the value in RC is different than the value you get when
you reference variable LASTCC.  LASTCC gives you the return code
from the most recently executed ABE subcommand.  Note that the value
you assign to RC should be less than 999.

LISTING VARIABLES                                                      @

To list the contents of any variable, just enter its name -

   calc a

The result printed in the message area on the screen in this case
would be -

   -37

MSG VARIABLE AND THE CALC SUBCOMMAND                                   @

As already indicated, under certain conditions CALC will print results
in the message area of the screen.  When it does this, it also sets
variable &MSG to whatever value is displayed.  Thus, the sequence -

   calc 23**2
   r nl &MSG

would create a new record in the current dataset containing the value
529.

FUNCTION REFERENCES IN CALC                                            @

Function references are also allowed.  Entering, for example -

   1+sin(3.14159/4)

would result in -

     1.707089

Being printed at the terminal (note that whenever the leftmost
operator is not an assignment operator, the results of the expression
will be printed at the terminal).

The sin function used in the above expression is built in to the CALC
subcommand.  A complete list of such built in functions follows.

FUNCTIONS, CHARACTER - accepting character literals and variables      @

    INDEX  - Returns the offset within operand 1 of operand 2,
             e.g. -

               /setl abc 'how now brown cow '/calc index(abc,'now')

             produces 5 as the result.

    LENGTH - Returns the length of the specified variable or
             literal, e.g. -

               /setl abc 'hi there'/calc length(abc)

             produces 8 as the result.

    VERIFY - Returns the offset within operand 1 of the first
             character which does not appear in operand 2, e.g.:

               calc verify('012a3','0123456789')

             produces 4 as the result.

FUNCTIONS, NILADIC  - requiring no parameters                          @

    DATE  - date in the form yymmdd
    ECHO  - causes all subsequently entered expressions to be
            echoed back to the terminal after being converted to
            polish notation.  Also, if the leftmost operator in
            an expression is an assignment, the value assigned
            will be printed.
    TIME  - time in the form hhmmss

FUNCTIONS, MONADIC  - requiring one parameter                          @
    Note:  There are a series of date functions which are monadic,
    but which are listed under the separate heading FUNCTIONS, DATE
    below.

            truly random.  Otherwise, number is part of repeatable
            sequence (given the same starting seed) which has a
            distribution consistent with that of a true random
            number.
    SBA   - Given an offset, relative 0, to a position on a 3270-type
            crt screen, the sba function will return a number which,
            when stored in a 2-byte binary field, contains the
            correct value to use in an SBA command transmitted to
            the terminal, e.g. "calc sba(23)" produces 16599, which
            appears as 40D7 in binary; this is the correct value to
            use when referring to location 23 on the screen in an
            SBA command.

    PEEK  - PEEK(x,y) returns the contents of main storage at
            address x for a length of y.  if y is zero or omitted,
            a default length of 4 bytes is used.

    ENTRY - The first argument must be the address to be invoked via
            standard OS linkage conventions.  The other arguments,

FUNCTIONS, USER-DEFINED                                                @

In addition to the built-in functions described above, user-defined
functions may also be used in expressions to be evaluated by the CALC
subcommand.  When the CALC subcommand recognizes a function reference
(the name is always succeeded by a parenthesized set of operands),
it scans the list of built-in functions.  If it doesn't find a match,
a RUN subcommand of the following format is issued -

  run <function_name> <operand_1> <operand_2> <operand_3> . . .

where <function_name> is the function name encountered in the
expression, and <operand_1>, <operand_2>, etc., are the operands
that follow in parentheses the function name in the expression.

If the return code from the RUN subcommand indicates the named set of
subcommands was found and successfully executed, the CALC subcommand
will obtain the replacement value for the symbolic variable with name
matching <function_name>, and this will be used as the value for the
function in the expression.

For example, consider the following member of my SYSRUN dataset:

  DSN=X75826.SYSRUN(INTERP)
    $* Interpolation function
    $* Given (p1,p2), (p3,p4), and p5 representing
    $* (x1,y1), (x2,y2) and x, this function will interpolate y.
    $* First calculate slope, m = (y1-y2)/(x1-x2)
      calc p6#(p2-p4)/(p1-p3)
    $* Now calculate intercept, b = y1-m*x1
      calc p7#p2-p6*p1
    $* now calculate y = p6*p5+p7
      calc interp#p6*p5+p7

If I issue the subcommand -

  calc 1+interp(2,4,6,8,10)

the resulting message will be "13."

For a second example, consider the following members of my SYSRUN
dataset:

  DSN=X75826.SYSRUN(GALLONS)
    $* CONVERT GALLONS TO LITERS
    CALC GALLONS#P1*3.785
  DSN=X75826.SYSRUN(OUNCES)
    $* CONVERT OUNCES TO LITERS
    CALC OUNCES#P1*.0295703125
  DSN=X75826.SYSRUN(PINTS)
    $* CONVERT PINTS TO LITERS
    CALC PINTS#P1*.473125
  DSN=X75826.SYSRUN(QUARTS)
    $* CONVERT QUARTS TO LITERS
    CALC QUARTS#P1*.94625

To find how many pints in a gallon, I could enter the subcommand -

  calc gallons(1)/pints(1)

and the answer would be 8.

OPERATORS IN CALC                                                      @

Acceptable operators and their evaluation priorities are listed below.
Note that except for the assignment and exponentiation operator,
operators are processed left-to-right by evaluation priority (e.g.
multiplication is evaluated before addition).  If you have any
questions as to the order of evaluation of any expression, enter the
ECHO function.  From that point until the ECHO function is reissued,
All expressions will be printed back at the terminal after they have
been converted to polish notation. This will make the order of
evaluation obvious.

     2          prefix +
     2          prefix -
     2          prefix ^

CHARACTER LITERALS IN EXPRESSIONS                                      @

Character literals can appear in expressions, either as operands to
character functions, e.g. INDEX('abc','a'), or as operands to
relational operators, e.g. name>'smith'.

In an expression involving a variable name and a character literal
(e.g. name='smith') the value for the variable is compared as a
character variable, and does not have to contain only numeric
characters.

ENTRY FUNCTION - CALLING OS INTERNAL ROUTINES                          @
