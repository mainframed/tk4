ABE can directly edit both DB2 tables and members of SAS libraries.
following is a clist called TRANSFER which helps to illustrate how
this is done.

TRANSFER clist                                                         @

PROC 2 INDSN OTDSN SASIN DB2IN SASOUT DB2OUT
CONTROL PROMPT
DSN
RUN CP PLAN(ABE)
ABE &INDSN O(&OTDSN) &SASIN &DB2IN &SASOUT &DB2OUT INP(SE) HARDCOPY
END

The help data for the above clist is shown below

 F FUNCTION
 Use the TRANSFER command to copy between SAS libraries and DB2
 tables.
 X SYNTAX
 %TRANSFER <FROM> <TO> DB2IN SASIN DB2OUT SASOUT
 O OPERANDS
 <FROM> - SAS library name and parenthesized SAS dataset name,
   e.g. sas.data(mydata), or DB2 table name, e.g. mydata, from
   which data is to be copied.
 <TO> - SAS library name and parenthesized SAS dataset name,
   e.g. sas.data(mydata), or DB2 table name, e.g. mydata, to
   which data is to be copied.
 )DB2IN - Specified to indicate that <FROM> specifies the name of
   a DB2 table.
 )DB2OUT - Specified to indicate that <TO> specifies the name of
   a DB2 table.
 )SASIN - Specified to indicate that <FROM> specifies the name of
   a SAS library and data set.
 )SASOUT - Specified to indicate that <TO> specifies the name of
   a SAS library and data set.

 NOTE:  At least two of the keywords DB2IN, DB2OUT, SASIN, and
 SASOUT must be specified.  You can specify any of the possible
 combinations of pairs except DB2IN/SASIN and DB2OUT/SASOUT,
 which of course would be meaningless.

 NOTE:  The maximum allowable character variable is 70 bytes.

 NOTE:  There currently exists a limitation as to the maximum
 number of observations/table rows you can copy with TRANSFER.
 The following calculation will give you a rough estimate:

 Let -
   C=total length of all character variables.
   N=total number of numeric variables.

   MAXIMUM = 15,000 / CEIL((C + 15 * N) / 72)

Generally, ABE lets you conveniently migrate data between DB2 tables
and TSO data sets.  For example, suppose I am looking at the following
TSO data set using ABE:

  DBD×SUPPNO×NAME $         ×ADDRESS $                        ×
     51     DEFECTO PARTS.  16 BUM ST., BROKEN HAND WY
     52     VESUVIUS, INC.  312 ANCIENT BLVD., POMPEII NY
     53     ATLANTIS CO.    8 OCEAN AVE., WASHINGTON DC
     54     TITANIC PARTS   32 LARGE ST., BIGTOWN TX
     57     EAGLE HARDWARE  64 TRANQUILITY PLACE, APOLLO MN
     61     SKY PARTS       128 ORBIT BLVD., SIDNEY AUSTRALIA
     64     KNIGHT LTD.     256 ARTHUR COURT, CAMELOT ENGLAND

I can get this data stored in a DB2 table simply by entering the
command "s supplier db2".  The top line above, labeled DBD, tells
ABE what the column names should be, and the $ shown over
some columns indicates they contain character data; the default
is numeric.  If the table "supplier" doesn't currently exist when
the command is entered, it will be created automatically for me.
NOTE THAT A COMMIT IS AUTOMATICALLY DONE AFTER THE TABLE HAS
BEEN STORED.

I can also enter any DB2 SQL statement under this facility,
simply by preceding it with the keyword "DB2".  So, for example,
I can enter "db2 drop table xyz".  NOTE THAT A COMMIT IS EXECUTED
AUTOMATICALLY BY ABE AFTER EVERY SUCH STATEMENT.

If I am currently looking at a DB2 table under this facility, I
can delete the table simply by entering "$purge".  ABE
will do a DB2 DROP statement for the table, AND WILL THEN DO A
COMMIT.

There are times when it is useful just to know the column names
and attributes.  If I enter -

    DB2 CONTENT X29708.DISKRPT

the following is displayed at my terminal:

     TABLE=X29708.DISKRPT
       DSNAME CHAR(44) NOT NULL
       DIV CHAR(2)
       DEPT CHAR(3)
       APPL CHAR(4)
       TYPE CHAR(1)
       PGMRID CHAR(8)
       ALLOCTRK DECIMAL(5,0)
       USEDTRK DECIMAL(5,0)
       REFDATE CHAR(5)
       REQDATE CHAR(5)
       VOLUME CHAR(6)
       SOURCE CHAR(8)
       NAME CHAR(30)
