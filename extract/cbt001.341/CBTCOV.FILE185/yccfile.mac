* TSO EDITOR FILE SUBCOMMAND
* OS VS2 R3.0  MAY,1975 HOWARD GILBERT
* REENTRANT AND ALL THAT GOOD STUFF
* ALL WE DO IS GET TWO DOUBLEWORDS FOR A NEW COMMAND BUFFER
* PUT AN 'END SAVE' COMMAND IN THE BUFFER,
* PUT THE ADDRESS OF THE BUFFER IN CAPTNBFR IN THE EDITOR
* COMMUNICATIONS SAVE AREA.
* SET THE CAATN SWITCH.
* AND RETURN.
* THIS IS LIKE A STACK COMMAND, BUT CHEAPER.
