MAXLEN   TITLE 'ROUTINE TO GET THE MAX LENGTH OF A PL/I CHAR STRING'
* MAXLEN:  ON ENTRY R1 POINTS TO A PARAMETER LIST WHICH CONTAINS THE
* ADDRESS OF AN 8 BYTE PL/I LOCATOR-DESCRIPTOR AND THE ADDRESS OF
* A HALFWORD (WHICH RECEIVES THE MAX LENGTH VALUE).
* BYTES 4-5 OF THE LOCATOR-DESCRIPTOR CONTAIN THE MAXIMUM LENGTH
* OF A PL/I VARYING LENGTH CHARACTER STRING (SEE THE PL/I EXECUTION
* LOGIC MANUAL FOR DETAILS).
* NOTE THAT FOR A FIXED LENGTH STRING THE MAX LENGTH IS ALWAYS EQUAL
* TO THE CURRENT LENGTH WHICH CAN BE FOUND USING THE PL/I BUILTIN
* LENGTH FUNCTION (HOWEVER THIS ROUTINE WILL ALSO GET THE LENGTH
* OF A FIXED CHARACTER STRING).
* THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROGRAM IS TRIVIAL AND SHOULD BE A
* FEATURE OF THE PL/I LANGUAGE.
* PL/I DECLARATION:
* DCL MAXLEN   ENTRY(*) EXT RETURNS(FIXED BIN (15,0));
* ATTRIBUTES:  REUSABLE, REFRESHABLE, REENTRANT.
