 5.  The program uses GTE Laboratories macros for standard linkage
     conventions and register equates.  They are:

            LINKSAVE
            LINKBACK
            EQ$R

 6.  The program uses GTE Laboratories macros for dynamic allocation.
     Documentation is in macro GTEDADOC.  All features used by PDF have
     been tested and found okay.  However, GTE Laboratories has not
     completed testing other features which are not used by PDF.  Not
     all features have been included yet, and not all of those which
     have been included have been tested.  If you use these macros for
     other applications, please let GTE Laboratories know of any
     bugs...  especially the ones you have corrected!
