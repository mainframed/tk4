 THE PROGRAM IS FAIRLY SIMPLE. IT READS THE MACROS THAT YOU INPUT TO YOU
 SYSGEN STAGE 1 ASSEMBLY. IT HAS A TABLE OF DEVICE ADDRESSES. IT USES TH
 INFORMATION FROM EACH 'IODEVICE' MACRO TO SET THE DEVICE TYPE FIELD IN
 TABLE FOR EACH ADDRESS. A RANGE OF ADDRESSES IN AN 'IODEVICE' MACRO WIL
 A RANGE OF TABLE ENTRIES. IF THE 'IODEVICE' SPECIFIES 'OPTCHAN', THE OP
 ADDRESSES WILL ALSO BE SET TO THAT DEVICE TYPE.

 ONCE ALL THE 'IODEVICE' MACROS HAVE BEEN PROCESSED, THE CONSOLE MACROS
 INTERROGATED TO CHANGE THE DEVICE TYPE FIELD FOR EACH ADDRESS DEFINED A
 CONSOLE. THE MASTER CONSOLE IS DEFINED AS 'MCON', SECONDARY CONSOLES AR
 'SCON'.

 AFTER ALL INPUT HAS BEEN PROCESSED THE PROGRAM PRINTS A REPORT OF ALL T
 ADDRESSES IN THE SYSTEM, SHOWING THE DEVICE TYPE ASSIGNED TO EACH ADDRE
 MSS VIRTUAL VOLUMES ARE SHOWN AS '333V' AND OPTIONAL ADDRESSES (OPTCHAN
 ARE PRECEDED BY AN ASTERISK ('*').

 THE REPORT IS PRINTED SUCH THAT EACH CHANNEL APPEARS AS A 16X16 MATRIX
 ADDRESSES. THERE IS ONE CHANNEL PER PAGE. WE HAVE A 3800 PRINTER AND US
 PAPER THAT IS 8-1/2W X 11L, 8 L.P.I., 15 PITCH. THE PROGRAM USES THE
 VERTICAL BAR ('×') AND THE UNDERLINE ('_') TO PRINT THE MATRIX. IF YOU
 HAVE A 3800, YOU MIGHT WANT TO MAKE THE APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENTS. THE ON
 CHANNEL SKIPS ARE CHANNEL 1 AND IT PRINTS AROUND 58 LINES PER PAGE.

 THE JCL TO RUN THIS PROGRAM IS:
