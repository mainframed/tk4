*        THE MVS SYSOUT DUMP UTILITY CREATES JES2 OR HASP-IV SYSOUT    *
*        DATA SETS FROM MVS EXTERNAL WRITER OUTUPUT.  IT RUNS AS A     *
*        NORMAL BATCH JOB AND ITERFACES WITH JES2 OR HASP THROUGH      *
*        NORMAL SYSOUT PROCESSING.  IT DOES NOT INTERFACE DIRECTLY     *
*        WITH THE SUBSYSTEM OR ITS SPOOLING DEVICE IN ANY MANNER.      *
*        IT MERELY CREATES ITS OWN SYSOUT DATA SETS FROM THE OUTPUT    *
*        OF THE EXTERNAL WRITER                                        *
*                                                                      *
*        THE UTILITY CONSIST OF 4 PROGRAMS, THE FIRST OF WHICH ACTS    *
*        AS A SEPARATOR ROUTINE FOR THE EXTERNAL WRITER AND WRITES     *
*        CONTROL INFORMATION IN FRONT OF EACH SYSOUT DATA SET.         *
*        THESE CONTROL RECORDS CONTAIN PERTINENT INFORMATION ABOUT     *
*        THE DATA SET SUCH AS FORM NUMBER, NUMBER OF COPIES,ROUTING    *
*        INFORMATION, ETC.                                             *
*                                                                      *
*        THE SECOND PROGRAM CREATES NEW MVS SYSOUT.  IT READS THE FILE *
*        CREATED BY THE EXTERNAL WRITER AND DYNAMICALL ALLOCATES NEW   *
*        SYSOUT DATA SETS USING THE INFORMATION FROM THE CONTROL       *
*        RECORDS.  THE THIRD AND FOURTH PROGRAMS ARE MODIFIED VERSIONS *
*        OF THE SECOND ONE, AND ARE USED TO CREATE SVS/HASP SYSOUT.    *
*        THE THIRD PROGRAM PASSES THE EXTERNAL WRITER FILE AND         *
*        GENERATES JCL AND HASP CONTROL CARS FOR THE FOURTH PROGRAM,   *
*        WHICH READS THE FILE AND WRITES THE DATA TO SYSOUT.           *
*                                                                      *

*        1.   THE SEPARATOR PROGRAM IS WRITEN TO INTERFACE WITH        *
*             VS2/R3.0 OF THE EXTERNAL WRITER AND DEPENDS ON CERTAIN   *
*             REGISTER CONTENTS BEYOND THE STANDARD LINKAGE            *
*             CONVENTIONS AT ENTRY FROM THE EXTERNAL WRITER.           *
*             THERE IS ALSO A SUPERZAP FOR MODULE IASXSD82 OF THE      *
*             EXTERNAL WRITER TO CAUSE THE SEPARATOR ROUTINE TO GET    *
*             CONTROL FOR EVERY DATA SET INSTEAD OF JUST ON A NEW      *
*             JOBNAME.                                                 *

*        2.   THE 2 SVS PROGRAMS REQUIRE HASP-IV OR ABOVE BECAUSE      *
*             OF THE HASP CONTROL CARDS.                               *
*                                                                      *
*        3.   PUNCH SYSOUT DATA SETS ARE NOT SUPPORTED, ALTHOUGH       *
*             THIS WOULD BE FEASIBLE WITH SOME MODIFICATION.           *
*                                                                      *
*        4.   THE SEPARATOR ROUTINE USED BY PROGRAMS 2 AND 4 IS        *
*             THE JES2 SEPARATOR.  HOWEVER, THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES *
*             BECAUSE SOME OF THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE         *
*             STANDARD SEPARATOR IS UNAVAILABLE.                       *
*                                                                      *
*        5.   THE JES2 JOB STATISTICS ARE NOT PRINTED                  *
*                                                                      *

*        THE 4 PROGRAMS ARE: EWTR1, EWTR2, EWTR2SVS AND EWTR3SVS.      *
*        IF IT IS DESIRABLE TO CHANGE THESE NAMES TO CONFORM TO        *
*        YOUR INSTALLATION'S STANDARDS, THE PARM INFORMATION IN THE    *
*        EXTERNAL WRITER PROC MUST BE CHANGED TO REFLECT THE NEW NAME  *
*        OF EWTR1, AND THE CONSTANT AT SYMBOL 'EXEC' IN EWTR2SVS MUST  *
*        BE CHANGE TO REFLECT THE NEW NAME OF EWTR3SVS.  IN FACT YOU   *
*        MAY WISH TO CHANGE THE ENTIRE EWTR3SVS JOBSTREAM STARTING AT  *
*        SYMBOL 'JOBCARD' IN EWTR2SVS.                                 *
*        EACH OF THESE PROGRAMS CONTAINS A NON-IBM MACRO, SYMGR, WHICH *
*        IS CONTAINED IN THIS PDS.  THEY ALSO ALL CONTAIN THE MVS SSOB *
*        DSECT MACRO, IEFJSSOB, WHICH CAN BE FOUND IN THE MVS          *
*        DISTRIBUTION LIBRARY SYS1.AMACLIB.                            *

*        EWTR1 IS THE EXTERNAL WRITER SEPARATOR ROUTINE WHICH WRITES   *
*        THE 2 CONTROL RECORDS IN FRONT OF EACH SYSOUT DATA SET.       *
*        THE FIRST RECORD IS IDENTIFIED BY 'EWTR' AND CONTAINS THE     *
*        DATE, TIME, FCBID, BLOCKSIZE, LRECL AND RECFM OF THE          *
*        FOLLOWING SYSOUT DATASET.  THE SECOND RECORD IS THE SSOB AS   *
*        RETURNED TO IASXSD82 BY JES2.                                 *
*                                                                      *
*        EWTR2 IS THE MVS PROGRAM WHICH READS THE OUTPUT TAPE AND      *
*        RESPOOLS THE SYSOUT.                                          *
*                                                                      *
*        EWTR2SVS IS THS SVS PROGRAM WHICH PASSES THE OUTPUT TAPE AND  *
*        GENERATES THE JCL AND HASP CONTROL CARDS FOR EWTR3SVS.  IT    *
*        IS A MODIFIED VERSION OF EWTR2 AND STILL CONTAINS SOME        *
*        REDUNDANT CODE AND WORK AREAS WHICH YOU  MAY WANT TO REMOVE.  *
*                                                                      *
*        EWTR3SVS IS THE SECOND SVS PROGRAM.  IT READS THE EXTERNAL    *
*        WRITER OUTPUT TAPE AND RESPOOLS THE SYSOUT.  IT TOO IS A      *
*        MODIFIED EWTR2 AND ALSO CONTAINS SOME REDUNDANCIES WHICH      *
*        YOU MAY WANT TO ELIMINATE.                                    *
