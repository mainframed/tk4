 WE AT CBT HAD A COUPLE OF PROBLEMS GETTING THE TWO CSECTS TO COMPILE
 AND RUN. HENCE WE ADDED OUR VERSIONS IN THIS FILE, WE BASICALLY GOT
 THE CHANGES FROM MELLON BANK. OUR VERSIONS ARE:
          CBTQI (HJSTNEQI)
          CBTQP (HJSTN2QP)


     HJSTP  SP3 MODIFICATIONS

ONLY TWO MODULES IN HJSTP NEED REPLACING:
QUEUE INITIALIZATION AND QUEUE PROCESSING. COMPLETE MODULE REPLACEMENTS
ARE IN THIS PDS. THEY NEED TO BE RE-ASSEMBLED AND RE-LINKED
INTO THE LOAD MOUDLE. IF YOU ARE CURRENTLY RUN NJE, THESE MODULES WILL
AND MUST REPLACE YOUR CURRENT ONES. REASON BEING THAT I MADE THE MODS
IN Q1 AND QP BE ACCESSED AS NJE2R2 PARM IN THE HJSTP PROGRAM. SINCE
SP3 HAS NJE INTEGRATED, I THOUGHT THERE WAS NO PROBLEM. IF YOU DO
HAVE NJE, YOU MUST THEREFORE HAVE TWO SEPARATE LOAD MODULES-ONE FOR
NJE/3 AND ONE FOR SP3.

THERE ARE NO DD CARD OR LINK CHANGES

TWO NOTES:  1) IN THE HJSTMAP MODULES, UPDATES SHOULD BE MADE TO
               MAP EQUIVALENCE TABLES INTO THE NEW FORMAT (NNNNRRRR).
               I HAVE NOT DONE THIS TO DATE.

            2) I CURRENTLY DO NOT RUN NJE-THEREFORE THERE COULD
               BE ERRORS IN HJSTP THAT I HAVE NOT FOUND YET. I'LL
               BE GLAD TO DISCUSS THESE ON THE TELEPHONE.
