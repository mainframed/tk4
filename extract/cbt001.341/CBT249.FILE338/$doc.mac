  THIS PDS CONTAINS SIX MEMBERS. THEY ARE:

  1. $DOC       THIS IS IT.

  2. AEI005P1   THIS MEMBER CONTAINS SOURCE UPDATES TO TWO IMS (115)
                MODULES IN SMP FORMAT THAT WILL FORCE THE ANACONDA
                SIGNON MFS MODULE TO APPEAR TO IMS USERS AT TWO
                DIFFERENT TIMES. 1ST, WHEN THE TERMINAL CONNECTS TO
                IMS AND THE 'TERMINAL CONNECTED' MESSAGE IS ISSUED,
                AND 2ND, WHEN THE IMS USER ISSUES A '/SIGN OFF'.
                THIS CODE ALSO FITS ON IMS 1.2 AT PTF LEVEL 8109.

  3. COMMAND    PROGRAM NEEDED BY SPY TO ISSUE OPERATOR COMMANDS VIA
                SVC 34

  4. MFSSIGN    THIS MEMBER CONTAINS SOURCE STATEMENTS FOR THE MFS
                SIGNON MODULE. I'M NOT AN IMS PERSON SO I'M NOT SURE
                HOW TO CONSTRUCT IT, BUT HOWEVER YOU DO IT, CALL IT
                'SIGN'. IF YOU DON'T LIKE THAT NAME, CHANGE THE USER-
                MOD FOR THE TWO IMS MODULES TO WHATEVER YOU WISH TO
                CALL IT.

  5. USS3270L   THIS MEMBER CONTAINS SOURCE STATEMENTS FOR THE VTAM
                USS TABLE WE USE FOR LOCAL 3270'S (NON-SNA). THIS
                SCREEN APPEARS AS SOON AS THE TERMINAL CONNECTS TO
                VTAM. WE MADE IT APPEAR LIKE AN SPF MASTER MENU WHERE
                THE USER SIMPLY KEYS IN ONE LETTER TO CONNECT TO THE
                APPLICATION HE/SHE WISHES TO USE. IT LOOKS GOOD ON
                3278'S WITH SOME OF THE FIELDS HIGHLIGHTED AND EVEN
                BETTER ON 3279'S CAUSE IT'S IN RED, WHITE AND BLUE.

  6. USS3270R   THIS MEMBER CONTAINS SOURCE STATEMENTS FOR THE VTAM
                USS TABLE WE USE FOR SNA 3270'S . THE FORMAT OF THIS
                SCREEN IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT THAN THE LOCAL USSTAB
                BECAUSE YOU CAN'T USE THE SAME CONTROL CHARACTERS FOR
                SNA AS YOU WOULD FOR NON-SNA. HOWEVER THE SPF MENU
                CONCEPT IS THE SAME.

  7. SPY        THIS MEMBER IS THE SOURCE FOR SPY VERSION 3.1 WITH
                CROSS MEMORY SUPPORT INCLUDED FOR MVS/SP 1.3. THE VAST
                MAJORITY OF THE XM CODE CAME FROM THE BANK OF NEW SOUTH
                WALES. I SIMPLY FIT IT INTO THIS VERSION AND ADDED THE
                GETMAIN/FREEMAIN STUFF. THE SP3 CODE IS COMMENTED WITH
                'SP3'. ALSO, SOME OF THE SP3 CODE ONLY RELATES TO OUR
                SHOP SINCE WE DO OUR OWN AUTHORIZATION SETTING WITH AN
                SVC.

  8. OLDSPY     CBT ADDED THIS MODULE. IT CONTAINS THE SPY THAT CAME
                FROM THE BANK OF NEW SOUTH WALES FROM WHICH THE ABOVE
                WAS BUILT. IT IS ONLY FOR MVS/SP1.3 AND USES THE
                INTERNAL READER TO ISSUE OPERATOR COMMANDS RATHER THAN
                USE SVC 34 AS THE ABOVE DOES

  HERE'S A WORD OF ADVICE. IF YOU INSTALL THE MOD TO IMS, AND YOU ARE
  IN THE HABIT OF ISSUEING AN 'OPEN NODE ALL' COMMAND FROM IMS WHEN
  THE SYSTEM COMES UP, YOU MAY EXPERIENCE NCP SLOWDOWNS. THIS IS BE-
  CAUSE AS IMS CONNECTS TO THESE TERMINALS THE MOD WILL FORCE THE
  24X80 'SIGN' SCREEN TO BE SENT TO EVERY 3270 ON YOUR IMS NETWORK.
  TO GET AROUND THIS PROBLEM, DON'T OPEN ALL THE NODES. IN OUR CASE,
  WE STILL HAD TO OPEN THE PRINTER NODES SO WE SET UP AN NCCF CLIST
  THAT JUST TAKES CARE OF THE PRINTERS.  GOOD LUCK!
