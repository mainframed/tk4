//* FLOATING STORAGE FENCE (NON MVSSE).
//* THIS STRATEGY DIFFERS FROM OTHER STORAGE FENCING IN THAT THE
//* NUMBER OF FENCED PAGE FRAMES VARIES WITH THE DEMAND (AS MEASURED
//* BY UIC) OF THE PROTECTED ADDRESS SPACE. AS ITS PRIVATE UIC DROPS
//* STEAL IS INHIBITED AND MORE FRAMES ARE PROTECTED. AS IT IDLES
//* UIC RISES AND STEAL RESUMES, RETURNING MORE OF ITS FRAMES TO THE
//* PAGE FRAME POOL FOR USE BY OTHER ADDRESS SPACES.
//* ANOTHER KEY DIFFERENCE IS THAT THIS MOD EXCLUDES THE PROTECTED
//* ADDRESS SPACE FROM SYSTEM-WIDE HIGH UIC CALCULATION, ENABLING
//* SRM TO CONTINUE TO USE UIC IN ADJUSTING SYSTEM MPL.
