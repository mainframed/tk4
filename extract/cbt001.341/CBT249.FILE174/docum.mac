          VERSION 3       7/20/77

  THIS SET OF PROGRAMS WILL PERFORM THE FOLLOWING FUNCTIONS:

     1. COLLECT PSW SAMPLES FOR ROUTINES IN THE LINK PACK
        AREA (PSWSAMP).  THIS IS NOT THE RECOMMENDED COLLECTION
        PROGRAM.  THE RECOMMENDED APPROACH IS USING YALE'S
        STATDIE AND OURMF PROGRAMS TO COLLECT THE DATA.  THESE
        ROUTINES DO A MUCH BETTER JOB AT LESS OVERHEAD AND
        COLLECT SUFFICIENT INFORMATION TO DO PROGRAM PACKING
        ALSO.

     2. MAP THE LINK PACK AREA AND PRODUCE A SEQUENTIAL FILE
        OF MODULE STARTING ADDRESSES AND LENGTHS (DIRECT).

     3. PSEUDO-MAP THE LINK PACK AREA FROM THE DIRECTORY OF
        THE PDS "SYS1.LPALIB" AND PRODUCE A SEQUENTIAL FILE
        OF MODULE PSEUDO-STARTING ADDRESSES AND LENGTHS (LPAMAP).

     4. PSEUDO-MAP A LOAD MODULE FROM THE CESD ENTRIES IN THE
        LOAD MODULE AND PRODUCE A SEQUENTIAL FILE OF CSECT
        RELATIVE STARTING ADDRESSES AND LENGTHS (MODMAP).

     5. TAKE INFORMATION COLLECTED FROM OURMF (CONTACT YALE)
        AND POST PROCESS IT BY LPA MODULE, PROGRAM MODULE, OR
        STRAIGHT LPA MAPPING FUNCTIONS (OMFPST4).  ONE COULD
        DO LPA MODULE PACKING BY USING THE OUTPUT OF PSWSAMP
        AND THE DIRECT PROGRAM, BUT THIS IS NOT SUPPLIED SINCE
        WE NOW DO OUR OWN SAMPLING VIA OURMF AND STATDIE.

     6. PRODUCE A FILE OF COUNTS PER CSECT OR MODULE FROM THE
        OUTPUT OF THE PSWSAMP ROUTINE OR THE OURMF POST PROCESSOR
        (OMFPST4).

     7. PRODUCE SYS1.PARMLIB(IEAPAK00) CONTROL CARDS OR LINKAGE
        EDITOR CONTROL CARDS TO REPACK THE MODULES IN THE LPA
        OR THE CSECTS IN A LOAD MODULE (ANALYSIS).

USER CONTROL INPUT:

  ONLY TWO OF THE ROUTINES HAVE CONTROLLING INPUT PARAMETERS:

  OMFPST4: INPUT SPECIFIED EITHER IN SYSIN OR IN PARM FIELD
   CONTROL OPERANDS ARE:

       START(YYDDD,HHMMSS)   STARTING DATE AND TIME
       END(YYDDD,HHMMSS)     ENDING DATE AND TIME
       HOURS(HHMMSS,HHMMSS)  TIME PERIOD DURING THE DAY

           AND ONE OF THE FOLLOWING PARAMETERS

       LPA(MAP)   PRODUCE OUTPUT FOR PACKING THE LPA
       PGM(PGMNAME)  PRODUCE OUTPUT FOR PACKING A PROGRAM
       MOD(MODULE)  PRODUCE OUTPUT FOR PACKING AN LPA MODULE

  ANALYSIS: INPUT SPECIFIED IN PARM FIELD
   CONTROL OPERANDS AREA:

       PACK      PRODUCE CARDS FOR "SYS1.PARMLIB(IEAPAK00)"
       LINK(MODULE)  PRODUCE CARDS FOR THE RE-LINK EDIT OF
                     THE SPECIFIED MODULE
   SYSIN INPUT TO ANALYSIS IS AS FOLLOWS:

    ZERO M1,M2,M3,...,MN  ZERO THE USE FACTORS FOR THE SPECIFIED
          MODULES/CSECTS.  USEFUL WHEN DECEPTIVELY HIGH COUNTS
          WOULD MISLEAD THE PACKING ALGORITHM.  WE USE IT
          TO ZERO COUNTS FOR THE ALTERNATE JES SSSM'S.

    EQUATE M1,M2,M3,...,MN  EQUATE THE USE FACTORS FOR THE SPECIFED
           MODULES/CSECTS.  USEFUL FOR PURE DATA MODULES WHICH WOULD
           NOT GET PSW SAMPLES.  THIS WAY THEY CAN BE ASSOCIATED
           WITH THEIR PROPER CODE MODULES.

    PACK M1,M2,M3,...,MN  PACK THE SPECIFIED MODULES/CSECTS TOGETHER.
           THE ANALYSIS PROGRAM DOES NO VALIDITY CHECKING OF THE
           MODULES (CONCERNING LENGTHS, ETC.) AND MERELY PRODUCES
           THE MODULES AS ONE PACK GROUP.  YOU SHOULD FOLLOW THE
           RULES SPECIFIED IN INITIALIZATION AND TUNING GUIDE
           FOR PACKING MODULES.  USEFUL FOR RMF AND MF1 SYSTEMS
           WHICH FIX MODULES WHEN THEY ARE RUNNING.

THERE ARE FOUR SETS OF JCL IN THE PACKAGE WHICH ARE:

    JCLBTAPE: BUILD A TAPE OF THE LPA DIRECTORY AND MODULE COUNTS
    JCLATAPE: ANALYSE THE TAPE WITH A CHANGED LPA TO PRODUCE NEW
              NEW PACKING CARDS (USEFUL WITH SELECTABLE UNIT OR
              PROGRAM UPTAPE TAPE INSTALLATIONS).
    JCLLPA: REPACK THE LPA
    JCLMOD: RELINK A PROGRAM OR MODULE WITHIN THE LPA

THE ORIGINAL IDEA OF THIS PACKAGE CAME FROM THE GERRARD BANK PACKER
PROGRAM, BUT WE HAVE PROGRESSES SIGNIFICANTLY PAST THOSE BEGINNINGS.
