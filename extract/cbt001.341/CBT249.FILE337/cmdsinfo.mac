*        THIS IS A VERSION OF THE COMMAND SUB-SYSTEM WHICH         *
*        WORKS WITH JES3 AND, INDEED, WILL ALSO WORK WITH JES2.    *
*        THE MODULES INCLUDED HERE ARE THE SUB-SYSTEM ITSELF,      *
*        (MODULES CMDSINIT, CMDSMAIN, AND CMDSROUT) AND TWO        *
*        COMMAND PROCESSORS - IEESQ03D, WHICH INTERROGATES THE ENQ *
*        CHAIN AND OUTPUTS MESSAGES RELATED TO ENQ AND RESERVE     *
*        LOCKOUTS, AND IEESK03D WHICH OUTPUTS THE SRM'S 'RCT' TABLE*
*        AND INDICATES CPU UTILIZATION, SYSTEM PAGING, AND TSO     *
*        RESPONSE BY PERFORMANCE GROUP.                            *
*        THIS VERSION OF THE SUB-SYSTEM, WITH THE EXCEPTION        *
*        OF THE ROUTER MODULE (CMDSROUT) IS NOT, NOR DOES IT       *
*        NEED TO BE RE-ENTRANT. THE ROUTER MODULE STACKS MULTIPLE  *
*        COMMANDS IN AN AREA OF CSA POINTED TO BY A CELL IN THE    *
*        SSCVT. WHEN THE MODULE CMDSMAIN GETS CONTROL AS A RESULT  *
*        OF BEING POSTED BY THE ROUTER, ALL THE STACKED COMMANDS   *
*        ARE EXECUTED.                                             *
*                                                                  *
*        INSTALLATION OF THIS SYSTEM IS SIMPLE :                   *
*          1. FIND THE NEXT EMPTY ENTRY IN THE SUB-SYSTEM TABLE    *
*             (IEFJSSNT) AND DO THE FOLLOWING SUPERZAP :           *
*                                                                  *
*            //  EXEC  PGM=AMASPZAP                                *
*            //SYSPRINT  DD  SYSOUT=A                              *
*            //SYSLIB  DD  DSN=SYS1.LINKLIB,DISP=SHR               *
*            //SYSIN  DD  *                                        *
*              NAME  IEFJSSNT  IEFJSSNT                            *
*              VER 00XX  00000000,00000000,00000000,00000000       *
*              REP 00XX  C3D4C4E2,C3D4C4E2,C9D5C9E3                *
*            /*                                                    *
*      (THIS IS :        C M D S  C M D S  I N I T    )            *
*                                                                  *
*             THIS TELLS MVS THAT THE NAME OF THE SUB-SYSTEM IS    *
*             "CMDS" AND THE INITIALIZATION ROUTINE FOR THE SUB    *
*             SYSTEM IS "CMDSINIT".                                *
*          2. ASSEMBLE THE ROUTER MODULE "CMDSROUT" AND LINK IT    *
*             TO SYS1.LPALIB. ASSEMBLE ALL THE OTHERS (CMDSMAIN,   *
*             CMDSINIT, IEESK03D, AND IEESQ03D) AND LINK THEM TO   *
*             SYS1.LINKLIB. ALL MODULES SHOULD BE LINKED AC=(1).   *
*          3. IPL YOUR SYSTEM WITH A 'CLPA' AND YOU ARE IN         *
*             BUSINESS.                                            *
*                                                                  *
*        SOME NOTES ABOUT THIS SUB-SYSTEM :                        *
*          1. THIS SYSTEM CONTAINS AN ESTAE WITH RETRY, SO IF ANY  *
*             COMMAND BOMBS, (WHICH THEY WILL DO ON OCCASION DUE   *
*             TO SYSTEM IDIOSYNCRACIES) A SYSTEM DUMP WILL BE      *
*             TAKEN AND COMPLETE RECOVERY WILL BE EFFECTED.        *
*             --- YOU MIGHT WANT TO CHANGE ONE OF THE WTO'S IN     *
*                 CMDSMAIN; IT SAYS TO NOTIFY JIM WHEATON IF THE   *
*                 SUB-SYSTEM DUMPS. THIS MIGHT CONFUSE YOUR        *
*                 OPERATIONS PERSONNEL.                            *
*          2. ALL OF THE OTHER COMMANDS OF THE STANDARD #COMMAND   *
*             SUB-SYSTEM MAY BE MODIFIED TO WORK UNDER THIS SYSTEM.*
*             LOOK AT THE 'Q' COMMAND (IEESQ03D) AND THE CHANGES   *
*             SHOULD BE OBVIOUS. SOME OF THE CHANGES ARE:          *
*             A. R8 IS USED AS THE MESSAGE POINTER INSTEAD OF R2.  *
*             B. THE UCMID IS EXTRACTED FROM THE SSOB AND IS       *
*                POINTED TO BY R8, IE. ALL THE SVC 35 CALLING      *
*                SEQUENCES MUST BE CHANGED.                        *
*           3. SINCE THE POUND SIGN (#) IS A JES3 RECOGNIZED       *
*              SYMBOL, THIS SUB-SYSTEM WORKS OFF THE COLON (:).    *
*              THIS MAY BE CHANGED IF YOU FIND THE COLON           *
*              OBJECTIONABLE. JES3 USERS NOTE THAT YOU MUST FIND   *
*              A CHARACTER WHICH IS NOT JES3 ORIENTED.             *
*            4. THE ORIGINAL #CMD SUB-SYSTEM HAS STRANGE MODULE    *
*               NAMING CONVENTIONS, EG. #N = IEESA03D,             *
*               #C = IEESE03D, ETC. THIS SYSTEM REQUIRES NAMING    *
*               THE MODULES FOR CONSISTANCY, IE. :Q = IEESQ03D,    *
*               :N = IEESN03D, :A = IEESA03D, ETC.                 *
*            5. THIS SUB-SYSTEM HAS BEEN UPGRADED TO RUN ON        *
*               MVS/SE2 AND MVS/SP1. CONTROL BLOCK MODIFICATIONS   *
*               ARE NECESSARY FOR USE UNDER ANY LOWER MVS LEVEL.   *
*            6. WE, AT EXXON, HAVE MANY MORE COMMANDS THAT WE      *
*               FIND VERY USEFUL FOR PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS AND      *
*               SYSTEM TROUBLE SHOOTING. THESE HAVE NOT BEEN       *
*               INCLUDED DUE TO A LACK OF PERCEPTION ON OUR PART   *
*               AS TO THE UNIVERSALITY OF THEIR APPEAL AND THEIR   *
*               CROSS CONTENTION WITH THE #CMDS SUB-SYSTEM.        *
*               ANY OR ALL OF THESE ROUTINES MAY BE OBTAINED BY    *
*               CONTACTING :                                       *
*                                                                  *

*                'STATDIE' BE INCLUDED IN YOUR SYSTEM.             *
*                STATDIE AND :T ARE VERY USEFUL FOR CATCHING CPU   *

*                SPECIFIC DEVICE. YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW USEFUL THIS *
*                COMMAND CAN BE FOR SYSTEM RECOVERY FROM MISSING   *
*                INTERRUPTS ON SHARED DEVICES !!!!!!!!!            *
*         ***** NOTE !!!!!!!!                                      *

*        DO NOTE THAT MANY OF OUR COMMANDS HAVE IMBEDDED CODE THAT *
*        ENABLES THEM TO BE EXECUTED UNDER TSO. SOME OF THESE NEED *
