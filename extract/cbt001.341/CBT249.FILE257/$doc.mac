     THIS MATERIAL CONSISTS OF FOUR ELEMENTS:
            1. THE RMF INTERVAL EXIT
            2. A MOD TO VTAM TO CLEAR HWM STATS
            3. A PROGRAM TO PRINT THE STATS RECORD WRITTEN
               BY THE RMF INTERVAL EXIT
            4. A PROGRAM TO PRINT THE NCP TUNING
               STATISTICS RECORD WRITTEN TO SMF BY VTAM


 1.  ERBMFDUC MUST BE ASSEMBLED AND LINKEDITED INTO LINKLIB.
     REFER TO RMF REFERENCE AND USERS GUIDE (GC28-0922) FOR
     FURTHER DETAILS.
 2.  THE VTAM MOD IS AT PUT 80-01 LEVEL. IT MUST BE APPLIED
     IF YOU WANT THE HWM STATS CLEARED  (NOT MANDATORY).
 3.  THE PROGRAM TO PRINT THE BUFFER STATISTICS CAN BE RUN
     FROM ANY LIBRARY. NO SPECIAL AUTHORIZATION OR ATTRIBUTES
     ARE REQUIRED. RECORD TYPE 78 WAS USED FOR THE BUFFER
     STATS. IF YOU ALREADY HAVE A TYPE 78, YOU WILL NEED TO
     CHANGE IT TO SOMETHING ELSE.
 4.  THE TUNING STATS PRINT PROGRAM JUST PRINTS THE VTAM
     GENERATED SMF RECORD CONTENTS. NO SPECIAL MACROS OR
     AUTHORIZATION IS REQUIRED.
