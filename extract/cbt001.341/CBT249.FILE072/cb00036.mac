* IBM IN ITS INFINITE WISDOM HAS CORRECTED THIS APAR (QUESTION MARK)
* BY GIVING YOU A PARM FIELD TO SPECIFY SO AS TO BYPASS THE 19
* IDR RECORD CHECK THE ONLY THING WRONG IS THAT NO ONE TOLD
* THE SMP GROUP SO THERE IS STILL A PROBLEM WITH SMP AND 19
* IDR RECORDS
*
* SMP FAILS TO APPLY S/ZAP FIXES, EVEN WHEN FORCE IS
* SPECIFIED, IF THE SMP-SUPPLIED AND INVOKED VERSION
* OF SUPERZAP FINDS ALL 19 IDRDATA SPACES
* EXHAUSTED. THIS MAKES SUCCESSFUL USE OF THE FORCE
* FEATURE OF SMP CONDITIONAL AND PLACES IDRDATA
* INTEGRITY AT A HIGHER PRIORITY THAN SYSTEM INTEGRITY.
*
* THIS IS A RESTRICTION TO SUPERZAP BUT IN THE
* INTERIM, INVOKING SMP WITH JOBLIB TO ANOTHER COPY
* OF SUPERZAP WITH THE ATTACHED ZAP APPLIED
* WILL PROVIDE THE NECESSARY CAPABILITY.
*
* THIS ZAP IS A RETROFIT FROM VS2 RELEASE 1.7 AY07509
