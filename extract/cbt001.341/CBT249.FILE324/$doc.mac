 1) TSOENQ - (TSO CP)

       FUNCTION - DISPLAY DATASET ENQUE CONFLICTS ON SP1.3 SYSTEM.

       COMMAND SYNTAX - TSOENQ

       NOTE - THIS CODE HAS NOT BEEN TESTED WITH A GRS RING.
              SCOPE=GLOBAL WILL HAVE TO BE SPECIFIED ON THE GQSCAN MACRO
              AND THE GQSCAN HAS TO RUN AUTHORIZED KEY ZERO.

              GET THE CORRECT SYSTEM NAME IN THE 'SYSTEM' FIELD,
              OTHERWISE (NONA) NONAME WILL BE DISPLAYED.

       NOTE - FOR A SYSTEM WITH MANY DATASETS IN USE, THE "SCANAREA"
              MIGHT HAVE TO BE MADE LARGER.  IF IT IS THE CORRESPONING
              FIELD ON THE "AREA" PARAMETER OF THE "GQSCAN" MACRO MUST
              BE CHANGED.

       NOTE - THIS CODE HAS NOT BEEN TESTED WITH A GRS RING.
              SCOPE=GLOBAL WILL HAVE TO BE SPECIFIED ON THE GQSCAN MACRO
              AND THE GQSCAN HAS TO RUN AUTHORIZED KEY ZERO.

       NOTE - THE 'SYSNAME' IN IEASYS00 SHOULD SPECIFY YOUR SMFID TO
              GET THE CORRECT SYSTEM NAME IN THE 'SYSTEM' FIELD,
