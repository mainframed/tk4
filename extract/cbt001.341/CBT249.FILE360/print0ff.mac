)F FUNCTION -
   THE PRINTOFF COMMAND CAN BE USED TO OBTAIN HARDCOPY OF DATA SETS
   THROUGH FOREGROUND COPYING TO SYSOUT.  THE COMMAND PRINTS A
   DATASET(S) WHICH IS SEQUENTIAL OR PARTITIONED, BLOCKED OR UNBLOCKED,
   WITH FIXED OR VARIABLE RECORD LENGTH LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 256 (255
   IF WITHOUT CARRIAGE CONTROL).

)O OPERANDS -
))'DSLIST'  - 'DATA SET LIST' CONTAINS THE NAMES OF DATA SETS TO BE
              PRINTED OR PUNCHED.  THE NAMES SHOULD FOLLOW TSO
              CONVENTION,  IN QUOTES IF THE PRIMARY INDEX DIFFERS FROM
              YOUR USERID, OR WITHOUT QUOTES AND WITH THE PRIMARY
              INDEX OMITTED IF IT IS THE SAME AS YOUR USERID.

))ARR(###)  - IF THE OUTPUT IS BEING ROUTED TO A 6670 DEVICE YOU CAN USE
              THE ARR PARAMETER TO SELECT A STORED 6670 ARRANGEMENT.
              WSRCC'S REMOTE 1 6670 HAS 5 STORED ARRANGEMENTS AVAILABLE
              FOR USE: 100, 101, 102, 103, AND 106. ARR(106) IS THE
              DEFAULT ARRANGEMENT, THIS ARRANGEMENT USES STORED FONT
              224, THE ROTATED FONT.  OUTPUT PRINTED WITH THIS
              ARRANGEMENT IS THE NORMAL 132 CHARACTER (13.3 CPI)
              COMPUTER OUTPUT ON 8 1/2" BY 11" PAPER PRINTED WIDTHWISE
              (LANDSCAPE). THE ONLY REASONS TO USE ARR(106) IS IF YOU
              DESIRE PAGE NUMBERING (SEE NUMBER), DUPLEXING (SEE
              DUPLEX), OR EXPRESS (SEE EXPRESS).  THE OTHER ARRANGEMENTS
              ARE USED FOR PRINTING LENGTHWISE ON 8 1/2" BY 11" PAPER.
