  This PDS contains several members. They are:

  1. $DOC       THIS IS IT.

  2. ASMCMD     This member is the JCL to assemble and linkedit
                COMMAND into a linklist library.

  3. ASMSPY     This member is the JCL to assemble and linkedit
                SPY into a linklist library.

  4. ASMSWP     This member is the JCL to assemble and linkedit
                SWAP into a linklist library.

  5. AUTH       This member is the source for AUTH macro to
                issue a user SVC that gets and releases
                program authorization for an assembler program.

  6. BEGIN      This member is the source for BEGIN macro to do
                standard entry linkage in assembler programs.

  7. COMMAND    This member is the source for COMMAND Version 2.0.  It
                was originally taken from a file on the CBT tape.  See
                the program documentation for additional comments
                about the origin of this code. COMMAND is used by SPY
                to issue operator commands via SVC 34.  I added the
                support for the BEGIN, FINISH and AUTH macros.

  8. DISIMAGE   IBM 3800 Printing Subsystem Support Utility.
                This member will allow you to create an IEBIMAGE source
                deck from any member of SYS1.IMAGELIB (except COPYMOD's)
                that was created by IEBIMAGE in the first place.

  9. DISKMAP    This member will list the contents of a VTOC in several
                usefull formats.  Original program was from CBT tape.
                This version has several changes including 3380 support.

 10. DTYP2UNT   This subroutine will convert a UCB-type hex device code
                to a valid unit name using the System Device Name Table.

 11. DYNAM      This subroutine is called by DYNAUTIL to do dynamic
                allocation as needed by it's driver.  Originally from
                the University of Manitoba.

 12. DYNAUTIL   DYNAUTIL is a reentrant, refreshable, and reusable
                Assembler language program that provides dynamic
                allocation for batch programs and utilities.  This is
                accomplished by passing control card images to the
                University of Manitoba's DYNAM SVC 99 interface.
                DYNAUTIL can run as a front-end to a batch task or can
                be called by a batch task during it's execution.

 13. DYNAUTLH   This is the documentation for the DYNAUTIL program.

 14. FINISH     This member is the source for FINISH macro to do
                standard exit linkage in assembler programs.

 15. IDCMSGEN   Access Method Services (IDCAMS) Support Utility.
                This program will allow you to create an IDCAMS source
                deck from most objects in your VSAM catalog.

 16. IEFACTRT   SMF exit that produces many usefull statistics and
                messages at step and job end.  These messages appear
                in an abbreviated form in the JOBLOG and in a more
                detailed form in the Job MESSAGES output.

 17. IEFU84     SMF exit that does a getmain for an area that becomes
                a local user CVT.  This area is mapped by WSRCCCVT.

 18. IGC0023C   A type 3 SCV that is invoked from the AUTH macro to
                authorize or un-authorize TSO commands, Programs, etc.

 19. ISPTCM     A macro (TCMGEN) and a module (ISPTCM) that replace
                the distributed ISPF module.  This macro and module
                were written in response to APAR OZ64211.  See
                INFO/MVS entry E130403 for particulars.

 10. LASTIPL    TSO command that uses the local user CVT mapped by
                WSRCCCVT to display when the system was IPLled.

 21. PRINTOFF   TSO command originally from the CBT tape and heavily
                modified for use at WSRCC has support for the 3800
                printing subsystem via CHARS, TRC, MODIFY, MODTRC,
                FLASH, FCOUNT, CGROUP and BRUST keywords.  Some
                problems with the 6670 code has also been fixed.

 22. PRINT0FF   TSO HELP for the modified PRINTOFF command.

 23. SPY        This member is the source for SPY Version 3.1 with
                Cross Memory Support included for MVS/SP 1.3. It was
                originally taken from file 338 on the CBT tape.  See
                the program documentation for additional comments
                about the origin of this code.  The vast majority of
                the XM code came from the Bank of New South Wales. I
                added the code to support the PFkeys in the 3270
                environmemt along with the BEGIN. FINISH and AUTH
                macros.

 24. SWAP       This member is the source for SWAP Version 4.5.  It
                was originally taken from a file on the CBT tape.  See
                the program documentation for additional comments
                about the origin of this code.  I added the support
                for the BEGIN, FINISH and AUTH macros.

 25. UADS       TSO command that will allow those users with operator
                ability to dynamically change their UADS entries in
                the PSCB.  Once changed, it will remain in effect
                across a relogon (unless using ACF2 in NOUADS mode).

 26. UADSHELP   TSO HELP for the UADS command.

 27. VOLS       TSO command to list free space on all or selected
                online DASD devices.  Volume selection includes
                DEVICETYPE, ATTRIBUTE, VOLUME and UCB.

 28. VOLSHELP   TSO HELP for the VOLS command.

 29. WSRCCCVT   Macro that maps the local user CVT that is gotten at
                IPL time by IEFU84.  A local user CVT is very usefull
                for many random uses, we find many for ours.

 30. ZSORTZ     This subroutine will sort an in-core table. Original
                source unknown (probably early 1970's SHARE tape (?)).

  WSRCC in no way assumes ANY responsibility for the use of ANY part
  of this code.  However, if you have any questions, feel free to call.
