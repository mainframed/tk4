SAFECOPY is a TSO command processor which enables many users to copy
data into the same dataset simultaneously without conflicting with
each other.  Input data may come from a dataset, from the terminal, or
from data stacked instream in a CLIST.

SAFECOPY is especially useful in CLISTs which write to a common
dataset.

SAFECOPY accomplishes this by performing a system enqueue before
writing to the dataset.  Major name is USERDSN, minor name is the name
of the dataset into which SAFECOPY is writing.

Input and output can be designated by dataset name, or by file/DD
name.  If the output dataset is not partitioned, the MOD operand will
cause the use of the EXTEND operand of OPEN, allowing data to be added
on to the end of a sequential dataset.

The default is NONUM.  The use of the NUM operand will cause the
physical relocation of line numbers when SAFECOPYing between variable
and fixed record length datasets, or between fixed record length
datasets of different logical record lengths.


This installation PDS contains of the following members:

        SAFECOPY - SAFECOPY command processor
            HELP - SAFECOPY HELP member, includes diagnostic messages

        LINKSAVE - Macro for linkage conventions
        LINKBACK - Macro for linkage conventions
            EQ$R - Macro for register equates
      * GTEDADOC - Documentation for GTEDA dynamic allocation macros
        GTEDADAT - Macro to build dynamic allocation control blocks
        GTEDASET - Macro to link dynalloc control blocks together
        GTEDAALC - Macro to execute SVC99 and DAIRFAIL

      * GTEDA macros are under development.  The functions used by
        SAFECOPY work correctly.  Other functions are not tested.

Assembly:
  1.  Place the macros in a maclib or instream.
  2.  Assemble with RENT.

Linkage Edit:
  1.  Link with RENT and REUS. Designate ALIAS(SAFEC).
  2.  SYSLMOD must be LPALIB (followed by IPL with CLPA), a member of
      a library named in LNKLST, or STEPLIB in the TSO logon
      procedure.
  3.  Load module length:  7960 bytes (1F18)

HELP:
  Place into the HELP dataset with an alias of SAFEC.

ACF2:
  If you use command limiting lists with the ACF2 Security and
  Control product, add SAFECOPY and SAFEC to the list of command
  names.
