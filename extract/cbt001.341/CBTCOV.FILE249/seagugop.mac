0Sprecher Energie AG only run two shifts, the night work is handled by O
 without an Operator being present. If Production jobs fail overnight ou
 OPC/A exit (see CBT File 172) will 'BLEEP' the duty Analyst who dials i
 TSO with a portable PC and tries to fix the problem. Thus if we don't h
 an alarm, we think that everything is OK.  On the night of 3-4 July 199
 nobody heard an alarm, but things were definitely not OK. One of our no
 3174 compatible controllers suffered some sort of aberration, and refus
 all BIND requests. VTAM issued the message set IST663I, IST664I, IST889
 IST314I describing the BIND FAILURE with SENSE=080A0000, an uncondition
 BIND Reject. VTAM immediately re-tried the BIND which was immediately
 refused in a sequence which went on throughout the night. Because VTAM
 at a high dispatching priority it tied up one hundred percent of the CP
 nothing else ran. Our online systems were three hours late starting the
 morning. Although this was the first time this failure had occured in f
 years of processing, it was so severe that we had to find some way to h
 it. There may well be some VTAM parameter to define the retry time, but
 VTAM expertise was not great enough to find it. We thought we could aut
 the handling of IST663I to forestall a repetition of this problem. The
 console automation tool we run is 'TSSO' Release 4.3 from File 401 of t
 CBT Tape Level 321. When we looked at the automation of messages IST663
 IST664I we ran into a basic problem; these messages are both data lines
 Multi-Line WTO, and TSSO cannot handle Multi-Line WTO's. We have modifi
 TSSO to be able to process these messages, and this paper documents the
 processing options.

 2.1.1   The Entry-Id Operand
+2.1.1   The Entry-Id Operand
0A significant change which can trap the unwary has nothing to do with M
 processing, but is designed to reduce the overhead of running TSSO.
 Previously TSSO would scan the entire AOF table for every message, even
 after a match had been found. We have changed this logic such that if a
 match is found, and_no_Entry_Id_is_provided, AOF processing for that me
+                ___ __ _____ __ __ ________
 will end without scanning the rest of the table. Note that this logic o
 works when a match is found, including any TEST operands. Several entri
 can be created for the same message with different TEST operands, and e
 will be processed until the TEST is matched. If there is no Entry-Id
 processing will stop at that point. Thus if the User wants more than on
 action to be performed on a message, Entry-Ids must be provided on each
 TABENTRY macro except the last. Example 1 shows this processing applied
 the IEF238D allocation recovery message. Only one of these entries will
 processed, depending on if and when the 'WAIT' option appears. Converse
 Example 2 shows two entries for a message which will both be processed
 IEA994A appears.
0Users installing these mods to TSSO should check their existing AOF tab
 to ensure that this condition is met, because it is a change which is n
 downwards compatible.

 2.1.2   The TEXT Operand
+2.1.2   The TEXT Operand
0In vanilla TSSO it is legal to code a 'TEXT=' operand where it makes no
 sense, even when ACTION=POST is coded. An entry with this combination w
 overwrite the AOF table in storage when triggered, the results of which
 unpredictable. We encountered this problem during testing when we chang
 AOF table entry to 'ACTION=POST' without deleting all the previous oper
 Therefore logic has been added to the TABENTRY macro to generate an MNO
 for this error and to ignore the TEXT operand.

 2.1.3   The TEST Operand
+2.1.3   The TEST Operand
0Sprecher Energie have added a new test with the form 'L,nn' where 'nn'
 the Line Number which must match the count of the current line of a
 Multi-Line WTO. Any tests previous to the 'L,nn' operand will only be
 performed on the first line. If this operand is specified for messages
 are not Multi-Line WTO's an error message will be generated when the Ta
 entry is triggered. If this test is satisfied it has important
 consequencies. All subsequent processing for this AOF Table entry will
 performed on the specified Line Number of the Multi-Line WTO. This mean

-that data from the previous line(s) cannot be incorporated in TEXT
 specifications, only data from the specified line.  If further tests ar
 specified they only be applied to the specified line, not to any previo
 line, including the first. Because the line number being processed is a
 operand of TEST, it does not make sense to have more than one 'L,nn' op
 - such tests will always fail. Example 3 shows an entry for the multi l
 VTAM error message IST663I. In this case the first line will be tested
 particular Status indicators, then processing will be switched to the s
 line to pick up the LU Name for the TEXT.

 2.1.4   The ACTION Operand
+2.1.4   The ACTION Operand
0Sprecher Energie have introduced the option 'ACTION=NONE', which is
 analogous to IEFBR14 for batch jobs. As it suggests, it terminates
 processing for the entry at that point without actually doing anything.
 However, in conjunction with the new Entry-Id processing it may be used
 restrict the processing performed on frequently occurring messages to
 conserve resource utilisation. Example 4 shows the entry for IST663I
 previously shown in Example 3, but with an additional entry that will
 prevent TSSO from running through the entire AOF Table for every line o
 multi-line message IST663I. Unconditional BIND failure messages will be
 handled by the first entry, every other error will stop at the second e

 have two points of control for message suppression, so we added a small
 check in AOF processing for MPF suppressed messages. If true, AOF stopp
 that point. Now the MPF list becomes the most important message suppres
 mechanism, as it should be. If you want to process a message with TSSO,
 remove it from the MPF list (if you use LOGAN from CBT file270 you may
 to leave it in with SUP(NO)). The message is then eligible for AOF
 processing, which may itself suppress the message.

+4.   THEORY OF OPERATION
+     ______ __ _________
0To get the most from the Sprecher Energie mods it helps to understand h
 AOF works. The Communications Task builds a copy of each WQE in CSA bef
 branching to the Sub-System Exit (HASPEXIT). The Sub-System Interface p
 each eligible Sub-System via SSI Code 09 (WTO Communication) the addres
 the normal WQE for single line WTO's. For multi-line WTO's it may pass
 address of the Major WQE with no Minor WQE on the first call, or both a
 Major and Minor WQE address on subsequent calls. However, it is importa
 remember that these addresses are those of the dummy WQE in CSA, not th
 real WQE in the Comms Task address space. This may change in MVS/ESA 4.
 where WTL's at least are created in ECSA. They may still be copied to C
 for the Sub-System Interface, that information is not available at the
 of writing.
0One eligible Sub-System is TSSO, and the module TSSOSS09 handles this
 function. It has three distinct segments, but we are only concerned wit
 last one, which is WQE processing. After checking that MPF has not
 suppressed this message, it separates the message number, or at least t
 first eight characters of the data. This in itself can cause problems,
 because the Comms Task shuffles the message about a bit to put in vario
 flags depending on whether it is issued by an Authorised program or not
 Assuming it has got the right message identifier, it starts to scan the
 table for this message, or for a generic message processing entry with
 specified as the message identifier. If a match is found for one of the
 two tests, it goes on to process the 'TEST=' operands. If the tests are
 satisfied it tests that MATCHLIM has not been reached and then performs
 'ACTION' specified. Standard TSSO Release 4.3 will then go round to tes
 remaining entries in the AOF table. However, it will only perform WQE
 processing for Normal WQE's and for Major WQE's with no Minor. It will
 ignore subsequent calls for each Minor WQE of the Major.
0A fundamental change is that the Sprecher Energie version will process
 and every non MPF-suppressed WQE, whether it is Normal, Major or Minor.
 Normal WQE processing is much as before, therefore I will concentrate o
 Multi-Line WTO's. The message number is always extracted from the Major
 so for example it is not possible to define processing for the specific
 message number IST664I because that number appears in a Minor WQE. If a
 specific or generic entry is found in the AOF table processing continue
 with the TEST operands, if any. If there are none there is a danger tha
 ACTION specified will be performed for every line of the multi-line WTO
 which is probably not required - be careful. Tests are carried out on t
 Major WQE until the 'L,nn' operand is detected. It would be nice to run
 chain of Minor WQE's, but unless you care to write the code to go cross
 memory into the Comms Task address space you cannot do that, so our cod
 uses data areas in the AOF table to keep a count of the number of times
 has been entered for this Major WQE. When this count matches the Line N
 specified as a TEST, all subsequent processing switches to the text in
 Minor WQE.  This includes any further tests and all ACTION processing.
 does mean that you cannot mix data from the Major and the Minor WQE's i
 TEXT specification. If this is not the Line Number required the TEST fa

 and TSSO will continue to run up the AOF table looking for a match on t
 message number (of the Major WQE) or for generic ('*') entries. It is t
 handle this situation that we added the 'ACTION=NONE' operand.
