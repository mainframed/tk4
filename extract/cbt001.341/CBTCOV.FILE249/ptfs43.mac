-----------------------------------------------------------------------
THIS FILE IS A LIST OF ALL PTFS THAT ARE APPLIED TO THE 4.3 RELEASE
OF TSSO. THESE PTFS ARE INCLUDED IN YOUR SOURCE, AND THIS FILE
IS FOR YOUR INFORMATION ONLY.
----------------------------------------------------------------------


PTF NUMBER: PTF1

MODULES AFFECTED: TSSODOCM

USERS AFFECTED: THOSE ISSUING LARGE AMOUNTS OF TSO COMMANDS THROUGHOUT
                THE DAY.

SYMPTOMS:
   TSSO ABENDING ON AN 80A OR 40D. SINCE THE ESTAE ROUTINE IS NOT
   INVOKED FOR THESE ABENDS, MVS WILL START TAKING RECURSIVE
   SUBSYSTEM ERRORS IN MASTER SUBSYSTEM BROADCAST FUNCTION.

CAUSE:
   THE PROBLEM IS CAUSED BY THE TERMINAL MONITOR PROGRAM NOT FREEING
   ALL STORAGE THAT IT OBTAINS. IT OBTAINS ABOUT 8K OF STORAGE AT THE
   JOB STEP LEVEL. IT DEPENDS ON MVS TASK TERMINATION TO FREE THIS
   STORAGE. SINCE TSSO WAS NOT INVOKING THE TMP AS A JOB STEP, 8K
   OF STORAGE WOULD DISAPPEAR WITH EACH INVOCATION OF THE TMP.

FIX:
   TSSODOCM WAS CHANGED TO ATTACH IKJEFT01 AS A JOB STEP RATHER THEN
   A NORMAL TASK.

PTF NUMBER: PTF2

MODULES AFFECTED: TSSOESTA

USERS AFFECTED: THOSE CANCELLING TSSO WHILE THE TMP HAS CONTROL.

SYMPTOMS:
   TSSO ABENDING ON AN S222 WITH THE ESTAE GETTING CONTROL IN A
   DEAUTHORIZED STATE. MESSAGE TSSE451I IS PRECEDED BY A '+' SIGN
   INDICATING THIS CONDITION. SINCE THE ESTAE IS NOT ABLE TO CLEAN
   UP, THE SUBSYSTEM INTERFACE HOOKS DO NOT GET DELETED, BUT THE
   MODULES THEMSELVES DO. MVS WILL THEN START TAKING RECURSIVE
   SUBSYSTEM ABENDS IN THE MASTER SUBSYSTEM BROADCAST
   FUNCTIONS.

CAUSE:
   THE PROBLEM IS CAUSED BY THE TERMINAL MONITOR PROGRAM DEAUTHORIZING
   THE ADDRESS SPACE UPON ENTRY. SINCE THE TMP PERCOLATES THE ABEND
   CAUSED BY THE MVS CANCEL COMMAND, THE AUTHORIZATION IS NEVER RESET.
   THIS CAUSED THE ESTAE ROUTINE TO GET CONTROL UNAUTHORIZED.

FIX:
   TSSOESTA IS MODIFIED TO CHECK IF IT WAS INVOKED AUTHORIZED. IF IT
   IS NOT, TSSOESTA DOES A PC TO TSSO CROSS MEMORY SERVICES ROUTINE TO
   ALLOW IT TO GAIN APF AUTHORIZATION.
