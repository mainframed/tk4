This is the result of the combination of different sets of changes to
the base TSSO 4.3 that have been made at a number of sites. The main
modifications are from Mr. Dave Cartwright of SPRECHER ENERGIE AG. His
modifications deal with additional capabilities for the AOF table,
mainly the processing of Multi-line WTOs.  These changes allow the
processing of secondary lines of any MLWTO.  At BFGoodrich we have
included that code with other small modifications brought forward from
TSSO 4.2. This document represents the current state of the TSSO 4.3+
product.

This document supersedes both the original 4.3 user guide (US43xxxx)
and the SPRECHER document (SEAGUGxx) in how messages are processed via
the AOF table.


*****   AOF Table Processing.

The original 4.3 processing of the AOF table was as follows:
  -Sequential search of the table processing any matches as found.
  -Entire table searched for each message.
  -Minor WQEs ignored (second and following lines in MLWTO).

SEAG processing of the AOF table was as follows:
  -Sequential search of the table till a match was found with no
   entry ID. All matches were processed as found.
  -Major and minor WQEs processed.

TSSO 4.3+ processing of the AOF table is as follows:
  -When table is loaded (or reloaded) a binary search index is
   created based on the MSG= parameter. All identical entries are
   changed together. All MSG=* entries are changed together.
  -Major and minor WQEs processed.
  -For each message processed, the binary index is searched and if
   found, the chained entries are all processed. All messages are
   also passed to all MSG=* entries.

The advantage that SEAG gained in speed is preserved in 4.3+ and the
original processing order from 4.3 is preserved in 4.3+ without
modification of the AOF table.

The only apparent difference is that the MSG=* entries are not
processed in the physical order of the source table. They are processed
after all matching entries are processed.


****    Other Modifications

OSCMD
1.  Added preliminary support for REXX execs (SYSAUTH_MAXCMDOUT,
    SYSAUTH_CMDWAIT).
2.  Support hardware system console (CONSID=100).

REPLY, REPLYLOA
1.  Added return code to indicate results of REPLY command
      0 = reply successful
      4 = reply not outstanding
      8 = error in command processing
2.  Add support for IDMS processing (like IMS). Current syntax is
             IMS(cccccccc)
      REPLY  MSG(mmmmmmmm)    TEXT(tttttttt...)
             IDMS(vvvvvvvv)

    where vvvvvvvv is the IDMS CV string (usually V1, or V18, etc.)
3.  Support hardware system console (CONSID=100).

TSSO
1.  Cancel ESTAE when terminating.
2.  Support hardware system console (CONSID=100).
3.  Support binary search index creation.

TSSOCCMD
1.  Support hardware system console (CONSID=100).
2.  Support binary search index recreation.

TSSO, TSSOINI2
1.  Add new PARMLIB statement:
      MPFSUPP = Y/N
    To indicate whether MPF suppressed messages should be ignored by
    TSSO. The default is No. This results in operation compatible
    with previous versions of TSSO.

TSSOLAOF
1.  New module. Responsible for loading AOF table and building binary
    search index.

TSSOSS09
1.  Correctly clear output token array.
2.  Correctly lowlight eventual action messages.
3.  Support the MPFSUPP parameter statement.

TSSOSS10
1.  Support hardware support console (CONSID=100).

Numerous modules
1.  Change access to AOF table entries to use new DSECTS.
