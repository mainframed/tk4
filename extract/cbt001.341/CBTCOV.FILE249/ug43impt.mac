°          The Time Sharing Subsystem Option (TSSO) is a package designe
°          increase operator productivity by automating tasks which need
°          be performed manually. TSSO performs its function  through  t
°          integrated  components.  The Operator Productivity Facility (
°          extends the power of TSO to the MVS operator's console.  The
°          tomated  Operations  Facility  (AOF)  enhances  an installati
°          ability to control system events based on console  message  t
°          fic.   An interface to the Network Communication Control Faci
°          (NCCF) allows the network operator  to  use  TSSO  as  a  com
°          processor, issuing and receiving operating system commands at
°          NCCF  terminal.   TSSO also enhances end-user productivity by
°          lowing end-user access to the MVS command subsystem.  This  d
°          ment describes the installation of TSSO, TSSO parameters, and
°          use of the three components.

°          Because TSSO has grown in function  and  complexity,  a  plan
°          section  is  now necessary to describe pre-requisite program
°          ducts, MVS I/O generation requirements, and security system
          ditioning.    This  section  should  be  reviewed  prior  to

°          TSSO 4.3 was developed for Bellcore internal use  as  part  o
°          study  on automating the operation of an MVS computer center.
°          cause the kernal of TSSO was  originally  developed  external
°          Bellcore, permission was granted to make this new version of
°          available as public domain, unsupported software. As a public
°          main  software  package,  TSSO  receives  no  formal support
°          Bellcore or anyone else.  Therefore, installations that  want
°          use  TSSO  must be prepared to support it locally as a worst
°          possibility. Questions, comments or enhancement requests are
°          ways welcome on an informal, non-committal basis.

°          An optional feature of TSSO 4.3 is the ability to secure your
°          consoles.  Console security requires MVS  operators  to  iden
°          themselves  before  issuing commands; thus, MVS installations
°          ways know which operators issue  which  commands.  The  follo
°          steps  should be taken prior to initializing TSSO with a secu
°          level other than "minimal".

°          1.  Provide a RACF user ID for each operator who will be  iss
°              MVS commands on the system. This includes the master cons
°              I/O console(s) and user consoles.

°          2.  Add  a  corresponding user ID to the User Attributes Data
°              (UADS), and set the USERDATA bits to X'C0' for operators
°              will  be  invoking the privileged TSSO commands (e.g., RE
°              OSCMD etc.).  Note that the USERDATA bits  also  control
°              thority  for  regular  TSO users, and, if the Program Con
°              Facility (PCF) is installed, the  OSCMD  and  REPLY  comm
°              must  be  modified  so that PCF and TSSO don't conflict.

°              the OSCMDATH user exit.

°          3.  Pick a security level. SECLEVEL=MEDIAL is a good initial
°              lection,  as operators can get used to the concept of log

°          lowing  TSO  commands  and CLISTS to be executed from an MVS
°          sole, with the response going back to the invoking console.

°          A number of TSO commands that are designed to run with  the
°          subsystem  are distributed with the base code.  TSO commands
°          primarily from CLISTs include the "OS family" and the REPLY
°          mand.  These are designed to provide services such as communi
°          ing  with  the  MVS  operator  and  issuing  messages  to the
°          console, communicating with the MVS command subsystem, and co
°          nicating with programs that have issued WTORs.   Applications
°          these  commands  are described below.  Figure 1 on page 20 su
°          rizes the behavior of OSCMD with the CMDRESP variable in  dif

°          These  include  the  CACHE  command  for  controlling 3880-21
°          3880-23 cache devices, the LINKLIST command  for  displaying
°          system  LNKLST  concatenation, and the VOLSER and VALLOC comm
°          for displaying UCB information for DASD devices.  Also, the C
°          command allows an MVS console operator running in a  virtual
°          chine under VM/SP, VM/SP HPO or the VM/XA systems facility to
°          sue CP commands and get the response back to the console invo

°          1.  CLISTs  can  be used to write operator HELP procedures to
°              MVS console.  This is demonstrated in Figure 3 on page 26

°          2.  The REPLY command is useful in CLISTS to automate operati
°              procedures with products that  communicate  to  the  oper
°              through  the  WTOR interface (e.g., NCCF and IMS).  For e
°              ple, if numerous NCCF commands are to be executed, these
°              be executed in a TSSO CLIST using the REPLY command with
°              sage  ID DSI802A. See the description of the REPLY comman
°              "Appendix A. TSSO Command Reference" on page 38.

°          3.  Comments may be placed at the end of MVS commands because
°              treats them as MVS command comments.   However,  JES2  tr
°              CLIST  comments  as data and tries to use them in forming
°              command.  Therefore, do not place CLIST comments on JES2
°              mands; place them on the lines following the  command.
°              example,  the  following  CLIST  is  invalid because it w
°              produce an invalid JES2 command.

°              This situation is remedied in MVS/SP JES2 Release  1.3.6
°              MVS/XA JES2 Release 2.1.5.

°          4.  Symbolic  substitution can be used in TSSO CLISTS as show
°              Figure 4 on page 26.

°          5.  Since operations personnel will be using OPF, the recomme
°              tion is to allow them to write their own CLISTS.

°          6.  TSSO CLISTS are invoked in the same fashion as TSSO comma
°              The normal TSO search sequence is followed.  The  recomme
°              tion  is to allocate a SYS1.TSSOPROC data set and allocat
°              to DDNAME SYSPROC in the TSSO bringup deck. The SYSPROC
°              set  may  also be dynamically allocated through the TSO A
°              CATE command. Lastly, the TSO EXEC command may be used to
°              ecute TSSO CLISTS.

°          7.  Use OSWTOH and WRITE *HI with caution. Do not highlight
°              sages unless their importance warrants it, because your o
°              ations  staff  will learn to ignore highlighted messages,
°              this can be harmful to your overall system operations.

°          A high percentage of MVS commands are issued in response to
°          tem  or subsystem messages, and these responses are predeterm
°          by the contents of the messages.  The TSSO  Automated  Operat
°          Facility  (AOF) frees the MVS console operator from routine t
°          by automating responses to system messages.    AOF  is  a  ta
°          driven  monitor  that  intercepts messages and carries out on
°          four actions:  suppresses, highlights, or lowlights the  mess
°          or  issues  an  MVS, JES2 or subsystem command.  Because AOF
°          not require the services of the TSSO address space, any numbe
°          messages can be processed simultaneously.

°          There are three steps required to install this facility; brie

°          1.  Create the AOF table.

°          2.  Assemble and link-edit the table into load module format.

°          3.  Store the module in SYS1.TSSOLOAD.

°          These steps are described in detail below.

°          Note that the table can be updated at any time.   Also,  you
°          create  multiple  tables,  although  only  one can be active
°          time.  Multiple tables may be useful so that  different  sets
°          commands  can be used at different times (e.g., first, second
°          third shifts).  You can change the active table in three ways

°          1.  By changing the TABLE= parameter in the parameter  deck;
°              new table will be available the next time TSSO is brought

°          2.  By  dynamically  reloading the table with the "#.RELOAD"
°              mand; the new table will be available immediately.

°          3.  By resetting the MATCHLIM parameter of any entry in  the
°              tive  AOF  table  with  the  ALTAOF command; the new MATC
°              value will be effective immediately.

°          Release 4.3 provides a sample  CLIST  for  assembling  and  l
°          editing the TSSO AOF table.  The CLIST makes the job of placi
°          new  AOF  table in production less cumbersome.  You will prob
°          need to modify ASMTAB for your installation.  Its syntax is

°                   __________

°          The CLIST can assemble a moderately sized  table,  link-edit
°          result,  and copy the resulting load module into SYS1.TSSOLOA
°          about  10  seconds.    The  RELOAD  parameter  will   issue
°          TSSO #.RELOAD command upon successful assembly and link-edit.

°          Alternately,  you can submit a batch job similar to the sampl
°          the TSSO.VERS43.ASM data set, member ASMTABLE.  You may tailo
°          copy of this data set to your specifications as follows:

°          1.  Include the appropriate installation-dependent informatio
°              the JOB card.

°          2.  Change the SYSIN DD card to point to your AOF table.

°          3.  Change  the load library name in the LKED.SYSLMOD step to

°          The  Network Communication Control Facility (NCCF) is an IBM
°          gram  product  that  provides  network  control  in  ACF/VTAM
°          ACF/TCAM  environments.  Through the addition of an OSCMD com
°          processor, NCCF allows a network operator to issue MVS, JES2,
°          subsystem  commands  and to retrieve responses at the NCCF te
°          nal.  The NCCF version of OSCMD is a completely  separate  en
°          from  the  TSO  version.   The command installs directly into
°          NCCF load library, or a concatenated data set, and is defined
°          NCCF in the DSICMD member of the NCCF parameter data set.

°          ø   The  NCCF  and  TSO  versions of OSCMD share the same poo
°              subsystem consoles.  When defining the NUMCONS parameter
°              "NUMCONS Parameter" on page 11) it is important  to  cons
°              the number of simultaneous NCCF users that will be using
°              facilities.

          ø   Although OSCMD runs with APF authority, NCCF does not req

°              APF  authorization  with this facility.   TSSO grants APF
°              thorization to the NCCF version of OSCMD  through  MVS  c
°              memory  services.  The operator command #.Q XMEM monitors
°              cross memory service environment.  A debug option display
°              message  when  the  NCCF version of OSCMD has called the
°              cross memory services routine.

°          ø   TSSO assumes that all NCCF users are authorized to issue
°              master  console commands.  The NCFOSATH user exit is prov
°              for coding a routine to alter  the  default.    The  exit
°              passed the NCCF user identifier.

°          ø   The  TSSO/NCCF  OSCMD  facility fully supports the NCCF R
°              command.  This allows remote operators to route MVS, JES2
°              subsystem commands to remote systems and to retrieve the
°              sponses.   This facility makes it possible for an operato
°              control (or at least monitor) many MVS hosts  from  one
°              console.

°          TSSO  operates  as a proper subsystem under MVS. Because of t
