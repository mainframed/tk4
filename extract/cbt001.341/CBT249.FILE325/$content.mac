IEFUTL   - Wells Fargo's version of the SMF User Time Limit exit.
 (10/84)   You will NOT be able to use this code as it stands because of
           some installation dependencies that are not shipped.
             This is an example of how to DISCONNECT A TSO USER rather
           than cancel when wait time is exceeded. The user then has
           however much time you allow in your RECONLIM= parameter to
           LOGON RECONNECT before VTAM automatically cancels the address
           space. The terminal becomes immediately available for use by
           other ids, and the disconnected id remains swapped out.
             See the code that refers to VTAM command: V NET,TERM, ...
           NOTE ===> This performs the same function through operator
           command that any user can invoke through keyboard action. If
           you are not familiar with CONDITIONAL LOGOFF, read "Invoking
           Unformatted System Service Type(COND) To Force a Reconnect
           Environment" in the TSO Terminal User's Guide.

JESLOGON - A program to allow a TSO user to logon to any SECONDARY
 (03/84)   subsystem. It acts as a one-time front end for the standard
           TMP, and is intended to be executed by the logon procedure.
           Jobs submissions and PSO (process sysout) requests are also
           handled by the secondary JES.

JESMAXCC - A pair of JES2 (SP1.3.3) exits that add text to the $HASP165
 (07/84)   message generated by NOTIFY= on the job card or by the JES2
           /*NOTIFY control card. If the job does not abend, the maximum
           condition code of all executed steps is added. If the job
           abends, the system or user abend code is added:
             $HASP165 yourjob ENDED AT node - MAX COND CODE 0000
             $HASP165 yourjob ENDED AT node - ABENDED USER xxx
             $HASP165 yourjob ENDED AT node - CANCELLED SYSTEM 222

OPCON    - OPerator CONsole monitor      MODIFIED FOR WFB 12/83
 (12/83)                                 TAKEN FROM CBT FILE338
                   S   P   Y             (NAME CHANGED TO "OPCON" IN
                                         THE CODE, BUT COMMENTS STILL
         ** CHANGES - V3.2 - CHANGES **  REFER TO "SPY")

           - ELIMINATE special character required to precede OS cmd
           - ELIMINATE secret auth SVC, restore MODESET and SVC34
           - CORRECT buffer address problem with line 1 of display
           - CORRECT loop count for UCM build routine
           - ADD subcommand A.. (AUTO W.. AFTER command entry)
           - ADD check at initialization for TSO OPER authority
           - MAKE command entry area non-display until passwd given
           - MAKE "oper redisplay" area modifiable for reentry
           - FILL both entry areas with nulls to allow char insert
           - REDISPLAY last cmd entered by user (instead of oper)
           - MOVE console status table to separate CSECT
           - RESTRUCTURE the help screen and use upper/lower case
           - PROVIDE TSO HELP entry as comments at end of source

           This program displays the contents of all active GRAPHIC
           operator's consoles on a TSO CRT. The operator's screen can
           be either a 327X or a 370-168 integrated console. The TSO
           user can use any 327X terminal.

ROOM     - (This version generalizes some offsets that were hard coded).
 (07/84)   A TSO command to allow a user to change the "room number"
           field in the JES JCT for the TSO session. This command is
           necessary because the room number field is not supported by
           UADS (and the field is overlayed by Wells Fargo accounting
           information during logon). ROOM makes it easy for the user
           to specify delivery information (printed on JES header and
           trailer pages) for all SYSOUT created during the session,
           including spun datasets.

           This code can serve as a model for allowing a TSO user to
           change through authorized means any otherwise protected
           information in the JES JCT or similar control blocks.

VTAMCHK  - This program is intended to be started automatically after
 (03/84)   an IPL (by COMMNDxx). It is used to start VTAM applications
           or issue other commands in an orderly sequence after VTAM
           is up and running.

           VTAMCHK has the option to delay between issuing each command
           because some environments themselves have time dependencies,
           such as $SLOGON1   (wait for initialization)
                   $SN,A=xx
           The source has a sample of the procedure and some commands.

VTOCLIST - A corrected version of the GTE VTOCLIST program taken from
 (07/84)   the CBT tape. Corrections include:
           - Provide support for DF/EF VSAM files which are allowed to
             have more than 16 extents
           - Two corrections to print extent numbers greater than 99.
           - A correction to print the "last ref data" and "use count".
