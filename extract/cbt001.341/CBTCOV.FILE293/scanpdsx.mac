   THERE ARE SEVERAL RULES THAT MUST BE FOLLOWED.

      ORDER.

   2) THE I/O METHOD IS THE READ FILE METHOD SO THE SUBSET
      FILE MUST BE FIXED 80-CHARACTER RECORDS.

   3) EACH MEMBER MUST BE THE FIRST 8 CHARACTERS OF A RECORD.

  NOTES:
   1)  WHEN ASKED FOR SUBSET FILE YOU MUST ENTER THE
      FILENAME AND FILETYPE OF THE FILE CONTAINING THIS
      INFORMATION, OR, YOU CAN ENTER THE WORD TERM  WHICH
      WILL THEN ALLOW YOU TO ENTER THE MEMBERS TO BE SCANNED
      FROM THE TERMINAL. YOU WILL BE PROMPTED TO ENTER THEM BY
