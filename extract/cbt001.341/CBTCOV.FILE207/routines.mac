************************************************************************

ACTION - Contains main loop on calls to other routines as needed per
         starminute.
BEAM   - Controls transporting of troops to and fro.
BHOLE  - Determines effects of black hole gravitational fields on
         movements.
BLOCK  - Contains intial values for data.
BPAGE  - Moves next line output to top of page.
CHEKDG - Checks if requested E facility damaged or not.
COLLIS - Determines all possible collisions, handles supernova
         explosions, black hole captures.
COSD   - This computes the cosine of an angle where the argument is in
         degrees instead of radians.
DAMAGE - Determines extent of damage and crew + troop casualties when E
         is hit with shields down, or collision.
DLETE  - Deletes an object from the quadrant and from the galaxy if
         necessary.
DOCK   - ENTERPRISE docking with starbase routine.
EFPHSR - ENTERPRISE firing phasers routine.
EFTSUB - ENTERPRISE firing photon torpedos routine.
EPHIT  - Records E or G phaser hit on enemy vessel, extent of damage.
EPMOVE - ENTERPRISE movement routine.  Also handles exceeding gaoactic
         limits.
EPULSE - ENTERPRISE pulsive beams routine.
FIGHT  - Controls combat on board enemy vessels, computing casualties
         for each side.
GETBRG - Returns a bearing in the 0 - 360 range from one object to
         another.
GHACTV - Ghostship activites routine.
HELP   - Prints explanarory messages from disk file when requested by
         player.
HITONE - Records a hit on the enterprise.
KLNGN  - Klingon activities routine.
KLQ    - Checks for Klingons leaving quadrant or galaxy.
MASKEF - Computes phaser attenuation due to masking effects.
OMOVE  - Movement routine for Klingons and ghostships.
PLIN   - Sets up galactic matrix at beginning of game.
PROCM  - Processes commands input by user in subroutine TRY1.  Either
         executes them immediately (in the case of 2,3,8,9,12,13,14,15,
         16,17,18,22 commands) or queues them for execution by the
         appropriate routine.
PUTIN  - Sets up display for each quadrant and also makes sure no 2
         objects start on same point.
QDATE  - Returns the current date for check of playing rated games.
QQMOVE - Controls movement of K & R between quadrants where fighting
         is not going on.
QTIME  - Returns the time of day in seconds since midnight as an integer
         value. (0 - 86399)
RAN    - System function that generated a random number uniformly
         distributed on the interval 0 -1.
RAND   - Routine to specify a seed for the random number generator.
RANGE  - Function to return distance in parsecs between 2 objects.
RATING - End of game routine.  Updates rating file, performs other
         housekeeping to end run.
REPAIR - Damage repair routine for all vessels.  Also disease losses
         and energy losses due to alien life forms calculated here.
ROMLN  - Romulan activities routine.
RSTART - Saves and Restarts rated game.
SCAN   - Generates short range sensor scans.
SIND   - This computes the sine of an angle where the argument is in
         degrees instead of radians.
STAR79 - Beginning of game setup.  Input user game requests.
STORM  - Routine to handle objects captured by nucleonic storm.
TRPMV  - Torpedo movement routine.
TRY1   - Command input routine.  Checks for legal input.
TSHUTL - Shuttlecraft activities routine.
