    NAME IEWFETCH
 * LOCAL MOD TO FETCH TO INCREASE THE MAXIMUM SIZE AREA WHICH IS
 *  FIXED FOR PROGRAM TEXT DATA PER I/O SEQUENCE.
 *  THIS SHOULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASING THE AMOUNT
 *  OF TEXT BLOCK CHAINED READS.
 *  WITH ITS CURRENT FIX LIMIT OF 18K, IF TEXT IS BLOCKED 12K WHICH IS
 *  THE MAXIMUM FOR 3330, ONLY ONE BLOCK CAN BE PROCESSED PER SIO.
 *  BY INCREASING THE FIX LIMIT TO 64K, POTENTIALLY 5 BLOCKS COULD BE
 *  PROCESSED ASSUMING RELOCATION CAN BE FULLY PERFORMED DURING PCI TIME
 *  THIS CHANGE SHOULD ALSO DECREASE (BY A FACTOR OF UP TO 5) THE NUMBER
 *  OF CHANNEL END/DEVICE END INTERRUPTS, RELATED IOS AND POST STATUS
 *  INTERRUP HANDLING TIME,AND DISPATCHER/SRB SCHEDULING/PROCESSING TIME
