)F Function -
  The PEXEC command initiates execution of a command procedure
  stored in a PANVALET library.

)X Syntax -
        PEXEC   'member' ''parameter list'' LIST/NOLIST PROMPT/NOPROMPT
        EXPAND/NOEXPAND  WARN/NOWARN  DDNAME('ddname')
        ACCESS('security-code')

  Required - member
  Defaults - NOLIST,NOPROMPT,NOEXPAND,WARN,DDNAME(PANDD1)
  Alias    - PEX
  Note     - The parameter list must be enclosed in apostrophies when
             it is included on the invocation statement.
             Members of the parameter list must be separated by the
             standard TSO delimiters.

)O Operands -
  'member' - The name of the PANVALET library member which contains the
             procedure to be executed.

  ''parameter list''
           - The list of values which are to be substituted for the
             symbolic parameters defined when the command procedure was
             created.  This list (excluding delimiting quotes) may not
             contain more that 180 characters.
))LIST     - The commands and subcommands in the command procedure are
             to be listed at the terminal as they are executed.
))NOLIST   - The commands and subcommands in the command procedure are
             not to be listed at the terminal.
))PROMPT   - Prompting to the terminal for input is to be allowed
             during the execution of the command procedure.  All
             commands and subcommands in the command procedure will
             be listed at the terminal as they are executed, unless
             the nolist option is explicitly specified.
))NOPROMPT - Prompting to the terminal for input is not to be allowed
             during the execution of the command procedure.
))EXPAND   - Specifies that the member contains ++INCLUDE statements
             which specify PANVALET library members to be included as
             part of the command procedure to be executed.
))NOEXPAND - Specifies that the member may or may not contain ++INCLUDE
             statements but they are to be ignored.
))WARN     - Specifies that the user will be warned if attempts are
             made to access a library member that has been tagged
             DISABLED or INACTIVE.  Warning messages are not issued for
             members that are ++INCLUDED which have been marked
             INACTIVE or DISABLED.
))NOWARN   - The user will receive no warning messages with regards to
             the status of the member.
))DDNAME   - An alternate ddname of an allocated PANVALET library.  If
             EXPAND is specified, all ++INCLUDED members must reside in
             the library allocated to the specified ddname.
))ACCESS   - Allows user to specify a PANVALET security code if the
             member is PANVALET security code protected.
