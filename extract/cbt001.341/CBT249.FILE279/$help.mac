)F Function -
  The $ command initiates execution of a command procedure
  stored in a PANVALET library.

  Note:
   The $ command is an abbreviated form of the PEXEC command.  The
   command defaults certain parameters of the PEXEC command.  These
   defaults can not be overridden unless the PEXEC command is called.

   Also note that if $ fails to locate the specified CLIST in the
   PANVALET library, it will attempt to locate it in the CLIST
   libraries allocated to SYSPROC (if any).  If the command is
   greater that eight characters in length or starts with an number
   the command will fail with the error:

   $ COMMAND ERROR - NAME NOT FOUND IN PANVALET LIBRARY.

   if it is not found, it will fail with the error:

   SUBCOMMAND NOT FOUND.
)X Syntax -
        $   'member' 'parameter list'

  Required - member
  Defaults - NOLIST,NOPROMPT,NOEXPAND,WARN,DDNAME(PANDD1)

)O Operands -
  'member' - The name of the PANVALET library member which contains the
             procedure to be executed.
  'parameter list'
           - The list of values which are to be substituted for the
             symbolic parameters defined when the command procedure was
             created.  This list may not contain more than 180
             characters.  Unlike PEXEC, the parameters do not need to
             enclosed in quotes.
))NOLIST   - The commands and subcommands in the command procedure are
             not to be listed at the terminal.
))NOPROMPT - Prompting to the terminal for input is not to be allowed
             during the execution of the command procedure.
))NOEXPAND - Specifies that the member may or may not contain ++INCLUDE
             statements but they are to be ignored.
))WARN     - Specifies that the user will be warned if attempts are
             made to access a library member that has been tagged
             DISABLED or INACTIVE. Warning messages are not issued for
             members that are ++INCLUDED which have been marked
             INACTIVE or DISABLED.
))DDNAME   - An alternate ddname of an allocated PANVALET library.  If
             EXPAND is specified, all ++INCLUDED members must reside in
             the library allocated to the specified ddname.
