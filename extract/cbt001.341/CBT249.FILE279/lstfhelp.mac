  NOTES    - TERMFILE, NULLFILE, DATAFILE, SHR, NEW, OLD, MOD, CAT, and
             UNK are used to limit the ddnames displayed. Omission of
             these options will generate a list of all ddnames
             allocated dynamically or dynamically and at logon time
             (if the LOGON option is included).

  The format of the output is -

          xy sss ooo dddddddd nnn....

(Sample)  S* SHR PS  SYS00016 DPS296.TEST.DATA

  where - x is P if the ddname was allocated at logon time
          (i.e. it was in the logon proc) or S if the ddname was
          allocated by the session,

          y is * if the dataset has been marked not inuse else a space,

          sss is the status of the dataset (NEW, OLD, SHR, MOD, CAT,
          or UNK),

          ooo is the organization (i.e. PO, PS, DA),

          dddddddd is the ddname,

          nnn... is the dataset name (and optionally member name).

)O Operands -
))ALL      - All ddnames are displayed unconditionally.  This overrides
             all other options. 'LISTFILE ALL' is equivilent to
             specifying 'LISTFILE LOGON SYS'.
))LOGON    - Ddnames allocated at logon time are to be included in the
             list.  Without this option, only ddnames dynamically
             allocated during the session will be displayed.
))TERMFILE - Only ddnames allocated to the session terminal are to
             be displayed.
))NULLFILE - Only ddnames allocated to the dummy dataset (or attributes)
             are to be displayed.
))DATAFILE - Only ddnames allocated to mass stoarge devices are to
             be displayed.
))SHR      - Only ddnames with a status of shr are to be listed.
))NEW      - Only ddnames with a status of new are to be listed.
))MOD      - Only ddnames with a status of mod are to be listed.
))OLD      - Only ddnames with a status of old are to be listed.
))UNK      - Only ddnames with an undetermined status are to be listed.
))CAT      - Only ddnames that are being used for private catalogs are
             to be listed.
))SYS      - System assigned names are displayed.

))Examples -
 List the ddnames allocated by the session (except
 system generated dsnames).....................LISTFILE

 List all of the ddnames allocated to the
 session.......................................LISTFILE ALL

 List all of the ddnames allocated to the terminal
 at logon time or by the session...............LISTFILE LOGON TERMFILE

 List all of the ddnames allocated by the seesion
 only that have a status of old................LISTFILE OLD
