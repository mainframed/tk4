//***FILE 291 is from Wilbur C. Hadden of the Department of Health  *
//*           and Human Services in Washington, D.C. and contains   *
//*           an interface to allow a PL/1 program to control a     *
//*           3270 type terminal from a TSO environment.            *
//*                                                                 *
//*              Formatted Displays on 3270 Terminals               *
//*                                                                 *
//*      With 3270 terminals it is possible to format displays      *
//*      so that certain portions of the screen are used for the    *
//*      operator's response and other portions are reserved for    *
//*      use by the program controlling the display.                *
//*                                                                 *
//*      The advantage of using formatted communications over       *
//*      unformatted is that a formatted display may present the    *
//*      operator with more than one request for information at     *
//*      one time.  This lengthens messages between computer and    *
//*      operator; each message contains more information and       *
//*      the rhythm of the communication is more natural.  By       *
//*      grouping related items together in a formatted display     *
//*      each request for information is embedded in a broader      *
//*      context.  From this broader context the operator is able   *
//*      to find a better understanding of the meaning or           *
//*      purpose of information requests and can thus respond       *
//*      with better answers.  The fact that the operator's         *
//*      responses are not transmitted until all requests are       *
//*      satisfied means that the operator has more opportunity     *
//*      to review and revise responses before they are entered.    *
//*      These characteristics of formatted communications mean     *
//*      that the operator has more control over responses and      *
//*      can respond with greater accuracy.                         *
//*                                                                 *
