   The O subcommand selection panel directs you as to which PDS are
   available.  Enter a one to five character subcommand abbreviation
   to continue with the subcommand assistance panel.

   Shorthand notes:
    1.  You can bypass the O command option panel.  For example, enter
        O.V as a command to enter the VERIFY assistance panel.  Note:
        the following example would skip both panels:  O.V.memname stats
    2.  From the O command option panel, you can bypass the
        assistance panel.  For example, enter: v.memname stats
        to format the subcommand:  Verify memname stats

   To get explanations of PDS subcommands, you need to reference the PDS
   HELP data set.  Enter H from the%OPTION ===>+line on the O subcommand
   selection panel to use the HELP subcommand assistance panel.
