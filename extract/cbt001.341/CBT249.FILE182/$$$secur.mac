                              PDS COMMAND -- SECURITY EXITS

 VSUBCMD -- an optional subcommand authorization exit

       1.  If a subcommand exit is linked with PDS it will gain control
           after PARSE and just before each subcommand is executed.
           a.  PDS subcommands of the form  IF ... THEN(xxx) ELSE(yyy)
               will cause VSUBCMD to gain control up to three times:
               1.  The first exit will be for subcommand IF
               2.  The second exit will be for subcommand XXX (if any)
               3.  The third exit will be for subcommand YYY (if any)
           b.  PDS subcommands of the form  FIND ... THEN(xxx) ELSE(yyy)
               will also cause VSUBCMD to gain control up to three times
               1.  The first exit will be for subcommand FIND
               2.  The second exit will be for subcommand XXX (if any)
               3.  The third exit will be for subcommand YYY (if any)
           c.  This exit will not gain control for an implied CLIST call
               (such as %PDSCLIST) or for the RECALL subcommand.

       2.  The argument list passed to VSUBCMD is as follows:

           DISPLACEMENT    NAME         DESCRIPTION
           ------------    ----         -----------
                      0    FULLTEXT     POINTS TO AL2(LENGTH),AL2(OFFSET
                                                  C'ORIGINAL SUBCOMMAND'
                      4    UPT          UPT DSECT
                      8    PSCB         PSCB DSECT
                     12    ECT          ECT DSECT
                     16    SUBCOMMAND   THE 8 CHARACTER SUBCOMMAND NAME
                     20    DSNAME       THE 44 CHARACTER DATA SET NAME


       3.  The first argument is the text of the subcommand as it
           appeared before PARSE was invoked by PDS.

       4.  The first four parameters form a TSO CPPL; thus, most TSO
           command processor functions may be performed in this exit.
           However, the exit should be reentrant or the PDS command will
           lose its reentrant attribute.

       5.  The fifth parameter is the eight character subcommand name
           except in the following situations:
           a.  "ATTRIB" will be converted to "ATTRMOD" if any module
               attribute changes are requested.
           b.  "VERIFY" will be converted to "VERMOD" unless the
               NOUPDATE operand is also entered.

       6.  The following PDS subcommand names modify the target data set
           ALIAS, ATTRMOD (as converted above), COMPRESS, DELETE,
           EDIT, FIXPDS, FSE, RENAME, REPLACE, RESTORE, TSOEDIT and VERM
           (as converted above).

       7.  The exit must set a return code to direct processing action
           for each subcommand:
           a.  RC=0   allow the subcommand; it is authorized
           b.  RC=4   do not allow the subcommand; it is not authorized
               (the subcommand is to be terminated with a PDS920E messag

       8.  For additional details, refer to the sample VSUBCMD exit and
           sample installation JCL in member VSUBCMD.




 VTSOCMD -- a optional TSO command authorization exit

       1.  If a TSO command exit is linked with PDS it will gain control
           before the TSO subcommand attaches each TSO command.

       2.  The argument list passed to VTSOCMD is as follows:

           DISPLACEMENT    NAME          DESCRIPTION
           ------------    ----          -----------
                      0    FULLTEXT      POINTS TO AL2(LENGTH),AL2(OFFSE
                                                   C'ORIGINAL SUBCOMMAND
                      4    UPT           UPT DSECT
                      8    PSCB          PSCB DSECT
                     12    ECT           ECT DSECT
                     16    TSO COMMAND   THE 8 CHARACTER TSO COMMAND


       3.  The first argument is the text of the subcommand as it
           appeared before PARSE was invoked by PDS.

       4.  The first four parameters form a TSO CPPL; thus, most TSO
           command processor functions may be performed in this exit.
           However, the exit should be reentrant or the PDS command will
           lose its reentrant attribute.

       5.  The fifth parameter is the eight character TSO command name.

       6.  The exit must set a return code to direct processing action
           for each command:
           a.  RC=0   allow the TSO command; it is authorized
           b.  RC=4   do not allow the TSO command; it is not authorized
               (the TSO command is to be terminated with a PDS910E messa

       7.  For additional details, refer to the sample VTSOCMD exit and
           sample installation JCL in member VTSOCMD.
