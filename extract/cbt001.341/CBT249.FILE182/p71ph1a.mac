    %1+Suspend ISPMODE      - terminates ISPMODE and remembers the sessi
                              until PDS is terminated
    %2+Clear log            - clears the ISPMODE log
    %3+Clear below          - clears ISPMODE log lines below the top lin
    %4+Clear above          - clears ISPMODE log lines above the top lin
    %6+MEMLIST              - initializes MEMLIST mode for all data set
    %7+Output ISPMODE table - produces a copy of the current ISPMODE tab
    %O+Options command      - assists with PDS subcommands

   In addition to the special control codes, PDS subcommands and ISPF
   commands (HELP, SPLIT, END, RETURN, UP, DOWN, SPLIT, CURSOR, PRINT,
   KEYS, TSO or PANELID) may be entered on the command line.

  %Note:+if you wish to use a PDS subcommand name which matches the name
   of an ISPF subcommand, use a substring of the name (for example, use
   H, HE or HEL instead of HELP).
