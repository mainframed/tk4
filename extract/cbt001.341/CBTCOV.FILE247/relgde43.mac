          INTRODUCTION

          THE TIME SHARING SUBSYSTEM OPTION (TSSO) IS A PACKAGE DESIGNED
          INCREASE  OPERATIONS  AND END USER PRODUCTIVITY BY PROVIDING T
          LIKE SERVICES TO THE MVS OPERATOR, AND MVS  CONSOLE  SERVICES
          THE TSO AND NCCF USER. TSSO CAN GREATLY ENHANCE AN INSTALLATIO
          EFFORTS TO EFFICIENTLY CONTROL AND OPERATE MVS BY AUTOMATING M
          OPERATIONAL  PROCEDURES.   THIS DOCUMENT DESCRIBES THE CHANGES
          TSSO IN VERSION 4, RELEASE  3.  KNOWLEDGE  OF  TSSO  CONCEPTS
          ASSUMED.1

          VERSION  4.3  OF  THE  TIME  SHARING  SUBSYSTEM  OPTION  PROVI
          ENHANCEMENTS  OVER  THE PREVIOUS RELEASE IN FIVE MAIN AREAS. T
          ARE:

            1.  ENHANCEMENTS  TO  THE  OPERATIONS   PRODUCTIVITY   FACIL
                (TSSO/OPF). THESE ENHANCEMENTS ARE SPECIFICALLY IN THE A
                OF INCREASED AUTOMATION CAPABILITY THROUGH  EXPANDED  CL
                ORIENTED  TSSO COMMANDS, AND THE REMOVAL OF THE RESTRICT
                OF ONLY ONE OUTSTANDING OSCMD IN THE SYSTEM.

            2.  ENHANCEMENTS   TO   THE   AUTOMATED   OPERATIONS   FACIL
                (TSSO/AOF). THESE ENHANCEMENTS PROVIDE EASE OF USE FEATU
                FOR SYSTEM  PROGRAMMERS  AND  OPERATORS  DEALING  WITH
                TSSO/AOF COMPONENT.

            3.  THE ADDITION OF AN INTERFACE TO THE NETWORK  COMMUNICATI
                CONTROL  FACILITY (NCCF). THIS INTERFACE ALLOWS THE NETW
                OPERATOR TO ISSUE MVS, JES2 OR  OTHER  SUBSYSTEM  COMMAN
                AND RETRIEVE THE RESPONSE AT THE NCCF TERMINAL.

            4.  THE TSSO CONSOLE SECURITY FEATURE HAS BEEN UPGRADED TO
                THE  SYSTEM  ACCESS  FACILITY FOR ITS INTERFACE TO SECUR
                SYSTEMS.

            5.  NUMEROUS RAS (RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY AND SERVICEABILI
                ENHANCEMENTS, TO PROVIDE GREATER TSSO STABILITY.

          EACH OF THESE ENHANCEMENTS WILL NOW BE DISCUSSED SEPARATELY.

          ENHANCEMENTS TO THE OPERATOR PRODUCTIVITY FACILITY

          THE FOLLOWING ENHANCEMENTS WERE MADE TO THE OPERATOR PRODUCTIV
          FACILITY:

            1.  TSSO NOW ALLOWS MORE THAN ONE SIMULTANEOUS  CALLER  OF
                OSCMD  TSO  COMMAND. THE INSTALLATION DEFINES THE NUMBER
                SIMULTANEOUS CALLERS IN THE NEW NUMCONS  PARAMETER  IN
                TSSO  INITIALIZATION  DECK.  INSTALLATIONS  MUST DEFINE
                SUBSYSTEM CONSOLE TO MVS FOR EVERY SIMULTANEOUS  CALLER
                OSCMD.  IN ADDITION, AN INSTALLATION MAY CHOOSE TO DEDIC
                ONE SUBSYSTEM CONSOLE FOR THE TSSO ADDRESS SPACE.  THIS
                ACCOMPLISHED  THROUGH  A  DEDICATE PARAMETER ON THE NUMC
                STATEMENT. TSSO 4.3 PROVIDES AN EXPANDED  OPERATOR  COMM
                (#.Q SCON) TO MONITOR THE STATUS OF THE SUBSYSTEM CONSOL
                THIS WILL ALLOW AN INSTALLATION TO DETERMINE WHO  IS  US
                THE SUBSYSTEM CONSOLES, AND HOW MANY ARE NEEDED.

            2.  THE OSCMD COMMAND HAS BEEN REWRITTEN FOR TSSO 4.3.  IT
                SUPPORTS  THE  CAPABILITY  TO  DIRECT  THE  RESPONSE  OF
                OPERATING SYSTEM, JES2 OR SUBSYSTEM COMMAND TO

                  1.  A TSO TERMINAL - IF  OSCMD  WAS  ISSUED  FROM  A
                      ADDRESS SPACE.

                  2.  THE MVS CONSOLE -  IF  OSCMD  WAS  PART  OF  A  CL
                      INITIATED FROM THE TSSO ADDRESS SPACE.

                  3.  CLIST VARIABLES - IF OSCMD WAS ISSUED FROM A CLIST

                THE REDIRECTION  OF  MVS  COMMAND  OUTPUT  IS  ACCOMPLIS
                THROUGH  A CLIST VARIABLE (CMDRESP), WHICH IS USED AS IN
                TO OSCMD.

                OSCMD NOW SUPPORTS A USER EXIT, TO ALLOW AN INSTALLATION
                CODE  A  ROUTINE  TO  DETERMINE THE MVS COMMAND GROUP LE
                (E.G. SYSTEM, I/O, MASTER OR INFO) THE TSO USER IS  ALLO
                TO  ISSUE.  THE  DEFAULT  VERSION OF THE OSCMDATH USER E
                ALLOWS THE TSO USER THE AUTHORITY  OF  AN  MVS  INFORMAT
                ONLY  CONSOLE,  UNLESS  THE X'C0' BITS ARE TURNED ON IN
                USERDATA FIELD OF THE TSO USER'S UADS ENTRY.  THIS  MAY
                DONE   THROUGH   THE   USERDATA  PARAMETER  OF  THE  CHA
                SUBCOMMAND IN TSO ACCOUNT.













          MEMORANDUM FOR FILE - 3                        SEPTEMBER 16, 1




            3.  A NEW COMMAND, OSWAIT, IS INCLUDED IN TSSO 4.3.  OSWAIT
                INTENDED  TO  BE  ISSUED  FROM  THE  CLIST ENVIRONMENT,
                ALLOWS THE CLIST TO WAIT FOR A SPECIFIED MESSAGE TO  APP
                ON  THE MVS CONSOLE. THE MESSAGE IS DEFINED IN THE TSSO/
                TABLE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE FOLLOWING CLIST WILL START  A  J
                WAIT FOR THE JOB TO COMPLETE, AND PURGE THE JOB.

                     PROC 0
                     /***************************************/
                     /* THIS CLIST WILL START A JOB, WAIT   */
                     /* FOR ITS COMPLETION, AND PURGE THE   */
                     /* JOB.                                */
                     /***************************************/

                     OSCMD S MYJOB
                     OSWAIT ENTRY(MYJOBEND)   TIMEOUT(60)
                     OSWTO MYJOB HAS ENDED...
                     OSCMD $P'MYJOB'
                     EXIT

                NOTE THAT THE TIMEOUT PARAMETER ALLOWS THE CLIST  DEVELO
                TO  SPECIFY  HOW  MANY  SECONDS  TO WAIT FOR THE MESSAGE
                APPEAR.  THE  FOLLOWING  TSSO/AOF  TABLE  DEFINITION  EN
                SUPPORTS  THE ABOVE CLIST (NOTE THAT IEF404I IS THE MVS
                ENDED MESSAGE).

                   TABENTRY MSG=IEF404I,ACTION=POST,TEST=((W,2,5,'MYJOB'


                THE OSWAIT  COMMAND  PROVIDES  FOR  SIGNIFICANT  AUTOMAT
                OPPORTUNITIES  THAT WERE (IN PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF TSSO)
                CUMBERSOME TO JUSTIFY DEVELOPMENT.

                OSWAIT DOES NOT NEED TO RUN FROM THE TSSO ADDRESS SPACE.
                THEORY,   AN  INSTALLATION  MAY  HAVE  MANY  OSWAIT  EVE
                OUTSTANDING AT ANY ONE TIME,  IN  DIFFERENT  TSO  OR  BA
                ADDRESS  SPACES. FOR EXAMPLE, A SIMPLE JOB SCHEDULER CAN
                CODED AS A CLIST USING THE  OSWAIT  AND  OSCMD  FACILITI
                THIS  CLIST CAN THEN BE RUN UNDER CONTROL OF A BATCH TMP
                A SEPARATE ADDRESS SPACE.

                IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT ALTHOUGH TSSO  DOES  NOT  HAVE
                FACILITY  FOR  TIMER  DEPENDENT  COMMANDS,  IT  MAY UTIL
                EITHER THE JES2 AUTOMATIC COMMAND  FACILITY,  OR  THE  N
                "AT"  AND  "EVERY"  COMMANDS  TO  START  CLISTS AT SPECI
                TIMES, OR AT SPECIFIED INTERVALS.

          ENHANCEMENTS TO THE AUTOMATED OPERATIONS FACILITY

          THE FOLLOWING ENHANCEMENTS WERE MADE TO THE AUTOMATED  OPERATI
          FACILITY (AOF) COMPONENT OF TSSO.

            1.  TSSO 4.3 SUPPORTS A  LABEL  ON  THE  TABENTRY  MACRO.  T
                PARAMETER  ALLOWS THE CODER OF THE AOF TABLE TO ASSOCIAT
                1-8 CHARACTER IDENTIFIER WITH  EACH  TABENTRY  MACRO.  T
                IDENTIFIER  CAN  THE BE USED AS A PARAMETER TO THE DISPA
                ALTAOF OR OSWAIT COMMANDS.

            2.  THE DISPAOF COMMAND IS ENHANCED TO DISPLAY  THE  NEW  LA
                ASSOCIATED  WITH  THE TABENTRY MACRO.  IT CAN ALSO USE T
                LABEL AS AN OPERAND TO THE ENTRYID PARAMETER.  DISPAOF W
                DISPLAY  ALL  ENTRIES  THAT  START  WITH  THE  GIVEN  EN
                IDENTIFIER. IN ADDITION, THE MSG PARAMETER OF  THE  DISP
                COMMAND  IS ENHANCED TO DISPLAY ALL ENTRIES THAT START W
                THE GIVEN MESSAGE IDENTIFIER, INSTEAD OF THE REQUIREMENT
                AN EXACT MATCH. FOR EXAMPLE, THE COMMAND

                   DISPAOF ENTRY(VTAMUP)


                WILL DISPLAY ALL TSSO/AOF TABLE  ENTRIES  THAT  HAVE  EN
                IDENTIFIER STARTING WITH "VTAMUP". THE COMMAND


                   DISPAOF MSG($HASP)


                WILL DISPLAY ALL TSSO/AOF TABLE ENTRIES WITH A  MESSAGE
                STARTING WITH $HASP (E.G. ALL JES2 RELATED ENTRIES).

            3.  A NEW CLIST (ASMTAB) IS PROVIDED TO ASSEMBLE AND  LINK-E
                THE  TSSO AOF TABLE. THIS CLIST REDUCES THE CUMBERSOME T
                OF PLACING A NEW AOF TABLE INTO PRODUCTION. IT IS  INTEN
                AS  AN  EXAMPLE,  AND WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO BE MODIFIED
                USE  IN  YOUR  INSTALLATION.   THE  CLIST  CAN  ASSEMBLE
                MODERATELY  SIZED TABLE, LINK EDIT THE RESULT, AND COPY
                RESULTING  LOAD  MODULE  INTO  SYS1.TSSOLOAD  IN  ABOUT
                SECONDS.   THE  CLIST  HAS  A RELOAD PARAMETER TO ISSUE
                TSSO #.RELOAD COMMAND UPON SUCCESSFUL  ASSEMBLY  AND  LI
                EDIT.

            4.  TSSO/AOF SUPPORTS THE OSWAIT  COMMAND  BY  RECOGNIZING
                SPECIFICATION OF ACTION=POST ON THE TABENTRY MACRO.

          ADDITION OF AN INTERFACE TO NCCF

          THE NETWORK COMMUNICATION CONTROL  FACILITY  IS  AN  IBM  PROG
          PRODUCT THAT PROVIDES FOR NETWORK CONTROL IN ACF/VTAM OR ACF/T
          ENVIRONMENTS. THROUGH THE ADDITION OF AN OSCMD COMMAND PROCESS
          NCCF  NOW  SUPPORTS  CONTROL  OF  MVS,  JES2 OR OTHER SUBSYSTE
          SPECIFICALLY, THE NCCF VERSION OF OSCMD ALLOWS A NETWORK OPERA
          TO  ISSUE MVS, JES2 OR SUBSYSTEM COMMANDS, AND RETRIEVE RESPON
          AT THE NCCF TERMINAL.  THE NCCF VERSION OF OSCMD IS A  COMPLET
          SEPARATE ENTITY FROM THE TSO VERSION. THIS COMMAND PROCESSOR U
          STANDARD NCCF AND TSSO FACILITIES TO ALLOW AN  NCCF  OPERATOR
          ISSUE  OPERATING  SYSTEM  COMMANDS  AND  RETRIEVE  RESPONSES.
          COMMAND INSTALLS DIRECTLY  INTO  THE  NCCF  LOAD  LIBRARY,  OR
          CONCATENATED DATASET, AND IS DEFINED TO NCCF IN THE DSICMD MEM
          OF THE NCCF PARAMETER DATA SET.

          IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT FOLLOWING POINTS:

            A.  THE NCCF AND TSO VERSIONS OF OSCMD SHARE THE SAME  POOL
                SUBSYSTEM CONSOLES. WHEN DEFINING THE NUMCONS PARAMETER,
                IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER THE NUMBER  OF  SIMULTANEOUS  N
                USERS THAT WILL BE USING TSSO FACILITIES.

            B.  NCCF DOES NOT REQUIRE APF  AUTHORIZATION  BECAUSE  OF  T
                FACILITY.  THIS  IS DESPITE THE FACT THAT OSCMD DOES IND
                RUN WITH APF AUTHORIZATION. TSSO GRANTS  APF  AUTHORIZAT
                TO  THE  NCCF VERSION OF OSCMD THROUGH THE USE OF MVS CR
                MEMORY SERVICES. TSSO PROVIDES A NEW OPERATOR COMMAND  (
                XMEM) TO MONITOR THE CROSS MEMORY ENVIRONMENT, AS WELL A
                DEBUG OPTION TO DISPLAY WHEN THE NCCF VERSION OF OSCMD
                CALLED THE TSSO CROSS MEMORY SERVICES ROUTINE.

                THIS AUTHORIZATION METHOD IS  CONTRASTED  WITH  IBM'S  O
                PRODUCT,  WHICH  REQUIRES  ALL DATASETS IN THE NCCF STEP
                CONCATENATION TO BE IN THE APF AUTHORIZATION LIST.

            C.  TSSO ASSUMES THAT ALL NCCF USERS ARE  AUTHORIZED  TO  IS
                MVS  MASTER CONSOLE COMMANDS. A USER EXIT IS PROVIDED IF
                INSTALLATION WISHES TO ALTER  THIS  DEFAULT.  THE  EXIT
                PASSED THE NCCF USER IDENTIFIER.

            D.  THE TSSO/NCCF OSCMD FACILITY FULLY SUPPORTS THE USE OF
                NCCF  ROUTE  COMMAND.  THIS ALLOWS REMOTE OPERATOR TO RO
                MVS, JES2 OR SUBSYSTEM  COMMANDS  TO  REMOTE  SYSTEMS,
                RETRIEVE THE RESPONSES. THIS FACILITY MAKES IT POSSIBLE
                AN OPERATOR TO CONTROL (OR AT LEAST MONITOR) MANY MVS HO
                FROM ONE NCCF CONSOLE.

          TSSO CONSOLE SECURITY SAF INTERFACE

          THE TSSO CONSOLE SECURITY COMPONENT IS ENHANCED TO USE THE SYS
          ACCESS  FACILITY  (SAF)  INTERFACE. ALL CALLS MADE BY TSSO TO
          RACF SECURITY SYSTEM WERE  REPLACED  BY  SAF  CALLS.  RACF  US
          SHOULD  NOTICE  NO  DIFFERENCES  BECAUSE OF THIS ENHANCEMENT.
          SECRET USERS SHOULD ALSO BE UNAFFECTED.  THE  ENHANCEMENT  ALL
          FOR  ACF2  SUPPORT  TO BE PROVIDED USING STANDARD MVS FACILITI
          ACF2 USERS WILL  NEED  ACF2  VERSION  4.1  TO  SUPPORT  THIS
          FEATURE.  NOTE  THAT ACF2 SUPPORT IS CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOPME
          AND IS NOT AVAILABLE IN THE BASE TSSO 4.3 CODE.

          RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY AND SERVICEABILITY

          THE FOLLOWING ENHANCEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO TSSO TO ENHANCE I
          RELIABILITY, AVAILABILITY AND SERVICEABILITY (RAS).

            1.  TSSO NO LONGER ALLOWS THE OPERATOR TO START TSSO IF  IT
                ALREADY  UP. PREVIOUS RELEASES OF TSSO WOULD ALLOW NUMER
                "INCARNATIONS" OF TSSO  ADDRESS  SPACES  TO  EXIST  IN
                SYSTEM.

            2.  SINCE IT MAY OCCASIONALLY BECOME NECESSARY TO  FORCE  ST
                TSSO  (E.G.   DEFEAT THE ABOVE FEATURE), A NEW PARAMETER
                AVAILABLE IN THE PARM FIELD OF THE START  COMMAND  USED
                START  TSSO.  IF  THE  PARAMETER BEGINS WITH A SLASH ('/
                TSSO WILL RESTART OVER ITSELF.

            3.  TSSO ALLOWS AN OPERATOR TO SPECIFY INITIALIZATION  "PROM
                MODE  AS AN OPERAND ON THE START COMMAND. TSSO WILL GO I
                "PROMPT" MODE IF AN "*" IS DETECTED  IMMEDIATELY  PRIOR
                THE  PARMLIB MEMBER SPECIFICATION ON THE START COMMAND.
                EXAMPLE, THE COMMAND

                   S TSSO,PARM='*TSSODECK'


                WILL     START     TSSO     USING      PARAMETERS      F
                'SYS1.PARMLIB(TSSODECK)',  AND  PLACE TSSO IN "PROMPT" M
                FOLLOWING THE READING OF THE PARAMETER INPUT. THE COMMAN


                  S TSSO,PARM='*'


                WILL FORCE TSSO INTO PROMPT MODE AFTER  READING  PARAMET
                FROM THE DEFAULT INITIALIZATION DECK (TSSOPARM).  NOTE T
                IF BOTH NEW OPERANDS (PROMPT  MODE  AND  FORCE  START)
                REQUIRED,  THE '/' MUST BE SPECIFIED FIRST, FOLLOWED BY
                '*', FOLLOWED  BY  THE  NAME  OF  THE  SYS1.PARMLIB  MEM











          MEMORANDUM FOR FILE - 7                        SEPTEMBER 16, 1




                SPECIFYING TSSO PARAMETERS.

            4.  TSSO NOW CONTAINS A MODULE THAT WILL GET CONTROL AT MVS
                TIME,  AND OBTAIN STORAGE FOR A NEW CONTROL BLOCK, THE T
                NON DISRUPTABLE SYSTEM AREA (TSSONDSA). THIS CONTROL  BL
                KEEPS STATUS FLAGS ACROSS TSSO RESTARTS. INSTALLATIONS M
                MAKE A SMALL CHANGE TO THE IEFSSNXX MEMBER OF  SYS1.PARM
                TO SUPPORT THIS CHANGE.

                IF THIS CHANGE IS NOT MADE, TSSO WILL INITIALIZE THIS FI
                WHEN STARTED, HOWEVER, THE BENEFITS FROM THE NEXT FEATUR
                (#5) WILL NOT BE REALIZED.

            5.  TSSO WILL NOW DEFAULT TO USE THE PRIMARY SUBSYSTEM (JES2
                JES3)  FOR  SERVICES.  IN  PREVIOUS  RELEASES  OF TSSO,
                SUB=JES2 COMMAND NEEDED TO BE INCLUDED ON THE START COMM
                FOR THIS TO HAPPEN. THE COMMAND


                   S TSSO,SUB=MSTR


                WILL  ALLOW  TSSO  TO  INITIALIZE   WITHOUT   THE   PRIM
                SUBSYSTEM.

            6.  TSSO  4.3  NOW  SUPPORTS  RESTART  PROCESSING.  IF  IT
                NECESSARY  TO  FORCE  START  TSSO (AS DESCRIBED ABOVE),
                INACTIVE TSSO ADDRESS SPACE MAY BE CANCELLED. NOTE THAT
                INACTIVE  TSSO  DOES NOT RELINQUISH ITS SUBSYSTEM CONSOL
                AND THEREFORE, IT IS NOT ADVISABLE TO  FORCE  START  UNL
                ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.

            7.  THE TSSO INITIALIZATION ROUTINE IS COMPLETELY REWRITTEN
                TSSO  4.3.  THE  NEW  ROUTINE  ONLY  ACCESSES KEY ZERO W
                ABSOLUTELY REQUIRED.

          CONCLUSION

          THIS DOCUMENT SUMMARIZES THE ENHANCEMENTS MADE TO TSSO IN VERS
          4.3.  ANY  AND  ALL COMMENTS, COMPLAINTS, SUGGESTIONS OR REQUE
          MAY BE DIRECTED TO THE AUTHOR AT (201) 981-2796.
