00000300WRITE     THE COMMAND PROCEDURES IN THIS DATASET HAVE BEEN SELECTED
00000400WRITE FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS:
00000500WRITE
00000600WRITE A) THEY MIGHT PROVE USEFUL TO SOMEONE ELSE.
00000700WRITE B) SOME CONTAIN TECHNIQUES DEVELOPED OVER SEVERAL YEARS WHICH
00000800WRITE    OTHERS MIGHT NOT HAVE DISCOVERED.
00000900WRITE C) SOME CONTAIN INTERESTING OR HUMOROUS INFORMATION.
00001000WRITE D) MOST WERE FUN TO WRITE, AND I AM HOPING TO STIMULATE
00001100WRITE    INTEREST IN COMMAND PROCEDURE WRITING AS AN ART FORM.
00001200WRITE E) I AM HOPING THAT PERHAPS THERE ARE OTHER INSTALLATIONS
00001300WRITE    WITH CLISTS THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO INCLUDE IN THIS
00001400WRITE    COLLECTION.
00001500WRITE
00001600WRITE      THESE COMMAND PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED UNDER
00001700WRITE MVS 3.7 (PUT 7811), INCLUDING SU11 - THE TSO COMMAND PACKAGE.
00001800WRITE SEVERAL OF THEM ARE DEPENDANT UPON OTHERS - HOWEVER THEY WILL
00001900WRITE RUN IF THE ENTIRE LIBRARY IS ALLOCATED TO SYSPROC - WITH THE
00002000WRITE FOLLOWING EXCEPTION: MEMBER "PFKEYS" IS AN ECHO CLIST TESTING
00002100WRITE THE KOMM COMMAND. KOMM MAY BE FOUND ON THE CBT MODS TAPE.
00002200WRITE
00002300WRITE COMMENTS: IN CERTAIN TABLE DEFINITIONS, A NUMERIC STRING WILL
00002400WRITE CONTAIN EITHER A BLANK OR AN "X". THIS TO CIRCUMVENT A PROBLEM
00002500WRITE THAT AROSE WITH SU11. THE CLIST PROCESSOR INSISTS UPON EVALUATING
00002600WRITE NUMERIC STRINGS, AND THEN GENERATING AN ERROR. THE EXTRA CHARACTER
00002700WRITE FORCES DATATYPE TO "CHAR".
00002800WRITE      SEVERAL OF THE CLISTS ARE DESIGNED TO RUN UNDER TSO EDIT
00002900WRITE ONLY. THEY WON'T WORK FROM READY.
00003000WRITE      IT WOULD BEHOOVE ONE TO READ THE COMMENTS (AND EVEN THE CODE)
00003100WRITE PRIOR TO INVOKING THE COMMAND. CAVEAT EMPTOR.
00003200WRITE      MANY OF THE CLISTS HAVE "HELP" BUILT INTO THEM. READ MEMBER
00003300WRITE "BLDHELP" FOR EXPLANATION OF HOW THIS WORKS.
00003400WRITE      REGARDING "BLDHELP" AND "BLDJCL", THESE WERE DEVELOPED FOR
00003500WRITE A MULTI-ACCESS SPOOL ENVIRONMENT. THEY AVOID VOLUME RESERVE
00003600WRITE PROBLEMS AND ARE ADMITTEDLY A DATASET INTEGRITY EXPOSURE. WE
00003700WRITE ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF CLOSING THIS EXPOSURE.
00003800WRITE
00003900WRITE =>  I WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE ANY COMMENTS, CRITICISMS, OR
00004000WRITE     ADDITIONS REGARDIN THIS STUFF. I AM A MEMBER OF THE TSO
00004100WRITE     PROJECT, AND CHAIRMAN OF THA "RATSO" COMMITTEE. ANY
00004200WRITE     CORRESPONDENCE SHOULD BE ADDRESSED TO:
