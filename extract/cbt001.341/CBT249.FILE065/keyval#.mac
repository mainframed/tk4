         1.   KEYWORD PARSING AND VALIDATION
+        __   _______ _______ ___ __________


      THIS ROUTINE HAS BEEN DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A GENERALIZED KEYWORD VA
   DATION SERVICE FOR USE BY ANY PROGRAM MODULE REQUIRING KEYWORD VALIDA
   TION SERVICES.  A CHARACTER STRING IS PASSED TO THIS ROUTINE CONTAINI
   ONE OR MORE 'KEYWORD(VALUE)' ITEMS SEPERATED BY COMMAS OR BLANKS.  TH
   PASSED STRING IS MATCHED WITH A KEYWORD VALIDATION TABLE.  THE KEYWOR
   VALIDATION TABLE DEFINES WHAT IS TO OCCUR WHEN A PARTICULAR KEYWORD I
   THE TABLE MATCHES WITH A KEYWORD IN THE STRING.  THE CODE GENERATED B
   THIS ROUTINE IS REENTRANT AND DOES A GETMAIN.  THE FOLLOWING SERVICES
   MAY BE REQUESTED WHEN A KEYWORD MATCH OCCURS:

   ..JUST OFF
      -  MOVE THE KEYWORD VALUES,  IF THERE ARE ANY,  TO AN AREA DESIGNA
        BY THE  CALLER.    THE  FORMAT  OF  THIS  AREA  IS  DEFINED  BEL
      -  INVOKE A USER ROUTINE  TO PROCESS A PARTICULAR  KEYWORD WHEN IT
        FOUND IN THE CHARACTER STRING.
      -  VALIDATE KEYWORD VALUES  FOUND FOR THE  FOLLOWING CHARACTERISTI
        - NUMERIC ONLY
        - ALPHABETIC ONLY
        - ALPHABETIC, NUMERIC, AND THE CHARACTERS @ # . $ *
        - MIN-MAX COUNT OF NUMBER OF KEYWORD VALUES SPECIFIED
      -  PERFORM THE FOLLOWING STORAGE-TO-STORAGE OPERATIONS WHEN A KEYW
        IS FOUND:
        - MVC
        - NC
        - OC
        - XC
        THIS  PERMITS THE SETTING OR RESETTING OF FLAGS AND THE MOVEMENT
        DATA WHEN A PARTICULAR KEYWORD IS FOUND.

   THE FORMAT OF THE INPUT CHARACTER STRING EXPECTED TO BE RECEIVED BY T
   ROUTINE IS AS FOLLOWS:

         LLKEYWORD(VALUE,VALUE,...),KEYWORD(VALUE,...) /* COMMENT */

      -  LL SPECIFIES THE LENGTH OF  THE INPUT CHARACTER STRING  AND IS
        BYTE HEX FIELD.    THE MAXIMUM  LENGTH WHICH  CAN BE  SPECIFIED
        X'FFFF'=65,535.
      - A KEYWORD CANNOT BE GREATER THAN 255 BYTES IN LENGTH.
      -  A KEYWORD  VALUE CANNOT  BE GREATER  THAN  255  BYTES  IN  LENG
      -  KEYWORDS MAY BE SEPERATED BY ONE OR MORE BLANKS OR A SINGLE COM
      - VALUES MAY BE SEPARATED ONLY BY COMMAS.    ANY  EMBEDDED BLANKS
        CONSIDERED AS PART OF THE VALUE.
      -  COMMENTS MAY APPEAR  BETWEEN ANY KEYWORDS  WHICH ARE  SEPARATED
        BLANKS.   COMMENTS MUST BE PRECEEDED  AND FOLLOWED BY  AT LEAST
        BLANK.
      - THE CHARACTERS  , ) '   CANNOT  APPEAR IN ANY VALUE UNLESS ENCLO
        IN SINGLE PARENTHESES.   A SINGLE PARENTHESIS  CAN ALSO BE GIVEN
        INDICATING 2 SINGLE PARENTHESES IN A ROW.
        EX: GO('WARM,COLD,''FORMAT''') WOULD INDICATE A SINGLE VALUE
            FOR THE KEYWORD GO AND THAT BALUE WOULD BE   WARM,COLD,'FORM
        EX: GO('(WARM)',COLD,FORMAT)   WOULD  INDICATE  3  VALUES  FOR
            KEYWORD GO AND THEY WOULD BE  (WARM)  COLD  FORMAT  .
