         1 INTRODUCTION
+        _ ____________

        SMART  IS DESIGNED TO ALLOW  USERS TO PRODUCE  AND MAINTAIN MANU
   OR REPORTS.   SMART WILL  AUTOMATICALLY PRODUCE  THE TABLE  OF CONTEN
   PRINT PAGE HEADINGS,  PRODUCE AN INDEX,  CHECK WORD SPELLING,  AND OT
   FACILITIES  WHICH ARE  DESIGNED TO  MAKE DOCUMENTING  AN  EASIER  CHO
   SMART IS NOT A TEXT EDITOR, ONLY A MANUAL PRINTER.  THEREFORE,  YOU W
   NEED A TEXT EDITOR, SUCH A TSO EDIT, TO CREATE YOUR REPORT.    THE IN
   TO SMART IS A 80 BYTE RECORD IN WHICH ONLY THE FIRST 72 COLUMNS ARE U
   THEREFORE THE MAXIMUM LINE WIDTH IS 72. ALTHOUGH THIS MANUAL IS IN UP
   CASE, MANUALS MAY HAVE EITHER UPPER OR LOWER CASE CHARACTERS. IF YOU
   USING TSO SPF EDIT, THE TE, TS,  AND TF COMMANDS ARE VERY HELPFUL AND
   MAY BE WISE FOR YOU TO INVESTIGATE THE USE OF THESE COMMANDS.  SMART
   DESIGNED  TO WORK ON THE IBM 3800 LASER PRINTER,  BUT THERE IS NO REA
   WHY IT  SHOULD NOT WORK  PROPERLY ON ANY  OTHER TYPE  OF PRINTER.
   PROGRAM NUMBER FOR SMART IS SFT8MV74.

        ANY  COMMENTS AND/OR  CRITICISMS OF  THIS MANUAL  WOULD BE  GREA
   APPRECIATED.  IF YOU HAVE AND IDEAS FOR IMPROVEMENTS FOR SMART,  I WO
   BE VERY RECEPTIVE TO THEM. PLEASE SEND YOUR COMMENTS TO JIM COOK, D/0
   B/17F.

         2.1 NORMAL JCL
+        ___ ______ ___

        THERE ARE THREE DD CARDS WHICH ARE REQUIRED TO EXECUTE SMART.  T
   ARE SYSUT1, SYSUT2, AND SYSUT3.  SYSUT1  IS THE INPUT DATASET CONTAIN
   THE RAW TEXT. SYSUT2 IS THE OUTPUT DATASET CONTAINING THE OUTPUT REPO
   THE  DEFAULT DCB  ATTRIBUTES FOR  SYSUT2 IS  RECFM=FBA BLKSIZE=1330
   LRECL=133 UNLESS PARM OPTION L IS SPECIFIED, THEN THE DEFAULT ATTRIBU
   ARE  RECFM=FBA LRECL=80  AND BLKSIZE=3120.  YOU CAN  OVERRIDE THESE
   ATTRIBUTES  BY SPECIFYING THE DCB INFORMATION ON THE JCL DDCARD.  IF
   OMIT SOME INFORMATION, THE DEFAULT VALUE(S) WILL BE USED. IF YOU WISH
   OUTPUT THE MANUAL TO A DATASET, YOU CAN POINT THE SYSUT2 DD CARD TO T
   DATASET AND SMART WILL USE ITS DCB ATTRIBUTES. SYSUT3 IS A WORK DATAS
   BELOW  IS A SAMPLE JCL STREAM  WHICH CAN BE USED  TO CREATE THIS MANU

                     //JOBCARD JOB 123456,USER,CLASS=E,MSGCLASS=Z
                     //SMART   EXEC  PGM=SFT8MV74
                     //SYSUT1  DD    DSN=SFT.SMART.MANUALS(SMART),DISP=S
                     //SYSUT2  DD    SYSOUT=N,CHARS=TN
                     //SYSUT3  DD    UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(CYL,(1,1))
                     //WORDS   DD    DSN=SFT.SMART.MANUALS(WORDS),DISP=S

   OTHER  DD CARDS MAY BE  REQUIRED IF YOUR MANUAL  HAS INCLUDE PROCESSI
   INCLUDE  PROCESSING WILL BE DISCUSSED LATER IN THIS DOCUMENT.  THE WO
   DD  CARD IS  ONLY NEEDED  IF  SPELLING  CHECKING  IS  TO  BE  PERFORM

       THERE ARE EIGHT PARAMETERS WHICH MAY BE SPECIFIED THROUGH THE USE
   THE PARM=  OPERAND ON  THE EXECUTE STATEMENT.  BELOW IS A  LIST OF TH
   PARMS AND THEIR MEANING:

      T - DO NOT PRODUCE A TABLE OF CONTENTS

      I - DO NOT PRODUCE THE INDEX

      R - DO NOT PRODUCE THE REPORT PART OF THE MANUAL

      S - PRODUCE STATISTICS ABOUT THE MANUAL

      A - PRINT ALL INDEX WORDS WHETHER FOUND OR NOT

      C - DON'T PRODUCE THE COVER PAGE

      L -  DON'T CENTER THE  MANUAL ON THE PAPER.  SHIFT THE  MANUAL TO
          LEFT.  THIS WILL  CAUSE THE  RIGHT  MARGIN  TO  BE  LARGE  UNL
          NARROW PAPER IS USED.

      M - PRODUCE A CROSS REFERENCE OF MISSPELLED WORDS ON THE LAST PAGE
          THE MANUAL.  IF  THERE  ARE  NO  MISSPELLED  WORDS,  OR  SPELL
          CHECKING  IS NOT ON,  THE CROSS REFERENCE  WILL NOT  BE PRODUC

   FOR EXAMPLE:  //  EXEC  PGM=SFT8MV74,PARM=AST   LIST  ALL  INDEX  WOR

+        ___ ________ ___

        THERE IS A PROGRAM,  BFGROTAT,  WHICH WILL TAKE  PRINTED OUTPUT
   ROTATE IT 90 DEGREES. BFGROTAT IS THE LOCAL NAME FOR THE SHARE MODS T
   PROGRAM IEBROT.   THIS CAN  ONLY BE USED  WHEN PRINTING  ON AN  IBM 3
   LASER PRINTER.   THIS PROGRAM CAN BE USED  WITH SMART TO PRODUCE MANU
   THAT  PRINT ROTATED ON THE PAPER SO THAT  THE MANUALS WILL BE IN BOOK
   FORM.  BELOW IS THE JCL WHICH  MAY BE USED TO PRINT  A MANUAL IN ROTA

   BETWEEN EACH INDEX WORD. IF OMITTED,  THE DEFAULT DELIMITER IS THE CO
   (,). THE ONLY RESTRICTION OF THE DELIMITER CHARACTER IS THAT IT CAN'T
   A  SPACE OR A NUMBER.  THE NEXT OPERAND,  IF SPECIFIED IS  THE AMOUNT
   STORAGE  TO BE AQUIRED FOR THE INDEX PROCESSING.  THE  DEFAULT AMOUNT
   30000 BYTES. ANY AMOUNT MAY BE SPECIFIED, BUT IT MUST BE MORE THAN 10
   BYTES.  IF THE INDEX PROCESSING  RUNS OUT OF STORAGE,  THE  PROGRAM W

   LINE IN A PARAGRAPH ARE NOT JUSTIFIED IF IT DOES NOT END CLOSE ENOUGH
   THE RIGHT MARGIN (LIKE THIS LINE).

        THE LEFT MARGIN IS ALWAYS LEFT ALONE.
                 SO YOU CAN DO WIERD THINGS LIKE THIS.
        AND  YOU WILL NOT LOSE THE  EFFECT OF THIS LINE  BY HAVING THE L

   THERE ARE TWO OPERANDS WHICH MAY BE PUT ON THE STARTING /*JUST CARD.
   FIRST OPERAND IS EITHER A 'C' OR A 'S' (WITHOUT THE QUOTES) WHICH MAY
   USED  TO SPECIFY THE START OF THE LEFT MARGIN.  THE  SECOND OPERAND I
   NUMERIC  VALUE ASSOCIATED WITH THE C OR S.  THE  C OPERAND SPECIFIES
   STARTING COLUMN.  WORDS TO  THE LEFT OF  THIS COLUMN ARE  LEFT ALONE
   WORDS TO THE RIGHT OF THIS COLUMN ARE JUSTIFIED. THE S OPERAND SPECIF
   THAT  THE JUSTIFICATION SHOULD START WITH THE  FIRST WORD WHICH DOES
   HAVE  AT LEAST N SPACES  FOLLOWING A WORD,  WHERE N IS  SPECIFIED IN
   SECOND OPERAND.  EXAMPLES OF THE /*JUST COMMAND IS:

   /*JUST          START NORMAL JUSTIFICATION.
   /*JUST S 3      STARTS JUSTIFICATION WITH THE FIRST WORDS WHICH DOES
                   AT LEAST 3 SPACES FOLLOWING IT.
   /*JUST C 20     STARTS JUSTIFICATION IN COLUMN 20.

   NOTE:   THE  SECOND  /*JUST  CARD  IN  A  GROUP  (THE  ONE  WHICH  TU
          JUSTIFICATION OFF)  DOES NOT  CONTAIN ANY OPERANDS.  ALL OPERA
          ARE IGNORED,  SO IT WOULD BE A  GOOD IDEA TO SPECIFY '/*JUST O
          SO  THAT IT IS CLEAR  TO YOU OR ANYONE  ELSE UPDATING YOUR MAN
          THAT YOU ARE TURNING JUSTIFICATION OFF.

   NUMBER  GREATER THAN  OR EQUAL  TO THE  NUMBER SPECFIED  ON THE  /*LE
   COMMAND,  WILL BE MARKED  WITH A ×  IN FRONT OF  THAT LINE.  THIS ALL
   USERS  TO EASILY DISTINGUISH CHANGES  FROM THE LAST VERSION.  AN EXAM

        THE  /*SPELL COMMAND PROVIDES A MEANS TO CHECK THE SPELLING OF Y
   MANUAL.  PRESENTLY SMART CONTAINS A DATABASE OF  ABOUT 3000 WORDS AND
   GROWING BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS.  SMART CHECKS  THE SPELLING OF THE WORDS
   YOUR  MANUAL AND COMPARES IT WITH THIS LIST.  IF THE  WORD IS NOT WIT
   THIS LIST, THE WORD IS CONSIDERED TO BE MISSPELLED AND IS UNDERLINED
   THE  LINE THE WORD  IS CONTAINED  ON IS  PRECEDED BY  AN ASTERISK.  O
   STRING  OF LETTERS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE WORDS BY SMART.  THAT IS,  WO
   WHICH CONTAIN NUMBERS AND OR SPECIAL CHARACTERS ARE CONSIDERED MORE T
   ONE WORD. FOR EXAMPLE,  THE WORD SFT8MV74  WOULD BE CONSIDERED TWO WO
   BY SMART, THE WORDS ARE SFT AND MV.  MOST MANUALS HAVE SPECIAL WORDS
   ABBREVIATIONS  WHICH ARE UNIQUE TO THAT MANUAL.  THEY MAY BE INCLUDED
   THE  WORD LIST ONLY FOR THAT MANUAL.  THESE  WORDS SHOULD BE  PUT ON
   CARDS FOLLOWING THE /*SPELL COMMAND.  MORE THAN ONE WORD CAN BE PUT O
   CARD  AND THEY ARE TO BE SEPARATED BY A SPACE.  ONCE  ALL OF THE SPEC
   WORDS HAVE BEEN ENTERED,  THEY  SHOULD BE FOLLOWED BY  A /*SPELL CARD
   INFORM  SMART THAT THE END  OF THE SPECIAL WORDS  HAVE BEEN REACHED.
   YOUR MANUAL DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY SPECIAL WORDS, OR YOU WISH TO SEE WH
   WORDS  YOU NEED TO ADD TO YOUR WORD DATABASE,  YOU WILL NEED TO HAVE
   /*SPELL CARDS IN A ROW.
        THERE  MAY BE ONE OPERAND  TO THE SPELL COMMAND.  IT  IS THE NUM
   OF  BYTES TO BE USED FOR SPELLING CHECKING.  THE  DEFAULT VALUE IS 10

     UNUSED STORAGE - THE AMOUNT OF UNUSED STORAGE FOR INDEX DATA.

     WORDS SEARCHED - THE NUMBER OF WORDS IN YOU MANUAL.

     NO OF COMPARES - THE TOTAL NUMBER OF COMPARES NEEDED TO SEE IF THE
                      WORDS ARE IN  THE INDEX.   THE AVERAGE  NUMBER OF
                      COMPARES FOR EACH WORD IS THIS NUMBER  DIVIDED BY
                      WORDS SEARCHED.

     NO INDEX WORDS - THE NUMBER OF WORDS IN YOU INDEX.

      INDEX ENTRIES - THE NUMBER OF TIMES A WORD WAS FOUND IN THE INDEX.

   THE NEXT SECTION PERTAINS TO THE SPELLING CHECKING.

       MISSPELLINGS - THE NUMBER OF MISSPELLED WORDS.

     NO SPELL WORDS - THE NUMBER OF WORDS IN THE SPELLING DICTIONARY

      SPELL MAX SRC - THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF COMPARES NEEDED TO DETERMINE
                      WHETHER A WORD WAS MISSPELLED OR NOT.

     SPELL COMPARES - THE TOTAL NUMBER OF  COMPARES NEEDED TO  SEE IF WO
                      ARE MISSPELLED.  THE AVERAGE  NUMBER OF  COMPARES
                      EACH WORD IS THIS FIELD DIVIDED BY THE WORDS SEARC
                      FIELD.

   THE LAST SECTION,  LETTER OCCURRENCES,  TELLS HOW MANY  WORDS BEGIN W
   THE INDICATED LETTER.  IF THE  LETTER IS PRECEDED  BY AN ASTERISK,  I
   LETTER THAT CONTAINS INDEX ENTRIES.

        THE  EFFICIENCY OF SMART  IS IN  PART DETERMINED  BY THE  NUMBER
   INDEX AND SPELL COMPARES.  THE  FEWER THE COMPARES,  THE  MORE EFFICI
   SMART IS.  THIS  EFFICIENCY CAN  BE INCREASE  BY INCREASING  THE STOR
   ASSIGNED TO EACH FUNCTION.
