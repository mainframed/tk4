 MEMBER     DESCRIPTION
--------   -------------------------------------------------------------

#JC      - CMD SUBSYSTEM #J REPLACEMENT. THIS #J ALLOWS THE OPTION #JC
           WHICH WAITS FIVE SECONDS AND DISPLAYS EACH JOB AND THEIR
           CPU PERCENTAGE IN A FORMAT SIMILAR TO THE NORMAL #J.

CLOKSYNC - THIS JOB ISSUES THE OPERATOR COMMAND  T TIME=  TO
           SYNCHRONIZE THE TIMES ON TWO LOOSELY COUPLED MACHINES.
           THIS JOB NEEDS TO BE KICKED OFF ON BOTH MACHINES AND
           IT COMMUNICATES THROUGH A BDAM DATASET. ONE OF THE MACHINES
           WILL HAVE ITS TIME SET TO THE OTHER MACHINES.

CMDEXEC  - A PROGRAM WHICH TAKES OPERATOR COMMANDS AS EXECUTE PARMS
           ISSUES THEM VIA SVC34.

IEFUJV   - SMF JOB VERIFY EXIT. THIS EXIT SCANS EXEC JCL STATEMENTS
           LOOKING FOR PROC NAMES. WHEN PROC NAMES ARE FOUND, THEY
           ARE RECORDED BY WRITING AN SMF RECORD. THIS EXIT WAS USED
           TO CLEAN UP OUR PROCLIBS. WE INSTALLED THIS EXIT FOR ABOUT
           SIX MONTHS, PROCESSED THE SMF DATA, AND FOUND THAT WE COULD
           DELETE ABOUT 1/3 OF OUR PROCS.

INFOMOD  - A MOD TO IBM'S INFO SYSTEMS WHICH ALOWS IT TO BE RUN IN A
           BATCH ENVIRONMENT.

KEYVAL   - A KEYWORD VALIDATION ROUTINE USED TO PARSE KEYWORDS AND
           VALUES RECEIVED AS INPUT INTO A PROGRAM.  THIS PROGRAM IS
           INVOKED USING TWO MACROS. THE FIRST -- KEYVAL -- IS USED
           TO INVOKE THE ROUTINE AND GENERATES AN INLINE CSECT WHEN
           FIRST USED.  OTHER USES IN A PROGRAM USE THE FIRST COPY.
           THE SECOND MACRO -- KEYT -- IS USED TO BUILD A KEYWORD
           VALIDATION TABLE THAT TELLS WHAT TO DO WHEN A KEYWORD
           MATCH IS FOUND.  THIS ROUTINE IS REENTRANT.  THE TWO MACROS
           GIVEN HERE MAY BE USED INLINE OR PLACED INTO A MACLIB.

SMART    - SMART IS A MANUAL FORMATING PROGRAM. SMART WILL AUTOMATICALLY
           PRODUCE A TABLE OF CONTENTS, INDEX, AND CHECK THE SPELLING OF
           WORDS.

WHICH    - APPLICABLE TO LOOSELY COUPLED MULTI-PROCESSING SYSTEMS. THIS
           PROGRAM MAY BE EXECUTED AS A JOB STEP AND GIVES A RETURN CODE
           DEPENDING ON WHICH SYSTEM IT IS RUNNING ON. THIS RETURN CODE
           MAY BE INTERROGATED BY THE COND JCL PARAMETER ON SUBSEQUENT
           STEPS TO DETERMINE IF THAT STEP IS THE RUN ON THAT SYSTEM.
           USEFUL FOR DAILY MAINTENCE JOBS, SUCH AS SMFDUMPS ETC. THE
           SAME JOBNAME MAY BE EXECUTED ON EACH SYSTEM AND ONLY THE
           CORRECT STEPS WILL BE RUN DEPENDING ON THE SYSTEM.

WORDS    - SPELLING WORDS DATABASE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH SMART.
