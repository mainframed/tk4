/*SEC 1 INTRODUCTION
/*JUST
     SMART IS DESIGNED TO ALLOW USERS TO PRODUCE AND MAINTAIN MANUALS
OR REPORTS.  SMART WILL AUTOMATICALLY PRODUCE THE TABLE OF CONTENTS,
PRINT PAGE HEADINGS, PRODUCE AN INDEX, CHECK WORD SPELLING, AND OTHER
FACILITIES WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO MAKE DOCUMENTING AN EASIER CHORE.
SMART IS NOT A TEXT EDITOR, ONLY A MANUAL PRINTER.  THEREFORE, YOU WILL
NEED A TEXT EDITOR, SUCH A TSO EDIT, TO CREATE YOUR REPORT.  THE INPUT
TO SMART IS A 80 BYTE RECORD IN WHICH ONLY THE FIRST 72 COLUMNS ARE USE,
THEREFORE THE MAXIMUM LINE WIDTH IS 72. ALTHOUGH THIS MANUAL IS IN UPPER
CASE, MANUALS MAY HAVE EITHER UPPER OR LOWER CASE CHARACTERS. IF YOU ARE
USING TSO SPF EDIT, THE TE, TS, AND TF COMMANDS ARE VERY HELPFUL AND IT
MAY BE WISE FOR YOU TO INVESTIGATE THE USE OF THESE COMMANDS. SMART WAS
DESIGNED TO WORK ON THE IBM 3800 LASER PRINTER, BUT THERE IS NO REASON
WHY IT SHOULD NOT WORK PROPERLY ON ANY OTHER TYPE OF PRINTER.  THE
PROGRAM NUMBER FOR SMART IS SFT8MV74.

     ANY COMMENTS AND/OR CRITICISMS OF THIS MANUAL WOULD BE GREATLY
APPRECIATED. IF YOU HAVE AND IDEAS FOR IMPROVEMENTS FOR SMART, I WOULD
BE VERY RECEPTIVE TO THEM. PLEASE SEND YOUR COMMENTS TO JIM COOK, D/0058
B/17F.
..SEC 2 SMART JCL
..SEC 2.1 NORMAL JCL
     THERE ARE THREE DD CARDS WHICH ARE REQUIRED TO EXECUTE SMART. THEY
ARE SYSUT1, SYSUT2, AND SYSUT3. SYSUT1 IS THE INPUT DATASET CONTAINING
THE RAW TEXT. SYSUT2 IS THE OUTPUT DATASET CONTAINING THE OUTPUT REPORT.
THE DEFAULT DCB ATTRIBUTES FOR SYSUT2 IS RECFM=FBA BLKSIZE=1330 AND
LRECL=133 UNLESS PARM OPTION L IS SPECIFIED, THEN THE DEFAULT ATTRIBUTES
ARE RECFM=FBA LRECL=80 AND BLKSIZE=3120. YOU CAN OVERRIDE THESE DCB
ATTRIBUTES BY SPECIFYING THE DCB INFORMATION ON THE JCL DDCARD. IF YOU
OMIT SOME INFORMATION, THE DEFAULT VALUE(S) WILL BE USED. IF YOU WISH TO
OUTPUT THE MANUAL TO A DATASET, YOU CAN POINT THE SYSUT2 DD CARD TO THAT
DATASET AND SMART WILL USE ITS DCB ATTRIBUTES. SYSUT3 IS A WORK DATASET.
BELOW IS A SAMPLE JCL STREAM WHICH CAN BE USED TO CREATE THIS MANUAL.

..JUST OFF

                  //WORDS   DD    DSN=SFT.SMART.MANUALS(WORDS),DISP=SHR
..JUST

OTHER DD CARDS MAY BE REQUIRED IF YOUR MANUAL HAS INCLUDE PROCESSING.
INCLUDE PROCESSING WILL BE DISCUSSED LATER IN THIS DOCUMENT. THE WORDS
DD CARD IS ONLY NEEDED IF SPELLING CHECKING IS TO BE PERFORMED.

    THERE ARE EIGHT PARAMETERS WHICH MAY BE SPECIFIED THROUGH THE USE OF
THE PARM= OPERAND ON THE EXECUTE STATEMENT. BELOW IS A LIST OF THESE
PARMS AND THEIR MEANING:

   T - DO NOT PRODUCE A TABLE OF CONTENTS

   I - DO NOT PRODUCE THE INDEX

   R - DO NOT PRODUCE THE REPORT PART OF THE MANUAL

   S - PRODUCE STATISTICS ABOUT THE MANUAL

   A - PRINT ALL INDEX WORDS WHETHER FOUND OR NOT

   C - DON'T PRODUCE THE COVER PAGE

   L - DON'T CENTER THE MANUAL ON THE PAPER. SHIFT THE MANUAL TO THE
       LEFT. THIS WILL CAUSE THE RIGHT MARGIN TO BE LARGE UNLESS
       NARROW PAPER IS USED.

   M - PRODUCE A CROSS REFERENCE OF MISSPELLED WORDS ON THE LAST PAGE OF
       THE MANUAL. IF THERE ARE NO MISSPELLED WORDS, OR SPELLING
       CHECKING IS NOT ON, THE CROSS REFERENCE WILL NOT BE PRODUCED.

FOR EXAMPLE:  // EXEC PGM=SFT8MV74,PARM=AST  LIST ALL INDEX WORDS,
              PRODUCE MANUAL STATISTICS, AND THE TABLE OF CONTENTS
              WILL NOT BE PRODUCED.
..SEC 2.2 ROTATION JCL
     THERE IS A PROGRAM, BFGROTAT, WHICH WILL TAKE PRINTED OUTPUT AND
ROTATE IT 90 DEGREES. BFGROTAT IS THE LOCAL NAME FOR THE SHARE MODS TAPE
PROGRAM IEBROT.  THIS CAN ONLY BE USED WHEN PRINTING ON AN IBM 3800
LASER PRINTER.  THIS PROGRAM CAN BE USED WITH SMART TO PRODUCE MANUALS
THAT PRINT ROTATED ON THE PAPER SO THAT THE MANUALS WILL BE IN BOOKLET
FORM. BELOW IS THE JCL WHICH MAY BE USED TO PRINT A MANUAL IN ROTATED
FORM. THERE ARE TWO MINOR DETAILS IN THE JCL BELOW THAT SHOULD NOT BE
LEFT OUT, THE /*JOBPARM CARD AND THE PARM=L ON THE SMART EXEC STATEMENT.

/*SEC 3 SMART COMMANDS
      ALL SMART COMMANDS MUST START IN COLUMN 1 AND ARE SIGNIFIED BY A
SLASH ASTERISK (/*) OR A PERIOD PERIOD (..).  SMART COMMANDS MAY OR MAY
NOT REQUIRE OPERANDS WHICH ARE SEPARATED BY 1 SPACE.  ANY INPUT RECORD
WHICH CONTAINS A /* OR .. IN COLUMNS 1 AND 2 AND IS NOT A COMMAND, IS
PROCESSED AS A NORMAL INPUT RECORD.  ALL COMMANDS IN THIS MANUAL ARE
PREFIXED BY THE /*, BUT THEY COULD HAVE BEEN PREFIXED BY A .. .  ALSO,
COMMANDS MAY BE ENTERED IN EITHER UPPER OR LOWER CASE. IT IS RECOMMENDED
THAT THE USER USE .. TO DISTINGUISH THE COMMANDS. THAT WAY SYSUT1 CAN BE
//SYSUT1 DD * INSTEAD OF //SYSUT1 DD DATA. NOTE, COMMANDS DO NOT TAKE
EFFECT UNTIL THEY ARE ENCOUNTERED. FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE /*INDEX COMMAND
IS PUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DOCUMENT, THE INDEX WILL ONLY CONTAIN PAGE
NUMBERS WHICH ARE FOUND AFTER THE /*INDEX COMMAND.

     IF A COMMAND IS INVALID, SMART WILL DISPLAY THE COMMAND IN YOUR
DOCUMENT. THERE ARE SEVERAL REASONS FOR INVALID COMMANDS. EITHER THE
COMMAND IS MISSPELLED, THERE ARE INVALID OPERANDS, OR THE SYNTAX IS
INVALID. SOME COMMANDS MUST APPEAR IN PAIRS, SUCH AS /*TOP . IF YOU
FORGET TO PUT IN THE SECOND COMMAND, SOME OF THE MANUAL MAY NOT PRINT.
FINALLY, SOME COMMANDS TAKE A DEFAULT OPERATION IF THEY CONTAIN INVALID
OPERANDS. FOR EXAMPLE: /*SPACE TEN  . SINCE THE WORD TEN IS WRONG, THE
SPACE COMMAND WILL TAKE A DEFAULT OPERAND OF 1 AND PRODUCE 1 BLANK LINE.
..SEC 3.1 /*COMMENT COMMAND
     THE /*COMMENT COMMAND PROVIDES A MEANS TO PUT IN EXPLANATORY
REMARKS WHICH WILL NOT BE REPRODUCED ON THE COMPLETED DOCUMENT. THE REST
OF THE INPUT RECORD IS IGNORED AND MAY BE USED AS A COMMENT.  AN EXAMPLE
OF THE /*COMMENT COMMAND IS:

..JUST OFF
..IGNORE
/*COMMENT THIS SECTION SHOULD NOT BE UPDATED UNLESS JON DOE X3213
..IGNORE
/*COMMENT IS NOTIFIED AND HAS GRANTED HIS APPROVAL!
..JUST
..SEC 3.2 /*DATE COMMAND
     THE /*DATE COMMAND ALLOWS A USER TO SPECIFY THE DATE IN THE PAGE
TITLES.  THE OPERAND OF THE /*DATE COMMAND CAN BE UP TO 8 CHARACTERS.
IF THE OPERAND OR THE CARD IS OMITTED, THE JULIAN DATE THE DOCUMENT
IS PRINTED IS PLACED IN THE DATE FIELD OF THE PAGE TITLES. AN EXAMPLE
OF THE /*DATE COMMAND IS:

..IGNORE
/*DATE 06/23/57
..SEC 3.3 /*VERSION COMMAND
     THE /*VERSION COMMAND ALLOWS A USER TO PLACE A VERSION NUMBER IN
THE PAGE HEADINGS. THE OPERAND TO THE /*VERSION COMMAND CAN BE UP TO 5
CHARACTERS.  IF THE OPERAND OR THE /*VERSION CARD IS MISSING, THEN THE
VERSION WILL BE LEFT BLANK.  AN EXAMPLE OF THE /*VERSION COMMAND IS:

..IGNORE
/*VERSION 1.0
..SEC 3.4 /*TITLE COMMAND
     THE /*TITLE COMMAND SPECIFIES THE TITLE OF THE DOCUMENT. THE TITLE
OF THE DOCUMENT CAN BE UP TO 40 CHARACTERS LONG AND IS PLACED CENTERED
IN THE FIRST LINE OF THE PAGE HEADINGS.  IF THERE IS NO OPERAND OR THE
..IGNORE
/*TITLE CARD IS MISSING, THEN THE TITLE WILL BE LEFT BLANK. AN EXAMPLE
OF THE /*TITLE COMMAND IS:

..IGNORE
/*TITLE SMART USER GUIDE
..SEC 3.5 /*ULIN COMMAND
     THE /*ULIN COMMAND PRINTS AND UNDERLINES ALL NON-BLANKS ON THE
NEXT CARD. IF THE NEXT CARD IS A COMMAND, IT IS IGNORED AND STILL
UNDERLINED. AN EXAMPLE OF THE /*ULIN COMMAND IS:

..IGNORE
/*ULIN
        EXAMPLE OF THE ULIN COMMAND

WILL RESULT IN

..ULIN
        EXAMPLE OF THE ULIN COMMAND
..SEC 3.6 /*SPACE COMMAND
     THE /*SPACE COMMAND ALLOWS A USER TO PRINT N BLANK LINES WHERE N
IS THE OPERAND TO THE SPACE COMMAND. IF THE OPERAND IS OMITTED, N
DEFAULTS TO 1. AN EXAMPLE OF THE SPACE COMMAND IS:

..IGNORE
/*SPACE 5

WILL RESULT IN 5 BLANK LINES.
..SEC 3.7 /*IGNORE COMMAND
     THE /*IGNORE COMMAND CAUSES THE NEXT LINE TO BE PRINTED WHETHER
IT IS A COMMAND OR NOT. IF IT IS A COMMAND, THE COMMAND IS NOT
PROCESSED. AN EXAMPLE OF THE /*IGNORE COMMAND IS:

..IGNORE
/*IGNORE
..IGNORE
/*TITLE THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A TITLE COMMAND WHICH IS NOT EXECUTED
..SEC 3.8 /*NOSPACE COMMAND
     THE /*NOSPACE COMMAND CAUSES THE CHARACTERS CONTAINED IN COLUMNS
10 THRU 72 TO BE WRITTEN ON THE SAME PRINT LINE AS THE PREVIOUS LINE.
THIS PROVIDES A METHOD TO UNDERLINE CERTAIN WORDS. IF YOU WISH TO
..NOSPACE                 _________
UNDERLINE CHARACTERS WHICH APPEAR IN COLUMNS 1 THRU 9, LEAVE COLUMNS
10 THRU 72 COMPLETELY BLANK AND THE NEXT CARD WILL BE PRINTED ON THE
PREVIOUS LINE. AN EXAMPLE OF THE NOSPACE COMMAND WHICH UNDERLINED THE
WORD UNDERLINE ABOVE IS:

..JUST OFF
THIS PROVIDES A METHOD TO UNDERLINE CERTAIN WORDS. IF YOU WISH TO
..IGNORE
/*NOSPACE                 _________
..JUST
     NOTICE THAT THE UNDERLINED CHARACTERS HAVE BEEN MOVED UNDERNEATH
THE CHARACTERS WHICH THEY WERE TO UNDERLINE SINCE JUSTIFICATION IS
ON FOR THIS MANUAL. THE /*NOSPACE COMMAND MAY BE ABBREVIATED TO /*+.
USE OF THIS ABBREVIATION WILL ALLOW UNDERLINING OF ALL CHARACTERS IN
COLUMNS 4 THRU 72 USING ONLY ONE CARD.
/*SEC 3.9 /*PGSIZE COMMAND
     THE /*PGSIZE ALLOWS THE USER TO SPECIFY THE NUMBER OF LINES PER
PAGE. IF NO OPERAND IS SPECIFIED, OR THE /*PGSIZE CARD IS OMITTED, THE
DEFAULT NUMBER OF LINES IS 60. AN EXAMPLE OF THE /*PGSIZE COMMAND IS:

/*IGNORE
/*PGSIZE 55
/*SEC 3.10 /*PAGE COMMAND
     THE /*PAGE COMMAND MAY HAVE 0, 1 OR 2 OPERANDS. IF THERE IS NO
OPERAND SPECIFIED, THE NEXT LINE IS PRINTED ON THE TOP OF THE NEXT PAGE.
IF 1 OPERAND IS SPECIFIED, IT MUST BE NUMERIC AND CAUSES THE SKIP TO THE
TOP OF THE NEXT PAGE, ONLY IF THERE ARE NOT N LINES LEFT ON THIS PAGE.
THIS IS USEFUL TO GROUP CERTAIN LINES ON THE SAME PAGE.  IF THE 2ND
OPERAND IS SPECIFIED, IT MUST BE THE WORD: SPACE  AND IT SIGNALS THAT IF
THERE ARE N LINES LEFT ON THIS PAGE, PRINT A BLANK LINE AND THEN PRINT
THE NEXT N LINES ON THIS PAGE. AN EXAMPLE OF THE
..IGNORE
/*PAGE COMMAND IS:

/*IGNORE
/*PAGE 5
               - OR -
/*IGNORE
/*PAGE 5 SPACE
/*SEC 3.11 /*INCLUDE COMMAND
     THE /*INCLUDE COMMAND ALLOWS TEXT TO BE INSERTED FROM ANOTHER
SOURCE. THE DATA MAY RESIDE IN A SEQUENTIAL DATASET OR BE A MEMBER OF A
PARTITION DATASET. ALL INPUT IS RECEIVED FROM THIS NEW SOURCE AND ALL
COMMANDS ARE ALSO PROCESSED. INCLUDED TEXT MAY INCLUDE OTHER TEXT. THE
NUMBER OF LEVELS OF INCLUDES IS ONLY LIMITED BY YOU REGION SIZE.  THERE
ARE TWO FORMS OF THE /*INCLUDE COMMAND.

..JUST OFF
FORM1: /*INCLUDE DDNAME  RECEIVES INPUT FROM THE DD CARD WITH THE
                         SPECIFIED DDNAME. THIS FILE IS PROCESSED
                         SEQUENTIALLY.

FORM2: /*INCLUDE DDNAME(MEMBER)  THE DD CARD IS CONSIDERED TO POINT
                         TO A PARTITIONED DATASET  WHICH CONTAINS A
                         MEMBER AS NAMED WITHIN THE PARENTHESIS.
/*JUST

AN EXAMPLE OF THE /*INCLUDE CARD IS:

/*IGNORE
/*INCLUDE SYSLIB(PART2)

WHICH RETRIEVES THE MEMBER PART2 FROM THE LIBRARY AS SPECIFIED BY THE
DD CARD NAMED SYSLIB.
/*SEC 3.12 /*SEC COMMAND
     THE /*SEC COMMAND PROVIDES THE MEANS FOR CREATING THE TABLE OF
CONTENTS. THESE CARDS ARE TO BE PLACED IN THE TEXT TO SEPARATE THE
DIFFERENT SECTIONS. THESE SECTION NAMES ARE PLACED IN THE TABLE OF
CONTENTS ALONG WITH THE PAGE ON WHICH THEY OCCUR. THE /*SEC HAS 2
OPERANDS. THE FIRST OPERAND IS THE SECTION NUMBER. THE SECTION NUMBER
CAN BE UP TO 9 CHARACTERS LONG AND SHOULD CONTAIN PERIODS TO DESCRIBE
SUBSECTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, 5.3.1 IS THE FIRST SUBSECTION UNDER SECTION
5.3 . THE SECOND OPERAND, WHICH CAN CONTAIN IMBEDDED BLANKS, IS THE
SECTION NAME. THIS NAME IS ALSO PLACED AND CENTERED IN THE SECOND LINE
OF THE PAGE HEADINGS. AND EXAMPLE OF THE /*SEC COMMAND WHICH DESCRIBES
THIS SECTION IS:

/*IGNORE
/*SEC 3.12 /*SEC COMMAND

IF THE SECTION NUMBERS ARE REPLACED BY ASTERISKS, THE SECTION NUMBERS
WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE GENERATED. THIS ALLOWS EASY INSERTION OF NEW
SECTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, BELOW IS A LIST OF SECTION COMMANDS AND HOW THEY
WOULD BE TRANSLATED.

/*JUST OFF
       /*SEC * FIRST SECTION                   /*SEC 1 FIRST SECTION

       /*SEC * THIRD SECTION                   /*SEC 3 THIRD SECTION
/*JUST

/*SEC 3.13 /*COVER COMMAND
     THE /*COVER COMMAND PROVIDES A MEANS FOR THE USER TO CREATE AND
DESIGN A COVER FOR THE DOCUMENT. THIS COVER WILL CONTAIN NO PAGE
HEADINGS. THE START OF THE COVER PAGE IS DENOTED BY THE FIRST /*COVER
COMMAND AND THE SECOND /*COVER COMMAND DENOTES THE END OF THE COVER
PAGE. ALL COMMANDS BETWEEN THE /*COVER COMMANDS ARE IGNORED AND PRINTED.
THE /*COVER COMMANDS MUST APPEAR BEFORE ANY /*SEC OR TEXT LINE. AN
EXAMPLE OF THE /*COVER COMMAND IS:

/*IGNORE
/*COVER

/*IGNORE
/*COVER
/*SEC 3.14 /*TOP COMMAND
     THE /*TOP COMMAND CAUSES LINES TO BE PRINTED AT THE TOP OF EVERY
SUBSEQUENT PAGE. THE /*TOP COMMAND CAN BE PLACED ANYWHERE IN THE TEXT
AND BE USED OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THE ONLY RESTRICTION IS THAT THERE CAN
BE NO MORE THAN FIVE LINES. COMMANDS MAY BE CONTAINED IN THE TOP
PROCESSING AND THEY WILL BE EXECUTED. THE FIRST /*TOP COMMAND DENOTES
THE START OF THE LINES AND THE SECOND /*TOP COMMAND SIGNIFIES THE END.
TO STOP THE /*TOP PROCESSING ONCE IT HAS BEEN STARTED, TWO CONSECUTIVE
/*TOP COMMANDS WILL NEED TO BE EXECUTED. AN EXAMPLE OF THE /*IGNORE
/*TOP COMMAND IS AS FOLLOWS:

/*IGNORE
/*TOP
/*IGNORE
/*SPACE 3
THIS IS THE TOP OF A NEW PAGE
/*IGNORE
/*SPACE 3
/*IGNORE
/*TOP

THIS CAUSES 7 LINES TO BE PRINTED AT THE TOP OF EACH NEW PAGE.
/*SEC 3.15 /*INDEX COMMAND
     THE /*INDEX COMMAND SPECIFIES THAT AN INDEX IS TO BE BUILT. THE
WORDS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE INDEX ARE DESCRIBED ON THE FOLLOWING CARDS
UP TO THE NEXT /*INDEX CARD. THERE ARE UP TO TWO OPERANDS WHICH CAN BE
SPECIFIED. THE FIRST OPERAND, IF SPECIFIED, IS THE DELIMITER CHARACTER
BETWEEN EACH INDEX WORD. IF OMITTED, THE DEFAULT DELIMITER IS THE COMMA
(,). THE ONLY RESTRICTION OF THE DELIMITER CHARACTER IS THAT IT CAN'T BE
A SPACE OR A NUMBER. THE NEXT OPERAND, IF SPECIFIED IS THE AMOUNT OF
STORAGE TO BE AQUIRED FOR THE INDEX PROCESSING. THE DEFAULT AMOUNT IS
30000 BYTES. ANY AMOUNT MAY BE SPECIFIED, BUT IT MUST BE MORE THAN 10000
BYTES. IF THE INDEX PROCESSING RUNS OUT OF STORAGE, THE PROGRAM WILL
TERMINATE WITH A U0010 ABEND. AN EXAMPLE OF THE /*INDEX COMMAND WHICH IS
USED FOR THIS MANUAL IS:

/*IGNORE
/*INDEX ; 15000
U0010 ABEND;ABEND;/*SEC;/*TITLE;/*PAGE;/*ULIN;/*COVER;/*SPACE;
 /*VERSION;/*COMMENT;/*DATE;/*INCLUDE;/*INDEX;/*IGNORE;/*PGSIZE;
 /*TOP;/*NOSPACE;JCL;SMART;INDEX;CONTENTS;SYSUT;DCB;JULIAN DATE;
PARTITIONED;SEQUENTIAL;INPUT;OUTPUT;/*JUST;/*+;/*OPTION;/*LEVEL
/*IGNORE
/*INDEX
/*SEC 3.16 /*JUST COMMAND
     THE JUST COMMAND EITHER TURNS ON LINE JUSTIFICATION OR TURNS IT OFF
THE FIRST OCCURRENCE OF THE JUST COMMAND CAUSES JUSTIFICATION TO BE
TURNED ON AND THE NEXT OCCURRENCE TURNS IT OFF. THE NEXT OCCURRENCE WILL
TURN IT ON AGAIN AND SO FORTH. ONLY LINES WHICH HAVE MORE WORDS ON A
LINE THAN SPACES LEFT AFTER THE LAST WORD ARE JUSTIFIED. SO, THE LAST
LINE IN A PARAGRAPH ARE NOT JUSTIFIED IF IT DOES NOT END CLOSE ENOUGH TO
THE RIGHT MARGIN (LIKE THIS LINE).

     THE LEFT MARGIN IS ALWAYS LEFT ALONE.
              SO YOU CAN DO WIERD THINGS LIKE THIS.
     AND YOU WILL NOT LOSE THE EFFECT OF THIS LINE BY HAVING THE LEFT
     MARGIN CHANGED.

THERE ARE TWO OPERANDS WHICH MAY BE PUT ON THE STARTING /*JUST CARD. THE
FIRST OPERAND IS EITHER A 'C' OR A 'S' (WITHOUT THE QUOTES) WHICH MAY BE
USED TO SPECIFY THE START OF THE LEFT MARGIN. THE SECOND OPERAND IS A
NUMERIC VALUE ASSOCIATED WITH THE C OR S. THE C OPERAND SPECIFIES THE
STARTING COLUMN. WORDS TO THE LEFT OF THIS COLUMN ARE LEFT ALONE AND
WORDS TO THE RIGHT OF THIS COLUMN ARE JUSTIFIED. THE S OPERAND SPECIFIES
THAT THE JUSTIFICATION SHOULD START WITH THE FIRST WORD WHICH DOES NOT
HAVE AT LEAST N SPACES FOLLOWING A WORD, WHERE N IS SPECIFIED IN THE
SECOND OPERAND.  EXAMPLES OF THE /*JUST COMMAND IS:

/*IGNORE
/*JUST          START NORMAL JUSTIFICATION.
/*IGNORE
/*JUST S 3      STARTS JUSTIFICATION WITH THE FIRST WORDS WHICH DOES NOT
                AT LEAST 3 SPACES FOLLOWING IT.
/*IGNORE
/*JUST C 20     STARTS JUSTIFICATION IN COLUMN 20.

NOTE:  THE SECOND /*JUST CARD IN A GROUP (THE ONE WHICH TURNS
       JUSTIFICATION OFF) DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY OPERANDS. ALL OPERANDS
       ARE IGNORED, SO IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO SPECIFY '/*JUST OFF'
       SO THAT IT IS CLEAR TO YOU OR ANYONE ELSE UPDATING YOUR MANUAL
       THAT YOU ARE TURNING JUSTIFICATION OFF.
/*SEC *.* /*LEVEL COMMAND
     THE /*LEVEL COMMAND IS USABLE ONLY WHEN COLUMNS 79 AND 80 OF THE
INPUT RECORDS CONTAIN A MODIFICATION LEVEL NUMBER OF THAT RECORD. THIS
IS TRUE FOR DATA WHICH HAS BEEN CREATED USING TSO SPF EDIT WITH
STATISTICS ON. THE LEVEL COMMAND HAS ONE OPERAND WHICH SPECIFIES THE
MODIFICATION LEVEL NUMBER. ANY RECORDS WHICH HAVE A MODIFICATION LEVEL
NUMBER GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO THE NUMBER SPECFIED ON THE /*LEVEL
COMMAND, WILL BE MARKED WITH A × IN FRONT OF THAT LINE. THIS ALLOWS
USERS TO EASILY DISTINGUISH CHANGES FROM THE LAST VERSION. AN EXAMPLE
OF THE /*LEVEL COMMAND IS:
/*IGNORE
/*LEVEL 15

THIS WILL CAUSE ANY STATEMENTS WITH MODIFICATION LEVEL NUMBERS GREATER
THAN OR EQUAL TO 15 TO BE MARKED.
/*SEC *.* /*OPTION COMMAND
     THE /*OPTION COMMAND IS DESIGNED TO CHANGE DIFFERENT OPERATING
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MANUAL. BELOW IS A LIST OF THE OPERANDS AND
THEIR MEANING.

/*SEC *.* /*SPELL COMMAND
     THE /*SPELL COMMAND PROVIDES A MEANS TO CHECK THE SPELLING OF YOUR
MANUAL. PRESENTLY SMART CONTAINS A DATABASE OF ABOUT 3000 WORDS AND IS
GROWING BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS. SMART CHECKS THE SPELLING OF THE WORDS IN
YOUR MANUAL AND COMPARES IT WITH THIS LIST. IF THE WORD IS NOT WITHIN
THIS LIST, THE WORD IS CONSIDERED TO BE MISSPELLED AND IS UNDERLINED AND
THE LINE THE WORD IS CONTAINED ON IS PRECEDED BY AN ASTERISK. ONLY
STRING OF LETTERS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE WORDS BY SMART. THAT IS, WORDS
WHICH CONTAIN NUMBERS AND OR SPECIAL CHARACTERS ARE CONSIDERED MORE THAN
ONE WORD. FOR EXAMPLE, THE WORD SFT8MV74 WOULD BE CONSIDERED TWO WORDS
BY SMART, THE WORDS ARE SFT AND MV. MOST MANUALS HAVE SPECIAL WORDS AND
ABBREVIATIONS WHICH ARE UNIQUE TO THAT MANUAL. THEY MAY BE INCLUDED IN
THE WORD LIST ONLY FOR THAT MANUAL. THESE WORDS SHOULD BE PUT ON THE
CARDS FOLLOWING THE /*SPELL COMMAND. MORE THAN ONE WORD CAN BE PUT ON A
CARD AND THEY ARE TO BE SEPARATED BY A SPACE. ONCE ALL OF THE SPECIAL
WORDS HAVE BEEN ENTERED, THEY SHOULD BE FOLLOWED BY A /*SPELL CARD TO
INFORM SMART THAT THE END OF THE SPECIAL WORDS HAVE BEEN REACHED. IF
YOUR MANUAL DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY SPECIAL WORDS, OR YOU WISH TO SEE WHICH
WORDS YOU NEED TO ADD TO YOUR WORD DATABASE, YOU WILL NEED TO HAVE TWO
..IGNORE
/*SPELL CARDS IN A ROW.
     THERE MAY BE ONE OPERAND TO THE SPELL COMMAND. IT IS THE NUMBER
OF BYTES TO BE USED FOR SPELLING CHECKING. THE DEFAULT VALUE IS 100K.
IF THERE IS NOT ENOUGH STORAGE AVAILABLE, A U0020 ABEND WILL OCCUR.
      AN EXAMPLE OF HOW SMART DENOTES A MISSPELLED WORD IS ON THE NEXT
LINE. THIS WORD IS MISPELLED. AN EXAMPLE OF THE /*SPELL CARDS USED IN
THIS MANUAL IS:
/*IGNORE
/*SPELL
STD S C EEEEE OOOOO CCCCC SEC ND PGSIZE NOSPACE GRANTED X JON
DOE TS TE TF FBA CYL Z C R T AST C O EEE E PGM SFT MV SYSUT
V U SUBSEC N CHARS TN RRRR
/*IGNORE
/*SPELL

OPTIONALLY, SMART CAN PRODUCE A MISSPELLING CROSS REFERENCE AT THE END
OF THE MANUAL. THIS CROSS REFERENCE WILL DISPLAY EACH WORD THAT IS
MISSPELLED AND THE PAGE NUMBER IT OCCURS ON. ONLY ABOUT 200 WORDS CAN
BE RECORDED. IF THERE ARE MORE THAN THAT MISSPELLED, YOU WILL NEED TO
CORRECT THOSE WORDS AND RERUN THE MANUAL TO DISPLAY THE REST OF THE
MISSPELLED WORDS. TO TURN ON THE CROSS REFERENCE, YOU WILL NEED TO USE
THE M PARAMETER. IF THERE ARE NO MISSPELLED WORDS, THIS SECTION WILL NOT
BE PRODUCED.
/*SEC *.* /*SPCHK COMMAND
     THE /*SPCHK COMMAND EITHER TURNS ON OR OFF SPELLING CHECKING.  THIS
COMMAND IS USED TO ELIMINATE CERTAIN PARTS OF A MANUAL FROM SPELLING
CHECKING. THERE MAY BE ONE OPERAND WHICH ARE EITHER "ON" OR "OFF" . THE
OPERAND MUST START IN COLUMN 9 (1 SPACE AFTER THE K IN SPCHK). IF NO
OPERAND IS PRESENT, THEN THE SPELLING CHECKING IS EITHER TURN OFF OR ON
DEPENDING ON THE PRESENT CONDITION OF THE SPELLING CHECKING. THAT IS, IF
SPELLING CHECKING IS ON AND A SPCHK COMMAND IS ENCOUNTERED WITHOUT AN
OPERAND, THEN SPELLING CHECKING IS TURNED OFF. AND LIKEWISE, IF IT IS
OFF, IT IS TURNED ON.
/*SEC *.* /*CENTER COMMAND
     THE /*CENTER COMMAND WILL TAKE THE DATA ON THE REST OF THE CARD
AND CENTER IN ON THE LINE. FOR EXAMPLE, TO PERFORM THE FOLLOWING:
..CENTER THIS IS CENTERED
YOU COULD SPECIFY:
..IGNORE
/*CENTER THIS IS CENTERED
/*SEC * MANUAL STATISTICS
      IF THE JCL PARAMETER CONTAINS AN S, THEN MANUAL STATISTICS WILL
BE DISPLAYED RIGHT AFTER THE INDEX. THE FIRST SECTION IS INDEX
STATISTICS. BELOW IS AN EXPLANATION OF EACH FIELD.
..JUST OFF

  UNUSED STORAGE - THE AMOUNT OF UNUSED STORAGE FOR INDEX DATA.

  WORDS SEARCHED - THE NUMBER OF WORDS IN YOU MANUAL.

  NO OF COMPARES - THE TOTAL NUMBER OF COMPARES NEEDED TO SEE IF THE
                   WORDS ARE IN  THE INDEX.   THE AVERAGE  NUMBER OF
                   COMPARES FOR EACH WORD IS THIS NUMBER  DIVIDED BY
                   WORDS SEARCHED.

  NO INDEX WORDS - THE NUMBER OF WORDS IN YOU INDEX.

   INDEX ENTRIES - THE NUMBER OF TIMES A WORD WAS FOUND IN THE INDEX.

THE NEXT SECTION PERTAINS TO THE SPELLING CHECKING.

    MISSPELLINGS - THE NUMBER OF MISSPELLED WORDS.

  NO SPELL WORDS - THE NUMBER OF WORDS IN THE SPELLING DICTIONARY

   SPELL MAX SRC - THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF COMPARES NEEDED TO DETERMINE
                   WHETHER A WORD WAS MISSPELLED OR NOT.

  SPELL COMPARES - THE TOTAL NUMBER OF  COMPARES NEEDED TO  SEE IF WORDS
                   ARE MISSPELLED.  THE AVERAGE  NUMBER OF  COMPARES FOR
                   EACH WORD IS THIS FIELD DIVIDED BY THE WORDS SEARCHED
                   FIELD.

..JUST
THE LAST SECTION, LETTER OCCURRENCES, TELLS HOW MANY WORDS BEGIN WITH
THE INDICATED LETTER. IF THE LETTER IS PRECEDED BY AN ASTERISK, IS A
LETTER THAT CONTAINS INDEX ENTRIES.

     THE EFFICIENCY OF SMART IS IN PART DETERMINED BY THE NUMBER OF
INDEX AND SPELL COMPARES. THE FEWER THE COMPARES, THE MORE EFFICIENT
SMART IS. THIS EFFICIENCY CAN BE INCREASE BY INCREASING THE STORAGE
ASSIGNED TO EACH FUNCTION.
