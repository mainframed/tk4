PLI3270 INSTALLATION REFERENCE:

      PLI3270 IS A QUICK-AND-DIRTY METHOD OF WRITING
      FULL-SCREEN PLI PROGRAMS RUNNING UNDER TSO.

      METHOD OF OPERATION IS:

         A. INVOKE THE PLI3270 CLIST UNDER TSO.

            1. DESIGN SCREENS

               IT WILL PRESENT UP TO 8 BLANK SCREENS
               UPON WHICH YOU MAY DESIGN YOUR FORMATTED
               DISPLAY.

               SPECIAL CHARACTERS ENTERED ON THE SCREEN
               DESIGNATE VARIOUS FIELD ATTRIBUTE CHARAC-
               TERS. THEY ARE EXPLAINED IN THE CLIST AND
               MAY BE CHANGED BEFORE EXECUTION.

            2. GENERATE SCREENS

               WHEN SATISFIED WITH THE DESIGN OF THE
               SCREENS, THEY ARE GENERATED INTO PLI
               DECLARE STRUCTURES WHICH MAY BE IN-
               CLUDE IN YOUR APPLICATION PROGRAM.

            3. TEST SCREENS

               THE GENERATED DCLS ARE COMPILED AND
               PRESENTED TO THE SCREEN FOR VERIFICATION
               OF FIELD ATTRIBUTES WHILE STILL IN THE
               CLIST.

         B. WRITE THE PLI PROGRAM TO USE THE SCREENS.

               THE PLI PROGRAM IS THEN WRITTEN AND THE
               GENERATED DCL STRUCTURES ARE INCLUDED
               INTO IT.

               TO PRESENT A SCREEN TO A 3270 TERMINAL, THE
               SUBROUTINE WJFS IS CALLED. A FULL SCREEN
               FORMAT IS PRESENTED, AND ANY MODIFICATIONS
               ARE MAPPED BACK INTO THE DCL STRUCTURE.

               ONE CALL TO WJFS ISSUES A FULL-SCREEN TPUT
               AND A TGET ASIS.

         C. CAUTIONS -

               PLI3270 IS DESIGNED ONLY TO MAKE IT VERY
               QUICK TO CREATE FULL-SCREEN TSO PLI PROG-
               RAMS. EFFICIENCY IS NOT A MAJOR CONSIDERA-
               TION.

               ALL FIELDS SENT TO THE SCREEN ARE "DETECTED"
               TO SIMPLIFY THE MAPPING OF RETURNED DATA.
               WHILE THIS DOESN'T HURT MUCH ON LOCALS, IT
               IS A DEFINATE DOG ON REMOTE 3270S.

               GENERATED DATA STREAMS CAN SOMETIMES BE QUITE
               LARGE, 4-5K AND UP. MAXIMUM VTAM, TCAM AND NCP
               BUFFER SIZE MAY HAVE TO BE INCREASED. IF YOU
               GET A TPUT ERROR OR GET LOGGED OFF, IT IS
               PROBABLY THIS.



INSTALLATION:


      THIS SYSTEM IS ON THREE FILES

      FILES    ARE:

            FILE 289 THIS FILE IS IN IEBUPDTE SYSIN FORMAT
                     AND CONTAINS JCL, SOURCE, DOCUMENTATION,
                     MACROS AND BLANK SCREENS
            FILE 290 THIS FILE CONTAINS THE CLIST TO RUN THIS
                     SYSTEM AND INPUT TO A SCRIPT FORMATTER.
                     THIS FILE IS IN IEBCOPY FORMAT
            FILE 291 THIS FILE CONTAINS OUTPUT FROM A SCRIPT
                     PROGRAM. THIS FILE IS IN IEBCOPY FORMAT


      TO USE PLI3270,YOU NEED TO:

            1. INSTALL IN THE LINKLIST THE TSO COMMANDS:

                  UVPD (ALIAS PDS) (YOU MAY WISH TO USE THE LATER
                                    VERSION OF THE PDS COMMAND ON
                                    THIS MODS TAPE)
                  WJCL (ALIAS CLEAR)



            2. INSTALL IN DATASET SYS2.PGMLIB:

                  UUSD     (SCREEN DESIGN PROGRAM)
                  UUSG     (SCREEN GENERATE PROGRAM)
                  UUSGSHRT (SCREEN GENERATE PGM - SHORT FORM)
                  WJFS     (FULLSCREEN TGET-TPUT SUBROUTINE)



            3. INSTALL IN CMDPROC THE CLIST "PLI3270"

                   PLI3270 IS IN FILE 289 WITH A NAME OF PLICLIST;
                   MEMBER PLICLIST SHOULD BE RENAMED TO PLI3270 WHEN
                   IT IS COPIED TO CMDPROC.

            4. COPY MEMBERS SCREEN1 TO SCREEN8 OF THIS PDS TO
                              SYS2.SCREENS.DATA(SCREEN1-8) NONUM

      THE CLIST MAY BE TAILORED IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS:

            1. REMOVE "CLEAR" COMMANDS IF YOU DO NOT INSTALL
               WJCL (ALIAS CLEAR). THIS WILL DECREASE USEABLITY
               OF THE CLIST.

            2. CHANGE USE OF THE PDS COMMAND FOR MEMBER RENAMES
               TO USE OF THE TSO RENAME COMMAND. THIS WILL SLOW
               DOWN ENTRY INTO THE CLIST CONSIDERABLY BUT MAY BE
               DONE IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO INSTALL "PDS"

            3. CHANGE THE CALL COMMANDS FROM 'SYS2.PGMLIB' TO
               YOUR INSTALLATION STANDARD NAME.

            4. CHANGE THE SYS2.SCREENS.DATA DATASET NAME
               TO MATCH YOUR INSTALLATION STANDARDS. THIS
               DATASET CONTAINS BLANK "MODEL" SCREEN IMAGES.





DOCUMENTATION:

      DOCUMENTATION IS CONTAINED IN TWO DATASETS:

            FILE 290

                  CONTAINS SCRIPT INPUT STATEMENTS. THE
                  SCRIPT USED IS THE MIT VERSION. IT WILL
                  NEED CHANGING IF USED WITH WATERLOO OR
                  IBM SCRIPT.

            FILE 291

                  CONTAINS SCRIPT OUTPUT LISTINGS. IT
                  ASSUMES PRINTING ON A 3800 AT 12 PITCH,
                  8 LPI, AND 11 * 8.5 " PAPER.

            MEMBERS ARE:

                  PLI3270 - INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF THE
                            PLI3270 CLIST.

                  WJFS    - INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE OF THE
                            WJFS FULL-SCREEN TGET-TPUT
                            SUBROUTINE.

GOOD LUCK.
