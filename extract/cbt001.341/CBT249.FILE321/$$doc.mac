  THIS IS DOCUMENTATION FOR DYNAMIC BLDL AS UPDATED AND INSTALLED
AT PENN MUTUAL.  THE PROGRAMS WERE UPDATED FOR PUT 8107 LEVEL.
OTHER MODIFICATIONS WERE MADE TO INCREASE RELIABILITY AND MAKE THE
REPORTING A LITTLE NICER.
  THE CODE IS BUILT TO WORK WITH PLAIN VANILLA MVS, AND MAY NEED
MODIFICATION FOR SE OR SP.  THE BLDL NUCLEUS MODULE REPLACES SOME
NUCLEUS CODE AT EXECUTION TIME, AND RELIES ON REGISTER OFFSETS BEING
CORRECT.  THE MODULE DOES A LIMITED SET OF VER EQUIVALENTS, AND WILL
NOT START IF THESE VERS FAIL.  IN THIS CASE, YOU HAVE YOUR NORMAL
BLDL INTACT, AND THIS CODE SIMPLY TAKES UP SPACE AND DOES NOTHING.
  THE SERIALIZATION IS ADEQUATE FOR A UP SYSTEM.  IF YOU'RE RUNNING
AP OR MP, YOU PROBABLY SHOULD IMPROVE THE SERIALIZATION, ALTHOUGH
YOU'LL PROBABLY ALSO GET AWAY WITH THE CODE AS-IS UNDER MOST
CIRCUMSTANCES.
  THE START/STOP MODULE MUST BE LINKED AS AC=1, AND IN AN AUTHORIZED
LIBRARY, AS IT MODIFIES THE MODULE IN THE NUC.
  CHECK THE LISTINGS FOR MORE DETAILS.
  OVER THE COURSE OF THE DAY, WE HAVE FOUND A 96 PERCENT HIT RATE
FOR MODULES IN THE TABLE.  USE THE TABLE LISTING TO MOVE HEAVILY
USED MODULES (MORE THAN A FEW TIMES A MINUTE) TO LPA, IF THEY'RE
REENTRANT.
  THERE IS NOW A COMMERCIAL VERSION OF THIS MOD AVAILABLE (CALLED
PMO).  SAVE $4000 PLUS $2000 PER ADDITIONAL CPU BY INSTALLING THIS
INSTEAD.
