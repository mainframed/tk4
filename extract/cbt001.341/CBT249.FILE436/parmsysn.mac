PARMSYSN is a program to create a control card from the execution parm
and place the card into the SYSIN file.  This allows control cards to
be generated in a PROC.
.pp
To execute PARMSYSN the following JCL is required:
.sp
.in +10
//STEP EXEC PGM=PARMSYSN,
//  PARM='control card'
//SYSIN  DD DSN=&&CC,DISP=(,PASS),SPACE=(TRK,1)
.in -10
.sp
.pp
Then the SYSIN dataset must then be referenced by the desired step.
