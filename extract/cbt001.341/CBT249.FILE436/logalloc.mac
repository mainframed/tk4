The LOGALLOC command is designed to mark all or selected files as
permanently allocated after LOGON.
This means that FREEALL will not free them, but these files can still be
explicitly freed via the FREE F(FILE-NAME) command.

Note that this command is an authorized command and must be executed
via the @C TSO command.
