.sp 2
         Designed to process a 'symbolic' PDS.

         Restricted to LRECL = 80 , any block size of up to 32720.

.subsection 'Options'
.sp 2
               the facilities of this program are invoked through the
               parm field of the EXEC statement.

               The default parms are : LIST,INDEX,SPACE.

               Note that if the default is not taken (any parm
               specified), then all defaults are deleted and the
               user must specify the options he requires.

.subsection 'PARMs'
.sp 2
               LIST - provides a listing on SYSPRINT of the PDS in
                   member name sequence.

               SPACE - provides 3 spaces between members.

               EJECT - ejects to new page after each member.

               INDEX - provides member/page # cross reference.

               NONUM - suppresses printing of line numbers for
                       the list option.

               PUNCH - produces sequential output on SYSPUNCH DD card
                   of input dataset preceded by IEBUPDTE add card.

               NOADD - same output as punch, except no add or
                   number cards.

               REPL - provides a repl card for IEBUPDTE instead of an
                   add card.

               QUAL - allows selection of members to be processed.
                   Uses SYSIN DD card with member name or group name
                   beginning in card column 16. Multiple selections
                   must be in alpha sequence.

               If the number of lines per page must be changed, the
               following local constant should be changed.

               exclusive.

           Invalid combinations:

                             EJECT,SPACE
                             PUNCH,NONUM
                             NOADD,REPL
