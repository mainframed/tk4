.subsection 'Introduction'

    IEHMAP  is  a  program  that gives a formatted listing of a VTOC, a
 dataset or a catalog in a format that is more easily handled than that
 produced  by  the  iehlist  system  utility.  IEHMAP  also has special
 features  that  have been incorporated as they were requested. Some of
 these features are the ability to restore missing TRACKS to a VTOC, to
 completely  re-write  the  VTOC's  format  5  chain, and to give SPACE
 utilization reports by index level.

    IEHMAP  runs  as a problem program under VS and requires no special
 changes  to  be  made to VS. It consists of two reentrant load modules
 which   must  have  an  authorization  code  (linkage  editor  setcode
 operation) of one (1).

    IEHMAP  may  be  invoked  in  the  standard way, passing parameters
 and/or alternate ddname's. See the Utilities SRL.


.subsection 'JCL to execute IEHMAP'

 JCL required to execute IEHMAP is standard system utility JCL:

   //STEPNAME EXEC PGM=IEHMAP<,REGION=XXXXXK>
   // <,PARM='LINES=/L=NNN,MIN=MMM,MAX=VVV,TSO'>
   //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=C<,DCB=BLKSIZE=BBBBB>
   //DDNAME1 DD VOL=SER=VOLID1,DISP=SHR,UNIT=UNITTYPE
   //DDNAME2 DD VOL=SER=VOLID2,DISP=SHR,UNIT=UNITTYPE
      .
      .
      .
   //DDNAMEN DD VOL=SER=VOLIDN,DISP=SHR,UNIT=UNITTYPE
   //SYSIN DD *<,DCB=BLKSIZE=SSSSS>

      Where:

           NNN  (line  count) is any number from 10 thru 999. This will
                be  used  to  set  the line count per page. The default
                line count is 56.

                Note:

                      If  an  invalid  line  count  is passed to IEHMAP
                           (less  than  10  or  greater  than 999), the
                           default  line  count  (56)  will be used. An
                           error message will be issued; it will appear
                           in the user's JCL.

                      For  instalations with unusual paper sizes, etc.,
                           This   may   be  permanently  overridden  by
                           superzapping   the  constant  'linesize'  in
                           csect IEHMAPIN in load module IEHMAPIN.

           TSO  this notifies IEHMAP that it is running under TSO, and,
                therefore,  it  is  not  authorized. When running under
                TSO,  it cannot ENQ upon the VTOC or catalog; also, the
                FIXUP and SORT control cards cannot be specified.

           MMM  (min=  parameter) is the minimum value (in k-bytes) for
                the  variable  conditional  getmain's  IEHMAP  does  to
                obtain  the area for control blocks, reading in DSCB's,
                etc.  This  will  be  rounded  to  the  next higher 4-K
                boundary. The default is 64 (16 4-K pages).

                Note:

                      This    can    be   overridden   permanently   by
                           superzapping   the  constant  'minvalue'  in
                           csect IEHMAPIN in load module IEHMAPIN.

           VVV  (max=  parameter) is the maximum value (in k-bytes) for
                the  variable  conditional  getmain's  IEHMAP  does  to
                obtain  the area for control blocks, reading in DSCB's,
                etc.  This  will  be  rounded  to  the  next higher j-K
                boundary.  The  value  must  be at least 1 (one) higher
                than  the value of the min= parameter (or its default);
                if  it  is  not,  it  will be set to MMM+4. The default
                value is 128 (32 4-K pages).

                Note:

                      This    can    be   permanently   overridden   by
                           superzapping   the  constant  'maxvalue'  in
                           csect IEHMAPIN in load module IEHMAPIN.

           C  (sysout  class) is any alpha character from A to Z or any
                numeric character from 0 thru 9.

                Note:

                      For proper output, IEHMAP requires a 132 position
                           printer with a QN or equivalent train/chain;
                           this  is required as IEHMAP uses the special
                           symbols <, >, ?, and _.

           BBBBB  (blksize  for  SYSPRINT) is any multiple of 137 up to
                and  including  full-track  blocking; LRECL is 137. The
                default blocksize is 3509. The record format is VBA.

           SSSSS  (blksize  for  SYSIN) is any multiple of 80 up to and
                including full-track blocking; LRECL is 80. The default
                blocking factor is 1; ie, blksize=80.


.subsection 'Core Requirements'

   XXXXX  (region  size)  at  the end of the output for a control card,
        IEHMAP  prints  four  unnumbered  messages giving statistics on
        core utilization, broken down by subpool number.

           1.  The  second  line  gives  core allocated in K-bytes, the
                third line gives core used in decimal bytes.

                A.  Region  size  -  this  is  the  size  of the region
                     (address  SPACE)  IEHMAP  is running in (under VS2
                     release  2  or above, this will be the size of the
                     private area).

                B.  Program  size  -  this is the total of subpools 252
                     (reentrant)  and  251 (non-reentrant); it does not
                     include any modules in the VS link pack area.

                C.  Supbool  0 - this is the size of all areas obtained
                     by  IEHMAP  and  the  system for I/o buffers, etc.
                     This should be approximately two times the size of
                     (sssss + bbbbb) rounded to a 4-K boundary.

                D. Subpool 1 - this is the size of the area obtained by
                     IEHMAP  for  saveareas  for  intra csect and inter
                     csect linkages.

                E.  Subpool  2  - this is the size of the area obtained
                     via  variable  conditional  getmain's  for control
                     blocks, read in areas for DSCB's, etc. The minimum
                     and  maximum values are controlled by the min= and
                     max=  parameters.  Once obtained, this area is not
                     freed until all control cards have been processed;
                     ie,  the  size  may  go up with subsequent control
                     cards,  but  it will never go down. Therefore, the
                     amount   used   in   subpool   2  may  be  greatly
                     disproportionate to the size of subpool 2.

                F.  Subpool  3  - this is the size of IEHMAP's workarea
                     (containing  scratch  areas, chain headers, DCB's,
                     etc.)

                G. Min= and max= - these are the values of the min= and
                     max=  variables  for  obtaining subpool 2 core. If
                     not overridden via the parm field, the will be set
                     at min=64k and max=128k.

                H.  Region used - this is the total of all used core in
                     the above subpools.

           2.  The  fourth  line  gives the approximate, minimum region
                required  for  the current control card running against
                the current volume. This is a total of the following:

                A. Subpool 0 allocated
                b. Subpool 1 allocated
                c. Subpool 2 used rounded to the min= value
                d. Subpool 3 allocated
                e. Program size

           3.  Since  IEHMAP  does variable conditional getmain's, when
                running  under  VS2  release  2 or above, a region size
                must  be  supplied  on  the job or exec JCL card or the
                size  parameter  when  logging onto TSO, if the default
                region  size  is  not equal to or greater than the size
                given in the minimum region required message.

           4.  For  volumes  with  a  large number of datasets, for TTR
                control  card  output,  for VERIFY control card output,
                and  for SPACE, USERID or DEPT control card output, the
                region  size  may  have  to be increased to as large as
                1000k or more.

.subsection 'DD Card's for IEHMAP'

 SYSPRINT  this  is  the  primary  output  for  IEHMAP; it contains a a
      listing  of  the  control cards, any error messages that may have
      been generated, and the output requested by the control cards.

 SYSPRINT  has  a  record  format  of variable blocked with asa control
      characters  (VBA),  a logical record length of 137, and a default
      blocksize  of  3509.  The  blocksize  may  be  overridden via the
      ddcard.

 SYSIN  this  is  the  control  card  input  to IEHMAP. It contains the
      control  cards  the user has produced to tell IEHMAP what type of
      output he wants.

 SYSIN has a record format of fixed blocked, a logical record length of
      80,  and  a  default  blocksize  of  80.  The  blocksize  may  be
      overridden via the ddcard.

 ddname1  thru ddnamen these ddcard's (which can have any ddname except
      the   following  -  SYSIN,  SYSPRINT,  JOBLIB,  STEPLIB,  JOBCAT,
      STEPCAT,  SYSABEND,  SYSUDUMP,  and PGM=*.DD) supply a volume for
      IEHMAP  to work with. If a VTOC listing is requested, IEHMAP will
      internally  change  the  JFCB to point to the volume's VTOC, if a
      catalog listing, to the catalog, if a dataset, to the dataset.


.subsection 'Control Cards'

 Control cards for IEHMAP are free form with the following format:

           <NAME> operation operand1<,operand2><,OPT=(options)>

         NAME  is  optional,  but  if  omitted,  at  least one blank is
              required.  The  length of the NAME field need not be less
              than or equal eight characters as it is ignored.

         Operand1 and/or operand2 can be one of the following:

                DSNAME
                VOL=volid
                CNAME=alt-catalog-NAME
                QUAL=qualifier-NAME

           DSNAME  this  is  the  fully qualified NAME of a dataset for
                IEHMAP  to  work  with or, if the operation is CATLG or
                USERID,  it may be an index level. If it is a member of
                a  GDG,  it  can  be supplied in the manner of JCL; ie,
                GDG(-1), GDG(0), etc.

           VOL=  this  is the volume (VOLID) for IEHMAP to work with or
                the volume on which DSNAME or the catalog resides.

           CNAME= this is the dsname to be used on a catlg listing when
                the  catalog's  name is not sysctlg. This would be used
                when a backup copy of the catalog is being kept and you
                wish to list it.

           QUAL=  this  gives  the number of digits that should be used
                for  a  DEPT  operation.  The qualifier-name may be any
                characters  which  add  up  to  the length desired; eg,
                QUAL=ddd would give a 3 digit length.

           OPT=  for certain of the IEHMAP operations, other operations
                may  be  compatible and can be specified as the options
                of  the OPT= field. For certain operations (see below),
                OPT= must be specified.

                Notes:

                      If  VOLID  is  not given and DSNAME is, DSNAME is
                           assumed  to be cataloged and a search of the
                           catalog  will  be  made,  using the "SYSRES"
                           catalog as the start of the catalog search.

                      If  VOLID  is given with DSNAME, that volume will
                           be  used  as  the  location  of  DSNAME,  no
                           catalog search will be made.

                      If  DSNAME  is  given  in  the  JCL form of a GDG
                           member,  it must be cataloged; therefore, if
                           VOLID is given, it will be ignored.

                      If  CNAME= is given, VOL= must also be specified,
                           unless   the  alternate  catalog  is  itself
                           cataloged in the system catalog.

                      If  multiple  options are specified, they must be
                           enclosed  in  parentheses  and  separated by
                           commas; if only one option is specified, the
                           parentheses may be omitted.

                      If  the  operation  is  DEPT  or  SPACE, the VOL=
                           parameter may have multiple VOLID's enclosed
                           in parentheses; eg, VOL=(D06DB0,D89RES).

                      The  QUAL=  operand  may be specified only if the
                           operation is DEPT; in all other cases, it is
                           ignored.

    Continuation  cards  are  FREE  format and can start in any column.
 Continuation  is  indicated by a comma followed by at least one blank.
 Card  column  72  need  not  be punched to indicate continuation. Card
 column one (1) of the continuation card must be blank.

    If a control card is continued, the first control card must contain
 the operation and at least one operand.

    Comments  can appear anywhere on a control card after a comma and a
 blank (on continued cards) or after a blank following the last operand
 on the card.

    Comment  cards  (*  in  column  1) can appear anywhere in the input
 stream.  There  is no limit on the number of comment cards that can be
 in  the input stream, nor on their placement; ie, comment cards may be
 placed between continued cards.


.subsection 'Control Card Output'

      IEHMAP's output can be classified into three general catagories:

           Output for an entire volume
           Output for a specified dataset
           Output for a specified catalog

    The  specific  output  depends  upon  the  operation requested, the
 operands  supplied,  and  any  options  chosen. This will be described
 briefly  after  each  control card. A fuller description of the output
 will be given in an appendix along with some sample output.

    A  summary of each control card and its output follows. This is not
 comprehensive  as  the  OPT=  keyword  may  add  additional  output as
 described under the topics OPT= and other options.


.subsection 'Control Card Operations'

    Currently, the following operations are implemented:

                      ATTRIB
                      AVAIL
                      CATLG
                      CCHHR
                      DEPT
                      DIR
                      DSNAME
                      DUMP
                      DUMP456
                      FIXUP
                      FREE
                      MAP
                      MISSING
                      NAME
                      OPT
                      OVERLAP
                      PASS
                      PDS
                      SEND
                      SORT
                      SPACE
                      TRACKS
                      TTR
                      USERID
                      VERIFY


.subsection 'Control Card Format'

.subsub 'NAME Control Card'

      <NAME> NAME VOL=volid

      This will give:

           A. Information taken from the formats 4, 5, and 6, giving:

                A description of the device type for VOLID
                a description of the VTOC of VOLID
                a summary of available SPACE on the volume
                a summary of split cylinder datasets (if applicable)

           B. An alphabetical listing of each dataset on VOLID, giving:

                Creation date as dd/mm/yy
                expiration date as dd/mm/yy
                VOLID created on
                dataset sequence number

                            Or (see OPT=)

                Creation date as dd/mm/yy
                reference date as dd/mm/yy
                change date as dd/mm/yy

                Dsorg, recfm, blksize, lrecl, keylen, optcd
                TRACKS allocated
                TRACKS actually used
                number of extents
                secondary allocation
                allocation type

                Notes:

                      As IEHMAP validity checks creation and expiration
                      dates  (or creation, reference, and change dates)
                      in  the  DSCB's,  an  invalid  date  will  not be
                      translated  to  dd/mm/yy  but will be left in the
                      form yy.Ddd. This will usually appear on datasets
                      with  no  expiration date (00.000) Or the highest
                      possible expiration date (99.366).

                      Dsorg  (dataset  organization) is given as one of
                      the following:

                          PS physical sequential
                          PO partitioned organization
                          IS indexed sequential
                          DA direct organization
                          VS virtual sequential
                          ? unknown

                      Recfm  (record  format)  is given in standard DCB
                      format:

                          F fixed
                          V variable
                          U uundefined
                          B blocked
                          S standard (with F)
                          S spanned (with V)
                          A asa control characters
                          M machine control characters

                      An X in the RECFM indicates that both the asa and
                      machine bits were one.

                      A ? indicates that no bits were set.

                      BLKSIZE, LRECL, and KEYLEN are given in decimal.

                      OPTCD (option codes) is given in hexidecimal.

                      Allocation type is given in two columns:

                          Column 1 is the type of allocation:

                               C cylinder
                               T TRACKS
                               A absolute
                               S split cylinder

                          Column 2 is the options specified:

                               C contig
                               A alx
                               M mxig
                               R round

                          If  no option was specified, column 2 will be
                          blank.

           C.  The  number of datasets on the volume and the space they
           occupy.

                This  is  a  count  of the number of datasets (format 1
                DSCB's)  IEHMAP found on the volume. The space occupied
                is  the sum of the space allocated to all datasets plus
                that allocated to "unaccounted space" (VTOC, etc.)

           D. A count of the DSCB's in the VTOC

                This  is  a  count  of  the DSCB's IEHMAP read from the
                VTOC.  A  count  of  each  type of DSCB is given plus a
                total of all DSCB's.

                See message MAP059I

           E. Errors found in DSCB's counts

                Any  errors  found in the count of DSCB's actually read
                into  core  versus  the  information  obtained from the
                format 4, and the formats 1, 5, 6, and 4 chains.

                See message MAP060I

           F.  The  number  of different types of dataset organizations
           found.

                This is a totaling of the various dataset organizations
                found in the VTOC.

                See message MAP068I

           G. The number of datasets by extents.

                This is a totaling of the datasets found in the VTOC by
                the number of extents they occupy.

                See message MAP069I

           H. The allocation of datasets by TRACKS.

                This is a totaling of the datasets found in the VTOC by
                the number of TRACKS they occupy.

                See message MAP070I

           I. The number of contiguous available cylinders.

                This is a totaling of available SPACE found in the VTOC
                by the number of contiguous cylinders it occupies.

                See message MAP071I

           J. The number of contiguous available TRACKS.

                This is a totaling of available SPACE found in the VTOC
                by the number of contiguous TRACKS it occupies.

                See message MAP072I

   2. <NAME> NAME VOL=volid,OPT=noprint

      This  will give the same information as NAME 1.A., 1.C. Thru 1.J;
      ie, it will not list the dataset information. This is provided to
      give a quick summary of the VTOC.

.subsub 'TRACKS Control Card'

   1. <NAME> TRACKS VOL=volid

      This will give:

           A. The allocation of each track on the volume in CCHHR order

                The starting CCHH
                the ending CCHH
                the NAME of the dataset it is assigned to
                an indication that it is FREE SPACE
                an indication that it is assigned to
                     "unaccounted SPACE" (VTOC, etc.)
                The extent number (if assigned to a dataset)
                the number of TRACKS in the extent

           B. A listing of any errors found in track allocation

                Overlapping TRACKS
                MISSING TRACKS
                invalid extents

                Note:

                      If  MISSING  TRACKS  are  found,  in place of the
                      starting  and  ending CCHH's a hexidecimal number
                      will appear; this is the value that would have to
                      be  placed in a format 5 to recover this SPACE as
                      available SPACE.


           C. A totalling of all TRACKS found

           D. A totalling of all TRACKS MISSING (if applicable)

   2. <NAME> TRACKS VOL=volid,OPT=noprint

      This will give the same information as TRACKS 1.B. Thru 1.D.; Ie,
      it will not print the allocation of each track on the volume.

.subsub 'MAP Control Card'

   1. <NAME> MAP VOL=volid

      This will give a combination of the output of NAME and TRACKS for
      VOLID. This would be the normal control card for IEHMAP.

      NAME and TRACKS would normally be used only if the message:

           MAP032W *** no more core, aborted ***

      Appears,  and a larger region could not be obtained to run IEHMAP
      in.

   2. <NAME> MAP VOL=volid,OPT=noprint

      This  will  give the same information as under NAME 2. And TRACKS
      2.

.subsub 'DUMP Control Card'

   1. <NAME> DUMP VOL=volid

      This  will  give the same information as MAP VOL=volid plus a hex
      DUMP  of  each  DSCB  in  the  format 4, 5, and 6 chains, and the
      format 1 chain.

   2. <NAME> DUMP DSNAME

      This  will give the same information about DSNAME that NAME would
      give, plus a DUMP of the DSCB's associated with DSNAME.


.subsub 'DUMP456 Control Card'

   1. <NAME> DUMP456 VOL=volid

      This  will  give  the  information  about  the  VTOC  that a NAME
      VOL=volid  control card would give, plus a hex DUMP of the format
      4, 5, and 6 chains.

   2. <NAME> DUMP456 DSNAME

      This will give the same information as a DUMP DSNAME control card
      would  give;  ie,  it will not investigate the format 4, 5, and 6
      chains but the format 1 chain.

.subsub 'CCHHR Control Card'

   1. <NAME> CCHHR VOL=volid

      This  will  give the same information as a DUMP VOL=volid control
      card  would  give;  however,  the  DSCB's will be dumped in CCHHR
      order;  that is, they will be dumped in the order they are in the
      VTOC,  not  alphabetically  by  dataset  NAME.  Also, the various
      chains of DSCB's (the format 1 chain, the format 5 chain, and the
      format  6  chain)  will  not  be  dumped  in chain order. This is
      similar to the DUMP option of iehlist.

   2. <NAME> CCHHR DSNAME

      This  will give the same information as a CCHHR VOL=volid control
      card  would  for  the volume on which DSNAME resides; ie, it will
      not  DUMP  only the DSCB's associated with DSNAME - this would be
      accomplished by using the DUMP DSNAME control card.

.subsub 'DSNAME Control Card'

   1. <NAME> DSNAME DSNAME

      This  will  give  the same information as a NAME control card for
      DSNAME only.


.subsub 'PDS Control Card'

   1. <NAME> PDS DSNAME

      This  will give the same information as a DSNAME control card for
      DSNAME if it is a partitioned organization (po) dataset.

      It  will also give a listing of the members from the directory in
      alphabetical   order,   along   with  a  DUMP  of  the  directory
      information in hexidecimal, and a summary of the directory SPACE.

           Note:

                 An  'a'  after  a  member NAME indicates that it is an
                 alias.

                 If  DSNAME is not po, there will be no output for this
                 control card. The DSNAME control card would have to be
                 used in this case.

   2. <NAME> PDS VOL=volid

      This will give the PDS control card output for each po dataset on
      VOLID.

.subsub 'TTR Control Card'

   1. <NAME> TTR DSNAME

      This  will give the same information as a PDS control card would;
      however,  the  members  from  the directory will be listed in TTR
      order,   not   alphabetically.   Alias   names   will  be  sorted
      alphabetically after the true member NAME.

   2. <NAME> TTR VOL=volid

      This  will  give  the  TTR  control  card information for each po
      dataset on VOLID.


.subsub 'ATTRIB Control Card'

   1. <NAME> ATTRIB DSNAME

      This  will give the same information as a DSNAME control card for
      DSNAME if it is a partitioned organization (po) dataset.

      It  will also give a listing of the members from the directory in
      alphabetical  order, and if the members are load modules, it will
      format the linkage editor data from the directory as follows:

           The member NAME
           an indication that the member is an alias
           the TTR where the member starts
           the number of user TTR's
           the TTR where the text records start
           the OS/VS linkage editor flags
           the load module size (storage required)
           the load module entry point
           the setssi data (if present)
           the setcode data (if present)
           the true member NAME if an alias
           the true entry point if an alias
           the load modules linkage editor attributes

                Refr refreshable
                rent re-entrant
                reus reuseable
                dc downward compatible
                ol only loadable
                ovly overlay
                ne not editable
                notex not executable

           Notes:

                If  the load module was link edited with the OS linkage
                editor,  the  VS  linkage  editor  flags  will  not  be
                present.

                If  an  alias  member  was  not link edited with the VS
                linkage  editor,  the  true member NAME and entry point
                will  only  appear  if the load module is re-entrant or
                refreshable.

                If  the  module  was  link  edited  with the OS linkage
                editor, the setcode information will not be present.

   2. <NAME> ATTRIB VOL=volid

      This will give the ATTRIB control card output for each po dataset
      on VOLID.


.subsub 'DIR Control Card'

   1. <NAME> DIR DSNAME

      This  will give the same information as a DSNAME control card for
      DSNAME  if  it is a po dataset, plus the summary of the directory
      SPACE that a PDS control card gives.

   2. <NAME> DIR VOL=volid

      This  will  give  the  DIR  control  card information for each po
      dataset on VOLID.

.subsub 'VERIFY Control Card'

   1. <NAME> VERIFY VOL=volid

      This gives the same information as a NAME VOL=volid control card;
      in  addition,  a verification of the format 4, 5, 6, and 1 chains
      is performed.

      By verification is meant the following:

           All  formats  5  are  validated to be chained from the first
           format 5
           all formats 6 are validated to be chained from the format 4
           all formats 2 are validated to be chained from a format 1
           all formats 3 are validated to be chained from a format 1 or
           2

      Any errors, such as dangling (ie, non-chained) formats 2, 3, 5 or
      6 are listed.

      If a second format 4 is found, it will be listed.

      If  the  key of a format 0 DSCB is not 44 hex zeroes, it too will
      be listed.

      If  an  unknown DSCB type (with an id higher than 6) is found, it
      will also be listed.

.subsub 'FREE Control Card'

   1. <NAME> FREE VOL=volid

      This  gives  a  description  of  the  VTOC  and  a summary of the
      available  SPACE. This is a modification of the NAME control card
      card output (qv).


.subsub 'CATLG Control Card'

      Note:

           The  catalog  processing routines of IEHMAP cannot process a
           vsam catalog.

   1. <NAME> CATLG VOL=volid

      This will give:

           A. A summary of the catalog for VOLID giving:

                The number of blocks in the catalog
                the first available TTR in the catalog
                the first extent of the catalog
                the number of extents the catalog occupies
                the number of catalog blocks per track

           B. An alphabetical listing of all catalog entries giving:

                The catalog entry
                the type of entry
                the number of volumes a dataset is cataloged to
                VOLID(s) a dataset is cataloged to
                volume type in hex
                volume description
                volume sequence number

                Note:

                      A  volume description of 'unknown' says that that
                      particular  type  of  device  is  not in IEHMAP's
                      table  of  volume  types.  This usually occurs on
                      datasets  that  are  cataloged via iehprogm using
                      VOL=sysda=volid.   This   can   be  corrected  by
                      superzapping  the  catdev  csect  in  load module
                      IEHMAP.

                      If  an  entry  is  an  alias,  the true NAME will
                      appear to the right of the alias NAME.

           C. Information from a GDG index

                The number of entries to keep
                the flags


           D. A summary of the index blocks found giving:

                The number of GDG indices found
                the number of cvol entries found
                the number of unused indices found
                the number of datasets cataloged
                the number of alias entries found
                the maximum number of indices in a NAME

           E. A useage summary of the catalog blocks

                The number of blocks in the catalog
                the number of unused blocks in the catalog

           F. A summary of I/o operations

                The number of entries to the read routine
                the number of catalog blocks found in core

                These  two  statistics  give  some  indication  of  the
                fragmentation  of  the  catalog  indices. The number of
                entries  to  the  read routine is the number of times a
                chain  of  blocks  was being followed (either foward or
                backwards).  The number of catalog blocks found in core
                is  the number of times a previously read catalog block
                was   requested  (for  efficiency  and  to  lessen  I/o
                operations,  as IEHMAP goes foward down an index chain,
                it keeps the previously read blocks in core).

   2. <NAME> CATLG

      This will be interpreted as requesting the catalog of the current
      "sysres" device.

           Note:

                 A ddcard for "sysres" is required.

   3. <NAME> CATLG DSNAME<,VOL=volid>

      This  will start the catalog listing at DSNAME. The DSNAME may be
      fully  qualified or may be an index level; it may be a GDG member
      and  may  be given in the manner of JCL (ie, of the form GDG(-1),
      etc.)


   4. <NAME> CATLG CNAME=dsname,VOL=volid

      This indicates to IEHMAP that DSNAME is an alternate catalog (ie,
      it does not have a DSNAME of sysctlg), and tells IEHMAP to give a
      CATLG listing of it.

      All  options  valid for CATLG control cards can be specified with
      CNAME=.

   5. <NAME> CATLG VOL=volid,OPT=noprint

      This  gives the information about the catalog on VOLID that CATLG
      1.A, 1.D thru 1.F gives.

      All  options valid for CATLG control cards, including CNAME=, may
      be specified with OPT=noprint.


.subsub 'OVERLAP Control Card'

   1. <NAME> OVERLAP VOL=volid

      This  will  check  the  VTOC of VOLID for overlapping extents and
      list  any  that  are  found. This is a modification of the TRACKS
      control card output (qv).

.subsub 'MISSING Control Card'

   1. <NAME> MISSING VOL=volid

      This  will  check  the VTOC of VOLID for MISSING TRACKS, and list
      any  that are found. This is a modification of the TRACKS control
      card output (qv).

.subsub 'AVAIL Control Card'

   1. <NAME> AVAIL VOL=volid

      This  will list all available SPACE on VOLID in CCHHR order. This
      is a modification of the TRACKS control card output (qv).

.subsub 'SPACE Control Card'

   1. <NAME> SPACE VOL=volid

      This  requests that a listing of all datasets available to IEHMAP
      (via  ddcards  pointing  to  volumes)  be  given  by  first level
      qualifier,  that a check be made for their being cataloged in the
      catalog  on  VOLID,  and  a SPACE accounting be made of the track
      allocation and useage.

      Datasets  which are cataloged but not available to IEHMAP will be
      flagged with the indication:

      Not on volume or volume not mounted

   2. <NAME> SPACE VOL=(volid,volid,...)

      This  tells  IEHMAP  that a SPACE report should be given and that
      multiple  catalogs  are  to  be  used. The catalogs are on VOLID,
      VOLID, ...


.subsub 'USERID Control Card'

   1. <NAME> USERID index,VOL=volid

      This  requests  that a SPACE control card output be given for the
      index level given on the control card. A SPACE accounting for all
      datasets  available  to IEHMAP (via ddcard's) for the index level
      specified  will  be given. The VOLID given in the VOL= operand is
      the location of the catalog for the index given.

.subsub 'DEPT Control Card'

   1. <NAME> DEPT QUAL=qualifier,VOL=volid

      This  requests that a SPACE control card output be given, but the
      output  should  be  segmented  by  departments.  The  size of the
      departmental  id  is  given  by  the  number of characters in the
      qualifier;  ie,  the  count of characters determines where IEHMAP
      should  start  accounting  for  a  new  department.  Eg, QUAL=xxx
      specifies  that  the  departmental  identifiers  are in the first
      three characters of all indices.

   2. <NAME> DEPT QUAL=qualifier,VOL=(volid,volid,...)

      This  requests  that  the  DEPT  control card output be given for
      multiple catalogs. The catalogs are on VOLID, VOLID, ...

.subsub 'FIXUP Control Card'

   1. <NAME> FIXUP VOL=volid

         This tells IEHMAP to make an attempt to recover MISSING TRACKS
      on  VOLID.  This  is  done  by adding MISSING extents to the last
      format 5 in the format 5 chain, and in addition, one extra format
      5  will  be  build  from a format 0. By this means, from 26 to 51
      MISSING extents may be recovered.

         The  output  of FIXUP is the same as two TRACKS control cards.
      The  first  output  shows the MISSING TRACKS that were found, and
      the  action  that  IEHMAP  took  (replaced  or not replaced). The
      second is a normal TRACKS output showing what the VTOC looks like
      after the FIXUP operation.


.subsub 'SORT Control Card'

   1. <NAME> SORT VOL=volid

         This  requests  IEHMAP  to make a more encompassing attempt to
      recover  MISSING  TRACKS than a FIXUP will do. IEHMAP attempts to
      arrange  the MISSING TRACKS in CCHHR order in the format 5 chain,
      then the format 5 chain is rewritten.

         The  output  of  a  SORT  operation  is  the  same as a FIXUP;
      however, all FREE SPACE will be listed as MISSING, and the action
      IEHMAP took will be shown.

         SORT should be used if the second output of a FIXUP shows that
      IEHMAP has created multiple contiguous extents, and/or the volume
      has  more  than  three  formats  5.  By  multiple contiguous FREE
      extents  is  meant  two  or  more  contiguous  extents  marked as
      'available' on the second output of FIXUP.


.subsub 'SEND Control Card'

   1. <NAME> SEND message-to-be-sent-to-system-operator

         This allows the user of IEHMAP to SEND a message to the system
      operator.  This could be used to supply the password for a 'read'
      protected dataset during a PDS operation, etc.

         The message cannot be continued beyond column 71; for messages
      longer  than the allowable length, multiple SEND cards would have
      to be used.

         There  is  no limit to the number of SEND cards that can be in
      the  IEHMAP  input stream nor their placement as they are treated
      as comment cards (see below).

.subsub 'Comment Cards'

         Comments  may be included in the IEHMAP input stream by having
      an  asterisk  (*)  in  column  1.  The comment may be extended to
      column 80 as no check of the card is made.

         There  is  no limit as to the number of comment cards that may
      be included, nor on their positioning.

.subsub 'PASS Option'

   1. <NAME> operation operand1<,operand2>,OPT=PASS

         The  PASS  option may be specified for PDS, TTR, DIR or ATTRIB
      control  cards.  If a dataset is partitioned but is protected for
      'read'  (ie, pwread), IEHMAP will not attempt to give a PDS, TTR,
      DIR,  or  ATTRIB  listing  for  this  dataset unless OPT=PASS was
      specified.  This is done to minimize operator intervention during
      an  IEHMAP  run.  If a dataset is protected only for 'write' (ie,
      pwwrite),  IEHMAP will open it and give the directory information
      requested.

.subsub 'TTR Option'

   1. <NAME> ATTRIB operand1,OPT=TTR

         The  TTR  option,  when  specified on the ATTRIB control card,
      will  give  the  same output as the ATTRIB control card; however,
      the member names will be sorted in TTR order not alphabetical.


.subsub 'Other Options'

   1. <NAME> operation operand1<,operand2>,OPT=DUMP

         The  DUMP  option  may be specified on most control cards. The
      control  cards  on  which  it  is  most useful are PDS, TTR, DIR,
      ATTRIB, and CATLG.

         On  the  po dataset operations, the DSCB's associated with the
      dataset will be dumped, in hex, after the requested output.

         On  the CATLG operation, each catalog block will be dumped, in
      hex,  as  it  is read; ie, the catalog entry following the dumped
      catalog  block  may  not  belong  to that block but may have been
      built  from  up  to  22  previous  blocks  (the maximum number of
      indices in a cataloged dataset NAME).

         The  equivalent of OPT=DUMP for a MAP control card is the DUMP
      control  card,  but  OPT=DUMP  may  be specified on a MAP control
      card.

   2. <NAME> operation operand1<,operand2>,OPT=aqueue

         This  says  that  the  open, close, and eov routines have been
      modified to set a reference and change date in the format 1 DSCB.
      This  requests  that  the creation, reference and change dates be
      formatted in place of the volume created on, the dataset sequence
      number, and the expiration date.

   3. <NAME > operation operand1<,operand2>,OPT=noprint

         The noprint option may be specified on most control cards. The
      control cards on which it is most useful are MAP and CATLG.

         When  noprint  is  specified,  no  dataset information will be
      given; only the summaries will be outputted. Therefore, it is not
      advisable to us OPT=noprint on PDS, ATTRIB, etc. Control cards.



.subsection 'Messages'


   All IEHMAP messages are of the following format:

           Msgid-msgnumber-severity message

                     Msgid is always MAP
                     msgnumber is the number in IEHMAP's table
                     severity is a one character code

                          I Informational....RC=0

                          C Catastrophic.....RC=16

           Notes:

                     I  informational - this is a message to inform the
                     user of some event, data, total, etc.

                     W  warning  - this is a message to inform the user
                     of  some  unusual  occurance  which may or may not
                     have  some  effect  on  IEHMAP's processing of the
                     current control card.

                     E  error - this is a message to inform the user of

                     user  of  a  condition  that  IEHMAP recognizes as
                     being  disasterous  to  its  processing,  such  as
                     possible loops, etc. This will be accompanied by a
                     user abend.



.subsub 'Messages in SYSPRINT'


   MAP000I input card from SYSIN

      This  is  an  echo of the control card from SYSIN in the SYSPRINT
      file.

   MAP001I TSO specified, operation cancelled

      The  TSO  parameter  was  specifeid in the parm field; therefore,
      neither the SORT nor the FIXUP operations can be specified.

   MAP002T no SYSIN dd card

      This  appears in the SYSPRINT output when the SYSIN ddcard or its
      alternate did not open.

   MAP003W "oooooooo" unknown operation/operand

      This  appears  when an invalid operation was requrested; oooooooo
      is the invalid operation.

   MAP004E f1 does not -> at f2 or f3

      This appears when a format 1 indicates that there is another DSCB
      chained  from  it,  but  that  DSCB is not a format 2 or 3. It is
      accompanied by a DUMP of the format 1 and the DSCB it pointed to.

   MAP005E f2 does not -> at f3

      This  appears  when  a  format  2  indicates  there is a format 3
      chained  from  it,  but  the  DSCB  was  not  a  format  3. It is
      accompanied by a DUMP of the format 2 and the DSCB it pointed to.

   MAP006E f4 does not -> at f6

      This  appears  when  the  format  4 indicates there is a format 6
      chain,  but  the  DSCB  pointed  to  was  not  a  format 6. It is
      accompanied by a DUMP of the format 4 and the DSCB it pointed to.


   MAP007I ddddd total TRACKS MISSING

      This appears at the end of the track MAP listing when one or more
      TRACKS are MISSING.

   MAP008I ddddd TRACKS accounted for

      This  appears  at the end of the track MAP listing indicating how
      many  TRACKS were accounted for. Depending upon overlaps, invalid
      extents,  and  MISSING  TRACKS,  this  may  be  accurate  or not;
      however,  this  is the total that dadsm will regard as the number
      of TRACKS, both FREE and used, that this volume contains.

   MAP009E cannot find ddcard for volume

      This  appears  when  a  search of the tiot did not find a useable
      ddcard  that would allocate the required volume to IEHMAP. IEHMAP
      will not use ddcards with the following names:

                SYSIN
                SYSPRINT
                JOBLIB
                STEPLIB
                JOBCAT
                STEPCAT
                SYSABEND
                SYSUDUMP
                PGM=*.DD

      Also, IEHMAP will not use ddcards that are concatenated.

   MAP010E device not direct access

      This  appears  when  the  VOLID obtained, either thru a VOL=volid
      parameter  or  a  search  of the catalog, was not a direct access
      device type. Only direct access devices are supported by IEHMAP.

   MAP011E unknown device type

      This  appears  whenever  the  VOLID  obtained,  either  thru  the
      VOL=volid parameter or a catalog search, is on a device type that
      IEHMAP  does  not  support. IEHMAP supports the following devices
      only:

           2301,  2302, 2303, 2305-1, 2305-2, 2311, 2314, 3330, 3330-1,
           And 3340

           IEHMAP does not support 2321's.


   MAP012E attempt to open VTOC failed

      This  appears  when  the dcboflgs bit in the DCB for the VTOC was
      not  set  by  open.  This should never occur as IEHMAP has done a
      tiot  search  for  the ddcard allocating the volume to itself. If
      this does occur, it is probably an error in open.

   MAP013E first DSCB not f4

      This  appears  when  the  first  DSCB read from the VTOC is not a
      format 4. This indicates the volume is not useable by VS.

   MAP014E bad DSCB; should have been f5

      This  appears  when  the  second DSCB read form the VTOC is not a
      format  5. This indicates that the volume is not useable by VS. A
      DUMP of the bad DSCB accompanies the message.

   MAP015I contains mmmm members, aaaa aliases, and uses uuuu
           of the dddd directory blocks allocated.

      This  is  the  summary  of the directory of a po dataset. This is
      only put out for a PDS, ATTRIB, TTR or DIR control card.

           Mmmm is the number of members
           aaaa is the number of aliases
           uuuu is the number of used blocks
           dddd is the number of allocated blocks

   MAP016E card in error

      This  appears  when  the card listed in the MAP000I message above
      this message has a syntax error.

   MAP017E cvol not mounted

      This  appears when a cvol was not mounted for a locate operation.
      (Locate return code 4)

   MAP018E dataset not cataloged

      This  appears  when  a  catalog search could not find the dataset
      NAME. (Locate return code 8)


   MAP019E index found at dataset level

      This  appears  when an index level was given instead of a dataset
      NAME;  ie,  the dataset NAME needs further qualification. (Locate
      return code 12)

   MAP020E dataset found at index level

      This  appears when a dataset NAME is too fully qualified; ie, the
      DSNAME is really shorter than given. (Locate return code 16)

   MAP021E syntax error in dataset NAME

      This  appears  when  some  syntax  error  was found by the locate
      routines  in  the DSNAME. This could be a 9 character index, etc.
      IEHMAP  does  not  validity  check dataset names passed to it via
      control  cards  other  than  for  those  on a CATLG control card.
      (Locate return code 20)

   MAP022E permanent I/o error in catalog

      This  appears  when  the locate routines diagnose an I/o error in
      the catalog. (Locate return code 24)

   MAP023E relative TTR not in catalog

      This appears when a TTR obtained from some previous catalog block
      points outside the catalog extents. (Locate return code 28)

   MAP024E volume not mounted

      This  appears  when  an  obtain  of  a  DSCB, via the obtain svc,
      failed. (Obtain return code 4)

   MAP025E dataset not found on volume

      This  appears  when  obtain could not find the DSCB for DSNAME on
      the volume found thru the catalog or via the VOL=volid parameter.
      (Obtain return code 8)


   MAP026E permanent I/o error in VTOC

      This  appears  when  the obtain routines diagnose an I/o error in
      the VTOC. (Obtain return code 12)

   MAP027E invalid workarea ->

      This appears when the obtain routines determine that the workarea
      pointer  passed  by IEHMAP is not valid. As IEHMAP does a getmain
      for  its  workarea,  the occurance of this message is an error in
      getmain. (Obtain return code 16)

   MAP028E CCHHR not in VTOC

      This  appears when a DSCB has a pointer to a chained DSCB and the
      pointer  was  to  an  address outside of the VTOC. (Obtain return
      code 20)

   MAP029E eof reading f4

      This  appears  when an end of file condition was encountered when
      reading  the  first  DSCB from the VTOC. This means the volume is
      not useable by VS.

   MAP030E eof reading 1st f5

      This  appears  when an end of file condition was encountered when
      the  second  DSCB  of  the VTOC was being read, this is the first
      format  5  in the VTOC. This means that the volume is not useable
      by VS.

   MAP031E f6 does not -> at f6

      This  appears  when  a  format  6 indicates that there is another
      format  6  chained  from  it,  but  the DSCB pointed to was not a
      format  6.  This is accompanied by a DUMP of the format 6 and the
      DSCB that it was pointing to.


   MAP032W *** no more core, aborted ***

      This  appears  when  IEHMAP  could  not get enough core to do the
      requested  operation  in.  IEHMAP  will  attempt  to give as much
      useful  information  as it can from what it has been able to read
      into core with the core available.

   MAP033E f3 does not -> at f3

      This  appears  when  a  format  3 indicates that there is another
      format  3 chained from it, but that DSCB was not a format 3. This
      is  accompanied  by  a DUMP of the format 3 and the DSCB that was
      chained from it.

      This  will  probably  never  appear,  as  at present, VS does not
      support more than one format 3 to a dataset.

   MAP034E error re-writing f5

      This  appears when IEHMAP had an I/o error attempting to re-write
      the format 5 chain during a FIXUP or SORT operation.

   MAP035W permanent I/O error in directory

      This appears when an I/o error occured while IEHMAP was reading a
      po  dataset's  directory.  This probably means that the directory
      has been overwritten.

   MAP036I dddd TRACKS replaced

      This  appears  on  a FIXUP or SORT operation giving the number of
      TRACKS IEHMAP was able to recover to the format 5 chain.

   MAP037I ddddd TRACKS not replaced

      This  appears  on  a FIXUP or SORT operation giving the number of
      TRACKS  IEHMAP  was not able to add back into the format 5 chain.
      If this appears, another FIXUP or SORT operation should be tried.
      IEHMAP  will add only one format 0 into the format 5 chain during
      any one FIXUP or SORT operation.


   MAP038W VTOC contaminated, warning

      This  appears  when the bos/dos bit is set in the format 4 of the
      VTOC.  This means that the information obtained from the format 5
      chain may be erroneous (neither bos nor dos maintain the format 5
      chain).

   MAP039E f5 does not -> at f5

      This  appears  when  a  format 5 indicated that there was another
      format  5  chained from it, but the DSCB was not a format 5. This
      is  accompainied  by a DUMP of the format 5 and the DSCB that was
      chained from it.

   MAP040W *** output may be erroneous due to errors ***

      This  appears  when some non-terminal error occured to notify the
      user that the output may be inaccurate.

   MAP041I totals for volume

      This  is  the  heading  which  preceeds the totals produced for a
      volume. Messages MAP059I, MAP068I, MAP069I, MAP070I, MAP071I, and
      MAP072I  follow  this  heading.  Also, if there were error in the
      DSCB counts, message MAP060I will follow MAP059I.

   MAP042E "vvvvvv" does not contain catalog

      This appears when the volume specified in the VOL=volid parameter
      of  a  CATLG  control card did not contain a sysctlg dataset (the
      catalog) or the DSNAME given in the CNAME=dsname parameter.

   MAP043W at xxxxxx did not find ICE

      This  appears  when  some  previous  catalog block indicated that
      there  was  an  ice (index control entry) at relative TTR xxxxxx.
      This  is  accompanied  by  a  DUMP of the block found, the IEHMAP
      mapcat control queues, and all catalog blocks currently in core.


   MAP044W at xxxxxx found ICE

      This  appears  when a previous catalog block indicated that there
      was  a non-ice block at relative TTR xxxxxx, and an ice was found
      there.  This  is  accompanied  by  a DUMP of the block found, the
      IEHMAP mapcat control queues, and all catalog blocks currently in
      core.

   MAP045W at xxxxxx found invalid entry type

      This  appears when the catalog block at relative TTR xxxxxx could
      not  be identified as a valid catalog entry. It is accompanied by
      a  DUMP of the block found, the IEHMAP mapcat control queues, and
      all blocks currently in core.

   MAP046E could not find sysres device

      This appears when a CATLG control card with no VOL= parameter was
      in  the  input stream, and the "sysres" volume could not be found
      thru a search of the ucb's.

           This  message  will  probably  never appear -- OS would have
           crashed first.

   MAP047W password protected, no PDS list

      This  appears  when a po dataset was found that was protected for
      read  and  the  OPT=PASS parameter was not specified. This can be
      bypassed  by  using  OPT=PASS  and  supplying the password to the
      system operator.

   MAP048W f0 key not all hex zeroes

      This  appears  when,  on a VERIFY operation, a format 0 was found
      that  did not have a key of 44 hex zeroes. It is accompanied by a
      DUMP of the format 0.

   MAP049W found second f4

      This  appears  when, on a VERIFY operation, a second format 4 was
      found  in  the  VTOC.  It  is accompanied by a DUMP of the second
      format 4.


   MAP050W found unconnected f5

      This  appears  when,  on a VERIFY operation, a format 5 was found
      that  was  not in the format 5 chain. It is accompanied by a DUMP
      of the format 5.

   MAP051W found unconnected f6

      This  appears  when,  on a VERIFY operation, a format 6 was found
      that  was  not in the format 6 chain. It is accompanied by a DUMP
      of the format 6.

   MAP052W found unconnected f2

      This  appears  when,  on a VERIFY operation, a format 2 was found
      that was not connected to a format 1. It is accompanied by a DUMP
      of the format 2.

   MAP053W found unconnected f3

      This  appears  when,  on a VERIFY operation, a format 3 was found
      that  was not in a format 1 chain. It is accompanied by a DUMP of
      the format 3.

   MAP054W found unknown DSCB type

      This  appears  when, on a VERIFY operation, a DSCB was found that
      was  not  a format 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. It is accompanied by a
      DUMP of the DSCB.

   MAP055E VERIFY cancelled, no more core

      This  appears  on  a  VERIFY operation when another block of core
      could not be obtained to save DSCB's in.

.subsub 'Messages in JCL'


 The following messages will appear in the user's JCL.

   MAP090T SYSPRINT did not open

      SYSPRINT or its alternate did not open.

   MAP091W unrecognizable parm

      A  character  string  in the parm field was not recognized by the
      parm field processing routine.

   MAP092W invalid pagesize, default used

      The  linecount  given in the lines= or l= parameter was less than
      10 or greater than 999.

   MAP093W non decimal in parm field

      One  of  the  parameters  passed  via  the parm field contained a
      non-decimal character.

   MAP094W parm field too long

      One  of  the  parameters  passed via the parm field was more than
      three (3) digits long.

   MAP095W max value too low, changed to min+4

      The  value passed in the max= parameter was lower or equal to the
      min= parameter or the default for min=.


.subsection 'Abend Codes'


         IEHMAP will produce a user abend in conditions where it cannot
      recover  from an error. The abend will be preceeded by a severity
      'C' message.

         ABEND CODE 001

         This   is  issued  when  the  savearea  chaining  routine  has
      determined  that  100 saveareas have been chained, and another is
      being  requested.  This  is  probably a loop in the program. This
      will be accompanied by message MAP069C.
