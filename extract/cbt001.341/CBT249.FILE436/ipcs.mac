                      PROBLEM ANALYSIS USING IPCS

THE INTERACTIVE PROBLEM CONTROL SYSTEM (IPCS) IS AN ONLINE FACILITY FOR
DIAGNOSING AND MANAGING PROBLEM INFORMATION AND STATUS.  IT IS A TSO
COMMAND PROCESSOR.  IT IS INSTALLED AT ROCKWELL ISC TO FUNCTION WITH A
NUMBER OF ENHANCEMENTS TO MAKE THE TASK OF PROBLEM ANALYSIS EASIER.  IT
HAS BASICALLY BEEN FRONT ENDED BY A NUMBER OF CLIST MENUS AND WORKS IN
HARMONY WITH ISPF.  IPCS CAN ALSO BE RUN IN NATIVE MODE WITH OUT THE
ADVANTAGE OF THE ENHANCEMENTS.

IPCS REQUIRES A REGION SIZE OF 1.5 MEGABYTES TO RUN.  IF THE DEFAULT TSO
REGION SIZE FOR YOUR SYSTEM IS LESS THAN 1.5 MEGABYTES YOU WILL HAVE TO
SPECIFY THE PARAMETER SIZE(1500) AT LOGON TIME.

IPCS SUBCOMMANDS MAY BE CONSIDERED TO FALL INTO PROBLEM MANAGEMENT
SUBCOMMANDS AND PROBLEM ANALYSIS SUBCOMMANDS.  SINCE THE
INFORMATION/MANAGEMENT FEATURE OF MVS INFORMATION/SYSTEM IS NOW THE TOOL
OF CHOICE FOR PROBLEM MANAGEMENT AT ROCKWELL, THE IPCS PROBLEM/DATA
MANAGEMENT SUBCOMMANDS WILL NOT BE CONSIDERED HEREIN.

IN ORDER TO USE IPCS FOR DUMP ANALYSIS, IT IS NECESSARY TO ALLOCATE THE
IPSF LIBRARYS, THE PROBLEM DIRECTORY (PDR) AND THE DATA SET DIRECTORY
(DSD) DATA SETS.  THIS IS MOST EASILY ACCOMPLISHED BY EXECUTING THE
CLIST:

          -- on WCC1 --                      -- on WCC2 --
    EXEC 'AOST.CLIST(PREIPCS)'   or     EXEC 'AOST.CLIST(PREIPCS2)'

THIS ALLOCATES REQUIRED DATA SETS AND ALSO PROVIDES YOU WITH CUSTOMIZED
COMMANDS FOR THE ROCKWELL ENVIRONMENT.

IF YOU ARE A USING IPCS FOR THE FIRST TIME ADD THE 'NEW' PARAMETER
TO THE TSO COMMAND:

    EXEC 'AOST.CLIST(PREIPCS)' 'NEW'

*   NEW SPECIFIES THAT A NEW IPCSPARM DATA SET AND A NEW DUMP DIRECTORY
    ARE TO BE ALLOCATED AND INITIALIZED.  IF NOT SPECIFIED THE DEFAULT
    IS TO USE AN EXISTING IPCSPARM DATA SET AND DUMP DIRECTORY.

IF YOU ARE EXPERIENCING PROBLEMS AND WANT TO DIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM ADD
'DEBUG' TO THE TSO COMMAND:

    EXEC 'AOST.CLIST(PREIPCS)' 'DEBUG'

*   DEBUG SPECIFIES THAT ALL CLIST LIST OPTIONS ARE TO BE ACTIVATED.
    THIS IS PRIMARILY DESIGNED FOR DEBUGGING CHANGES TO THE CLIST.
    PLEASE REPORT ANY AND ALL PROBLEMS REGARDING IPCS TO CONTROL SOFT-
    WARE SERVICES.

IF HAVE ALREADY EXECUTED 'AOST.CLIST(PREIPCS)' TO ALLOCATE ISPF
LIBRARIES AND YOU HAVE GOTTEN OUT OF IPCS - YOU CAN RETURN BY
EXECUTING THE CLIST:

    EXEC 'AOST.CLIST(IPCS)'

IPCS PROBLEM ANALYSIS SUBCOMMANDS PERMIT YOU TO VIEW AND ANALYZE DUMP
DATA SETS ASSOCIATED WITH IPCS.

*   YOU CAN EXECUTE IPCS ANALYSIS SUBCOMMANDS TO SUMMARIZE THE STATUS OF
    ADDRESS SPACES, TCBS, OR SPECIFIC COMPONENTS IN THE DUMP.

*   DATA DISPLAY SUBCOMMANDS ALLOW YOU TO LIST OR FIND DATA IN THE DUMP.
    A FULL SCREEN MODE IS PROVIDED TO MAXIMIZE DATA PRESENTATION AND
    ALLOW RELATED AREAS OF THE DUMP TO BE DISPLAYED SIMULTANEOUSLY.

*   YOU MAY ASSIGN SYMBOLIC NAMES AND COMMENTS TO AREAS OF THE DUMP AND
    LATER RETRIEVE THOSE AREAS BY SPECIFYING THE SYMBOL NAME.

*   OTHER SUBCOMMANDS ARE AVAILABLE TO ASSIST YOU BY LOCATING,
    DISPLAYING, AND HIGHLIGHTING CONTROL BLOCKS AND MODULES.

*   TSO CLIST SUPPORT FOR IPCS SUBCOMMANDS ALLOWS YOU TO CREATE GENERAL
    ANALYTICAL PROCEDURES AND INVOKE THE PROCEDURES FOR ANY DUMP.

*   IPCS MAY BE USED TO ANALYZE STAND ALONE DUMPS (PRODUCED BY THE
    HIGH-SPEED OPTION OF AMDSADMP), SVC OR SDUMPS, AND SYSMDUMPS.
