    IDACATFX:

    This program is designed to make repairs to a VSAM catalog. Also
    it is intended to be run on enhanced VSAM catalogs only (non-ICF).


.subsection 'Execution JCL:'

  Once the program has been linked, use the following to invoke it:
       //CATFIX   EXEC  PGM=CATFIX,PARM='CATALOG PASSWORD'
       //SYSPRINT DD    SYSOUT=A
       //STEPCAT  DD    DSN=CATALOG NAME,DISP=SHR  (IF USER CATALOG)
       //VSAMCAT  DD    DSN=CATALOG NAME,DISP=SHR
       //SYSIN    DD          (OPTIONAL)
        Commands and operands
       /*

   The commands and operands may be provided by either the SYSIN
   data set, or if the SYSIN DD is missing, by prompt to the operator
   console. The input is FREE form. That is, the commands may be
   anywhere in the input statement or may span cards.
   You may have more that one command on a card.  The commands
   operands must follow the verb.
   If the commands are to be entered via the operators console, each
   command and operand will be prompted for if not provided in the
   initial input. During the execution of the commands which alter
   the catalog an ENQ/RESERVE is issued which will lock out other
   users. This may cause significant performance impact if the
   command is long running such as the 'FCHAIN' command.

.subsection 'Commands:'

      ENQUE-    causes a exclusive enque to be issued for the catalog.
                This command used to test the RESERVE logic of the
                hardware and IOS.

      DEQUE-    clears up the enque from above

      ADD-      ***this command has been deleted from this version***

     DELETE-    this command erases an entry from the catalog
                or places a CI from the low key range on the
                freechain.

          DELETE DSN=name CI=nnnnnn x RBA=nnnn x

               DSN=name     if the command is being used to erase an
                            entry from the high key range, name is the
                            name of the high key range record to be
                            erased.

              CI=nnnnnn x   this form of the delete command places a
                            a CI#'nnnnnn' with a record type of 'x'
                            (offset x'2c' of the catalog record) back
                            FREE CI chain. ****Caution**** see note1

              RBA=nnnn x    this form of the delete command places a
                            CI from the low key range with an RBA of
                            'nnnn' and a record type of 'x' back on
                            the FREE CI chain. **Caution** see note1

               If DSN= is used the full name must be supplied from
               SYSIN. If entered from prompts, a generic name may be
               entered. If CI= is used and an attempt is made to
               delete CI#s 0-15 the request will be failed. When the
               request is entered through SYSIN and CI= or RBA= is
               used the record type must be supplied (x) so that
               CATFIX can verify the record type being deleted.


               ************************Note1*************************
               * if the CI= or RBA= value indicates a CI that has a *
               * record type of "F" you must insure that that CI is *
               * not already on the freechain as this program does  *
               * not insure this and will cause a loop in your chain*
               * of FREE CIs. The FCHAIN command can be used to     *
               * rechain FREE CIs if you are not sure your CI is    *
               * FREE or if you inadvertantly delete a CI that was  *
               * already on the chain.                              *
               ******************************************************


     ZAP-      this command alters data within catalog records
               similar to how imaspzap does.

          Format1.
          ZAP CI=nnnnnn VER 0000 00000000 REP 0000 00000000

                 CI=nnnnnn  use this format when the record to be
                            altered in the low key range has a CI
                            number of 'nnnnnn'.

         Format2.
         ZAP RBA=nnnn VER 0000 0000,0000 REP 0000 0000,0000

               RBA=nnnn   use this format when the record to be altered
                          in the low key range has an RBA of 'nnnn'.


               The VER and REP data is standard format. May be
               up to 2 words of data and may use comas between
               half words.

                If alteration of the high key range of the catalog
                is desired the 'ADD' and 'DELETE' functions must
                be used. Atleration of the high key range via the
                ZAP command is not allowed because it would be
                likely to alter the keys of records and thus be
                an integrety exposure.

     FCHAIN-  this command will cause the catalogs FREE chain to
              be rebuilt. If during processing a mismatch between
              RBA and its key is found, the first mismatch record
              will be printed, but the FREE chain rebuild will
              continue.

          FCHAIN    -no operands-

               This command reads the catalog starting from the low
               end of the low key range and searches for a record
               with an 'F' at offset x'2C'. Each record found is
               chained onto the newly built freechain. You should be
               aware that the function reads the entire low key range
               so performance is dependent on the size of the catalog.


     DISPLAY-  this command will display requested catalog records
               on the operators console.

     PRINT     this command has the same format as the display
               command. The difference between the two commands
               is that output from the print command will be
               written to the system output printer where output
               from display will be written to the operators
               console.

          Display DSN=name CI=nnnnnn RBA=nnnn INDEX ALL

          Print   -- same operands as display --

             DSN=Name  in this form the display command will display
                       the full CI from the high key range that
                       contains the true name record reqested. If
                       the command is entered in the following format
                       (with an * preceeding the name) DSN=*name
                       the CI from the low key range that is pointed
                       to by the true name record is also displayed
                       and all associated CIs.

             CI=nnnnnn in this form the CI from the low key range is
                       displayed on the console. This form cannot be
                       used to display from the high key range.

             RBA=nnnn  in this form the display command will display the
                       full CI at the requested RBA.

             INDEX     the entire index portion of the catalog will be
                       displayed on the console. IDACATFX is the only
                       tool that can print the index portion of a
                       catalog. If the catalog is large you should use
                       print command to obtain a copy of the index
                       rather than display.

              ALL      the entire catalog is displayed on the console.
                       Normally if a listing of the catalog is needed
                       the print command would be more desirable than
                       display because of the volume of output.


     PUNCH      this command creates a deck of cards that can be
                used to re-define all the non-VSAM datasets in
                the catalog. You must have a 'SYSPUNCH' DD card to
                use this command. This command should be used when
                a complete catalog rebuild is required to avoid
                having to create the define statements manually.

                PUNCH ALL   this will cause CATFIX to read the lowkey
                            range 3 times.  First pass will punch out
                            the GDG records, 2nd the non-VSAM records
                            and last the alias records.
                PUNCH b     in one pass, the catalog's GDG records
                            are punched
                PUNCH a     in one pass, the non-VSAM records
                            are punched
                PUNCH x     in one pass, the alias records are punched.


     MAP        MAP gives statistics about the catalog.  Of importance
                is the 'COUNT OF USED BUT EMPTY CI's'.  This count
                tells you when the catalog is becoming full of
                CIs that were once used but now empty and hence may
                not be used again.  If this count becomes high and
                does not reduce during normal catalog activity, you
                may want to repro the catalog to reclaim the empty
                CIs.
                Also, the 'COUNT OF NEVER USED CI's' is the count
                of true free space.  It is these CIs that CI splits
                will occur in (they are truly free).

     CRA        this command will change processing from the catalog
                to the CRA if:
                1. There is a CRA for the catalog
                2. There is a DDNAME of "VSAMCRA" in the jobstream.
                   This DD name must contain the volser of the disk
                   that the CRA is on that CATFIX is to process.  Some
                   CATFIX commands, such as FCHAIN, are not valid in
                   this mode.  An error message will be issued if you
                   attemp to issue such a command.  You must use
                   "RBA=" process as the CRA is an ESDS and does not
                   have keys for "CI=" or "DSN=" operands.



.subsection 'Installation:'

  Program must be in authorized library to work.

  The following job will link CATFIX into an authorized library.
      //LINK      EXEC  PGM=IEWL,PARM='AC=1'
      //SYSPRINT  DD    SYSOUT=A
      //SYSLMOD   DD    DSN=SYS1.LINKLIB,DISP=SHR
      //SYSUT1    DD    UNIT=3330,SPACE=(CYL,(5,1))
      //SYSLIN    DD
