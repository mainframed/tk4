-----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the second AOST Flash.  It reflects changes and/or enhancements
to the OS&T system.  These changes will be reflected in the next release
of the OS&T Manual.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Attached are new chapters for the OS & T Manual.  Note that the
chapter numbers are 1 thru 4.  In the new manual I do not know what they
will be.  They should be filed as a 'TNL' at the and of the OS & T.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The new chapters are:

How to use Info/Mgmt.  This is an overview and discusses some of the
basic things to be aware of when opening a problem, updating a problem,
closing a problem and transfering a problem.  Also discussed is how to
set up your own SRC library (and what an SRC is).

A new load module compare utility from UCLA/OAC.  This utility will
compare all load modules in two libraries or just a specified load
module.

An enhancement to IPCSCOPY.  These changes are reflected in the AOST
ISPF Panels and will simplify the use of IPCSCOPY while removing
some inherent problems with the original design.

A new ISPF application to display GRS/ENQ information.  This program
is from the SHARE mods tape and may be accessed via option 18 on the
AOST menu.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Pleaseforward any comments, suggestions and/or additions for the OS & T
manual, ISPF panels or libraries to me.
