.pp
This program will compare two load module libraries or two specified
load modules with the allocated libraries.
.pp
This program acts as a pseudo-loader.  It gets and clears two core areas
into which the modules text blocks are read.  Relocatable references are
resolved using a common external symbol table to solve the problems of
different CSECT order and different load points.
.pp
This program is reentrant and reusable.  It can not handle overlay
modules.
.pp
This program comes to us from UCLA/CCN by Lou Rivas (june 1977).

Processing parm:
.br
PARM='NAME1(OFFSET1),NAME2(OFFSET2),COUNT'
.point
(OFFSET#) is optional and takes the form:  (LABEL) where 'LABEL' is a
CSECT or ENTRY in NAME#.  (+NUMBER) where 'NUMBER' is an offset into the
NAME#; 'NUMBER' is assumed hex and 'NUMBER.' is decimal.  (LABEL+NUMBER)
which is the offset into the LABEL.
.point
Count is optional and takes the form 'NUMBER.' or 'NUMBER'.  If count is
not specified, the number of bytes that are compared is the larger of
the two module lengths or the larger of the two CSECT lengths if both
(OFFSET#) specify CSECTs, adjusted by the length in (OFFSET#) as
appropriate.  Count can only be used to reduce the compare length.
.point
If any 'NUMBER' is invalid (e.g. outside module or CSECT), it is
ignored.  If 'LABEL' is not found, it is ignored.
.point
Syntactical errors will cause a 'PARM INVALID' error message.  Wrong
parameters will cause unpredictable results.
.point 1
If the parm is ommited then all modules on I1 will be compared with
corresponding named modules in I2 and WTO's will be done to DDNAME WTO
if present.
.point
JCL:
.br
.fo off
//I1       DD ...              PDS WITH LOAD MODULE NAME1.
//I2       DD ...              PDS WITH LOAD MODULE NAME2.
//SNAP     DD SYSOUT=A,...     OUTPUT FILE/MISMATCHES+SNAP.
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=A,...     OPTIONAL OUTPUT (NO SNAP).
//WTO      DD SYSOUT=A,...     WTO FILE IF NO PARM (ALL)

RETURN CODES:
.point 2
00 - ALL MODULE(S) COMPARED SUCCESSFULLY
.point
04 - COMPARE FAILED (AT LEAST 1 IF 'ALL)
.point
08 - INITIALIZATION FAILED (LAST MODULE IF 'ALL')
