This flash is to document some of the changes to the OS&T system
since the publication of OS&T Manual Version 3.
.pp
Before discussing the changes I would like to once again ask for your
contributions to the OS&T system.  If you have any program, command,
clist, SPF panel, dialog, or ?? which you are using and which would make
the life of your co-workers easier then it belongs in the OS&T system.
Please call me on ext. 1647 or come and talk to me so that your
contributions can enhance the OS&T.  Without your feedback and
contributions this system will not be as effective as it should be.
.pp
These changes are:
.point begin
Addition of COPYCAT, a utility from Argonne National Labs via UCLA via
the CBT Tape, to copy or backup an OS CVOL.  This version has 3375 and
3380 support included.  A copy of the documentation is attached.
.point
A refresh of the ISPF Tools summary for your reference.  Remember that
these tools are available for your use and can simplify your job if
you are creating new ISPF applications or dialogs.
These tools also provide a common interface for the user.  If you have
any of your own tools like these PLEASE contribute them to the OS&T.
.point
MAPVTOC - a program to summarize volume information from a VTOC
including Indexed-VTOC information.  This is a good example of using
the CVAF macros.
.point 2
A menu item on the AOST Program panel has been created to simplify
use of this program.
.point 1
The PRINTOFF TSO command and the related ISPF Panel have been updated to
support the following 3800 printing options:
.point 2

BURST=burster-trimmer-stacker and NOBURST=continuous forms stacker.

a data set on the 3800.
.point 2
FLASH
.point 3
Specifies the forms overlay to be used on the 3800.
.point 1
A new menu item has been added to the AOST Master Application Menu to
allow you to browse the SPF News dataset.  This is accomplished by
executing clist SPFNEWS which will enter ISPF BROWSE or if not under
ISPF then it will use REVIEW to browse the SPF News dataset.
.point end
.pp
Remember you can use the FEEDBACK facility on the AOST ISPF Master
Application Menu.
