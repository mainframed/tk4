.pp
An ISPF Panel and CLIST has been developed to aid in the creation
of output on the Xerox 9700.  This Clist is entered by the X9700 ISPF
panel.
.pp
If you specify D for the copy count then you will be prompted for a
name of a distribution list.  If the list does not exist then you will
be prompted to create it.  This list will be temporary unless you have
an ISPTABL dd allocated and explicitly do a SAVE of the list.
.pp
The output from the distribution list on the Xerox will be
delivered to each individual on the list and one copy to you.
.pp
This application assumes that the input file has ASA carriage
control in column 1.
