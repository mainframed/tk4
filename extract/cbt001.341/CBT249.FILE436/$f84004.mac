This flash is to document some of the additions to the OS&T libraries
since the last FLASH.
These additions are:
.point begin
PDSMATCH
.point 2
A utility to compare the directory of 2 partitioned datasets and
generate a report.  Very valuable in finding the differences and
or duplicates between libraries.
.point 1
SYSREPRO
.point 2
A slick replacement for IEBGENER to duplicate sequential files,
includes several interesting parm options.
.point 1
SHOW and SHOWSPF
.point 2
SHOW is a generalized callable program which extracts information from
common system control blocks and ACF2 and returns that information to
the caller.  This is to provide a single point of change in the future
if/when the control blocks change (i.e. with XA).
.point 2
SHOWSPF is an ISPF program which invokes the SHOW program to extract
and return into ISPF variables system information.
.point 1
CCMC
.point 2
This is a technique to allow all successfully applied SYSMODs at
one center to be transmitted via the BDT/IUP to each of the other
centers and placed into a CCMC PDS.  This will allow each center
to at least be kept current on what maintenance is available and
can be used to assist in maintaining compatability among centers.
.point 1
CCMCTRAN
.point 2
This is utility which will read the SMPLOG dataset and generate
IEBCOPY control cards for every successfully applied SYSMOD.  This
is used by the Source Maintenance System's SMP APPLY process to then
copy those selected SYSMODs to each of the other centers via the
BDT/IUP.

The next version of the OS&T manual will be published the first week
of APRIL.  If you have any comments, suggestions or additions please
contact me as soon as possible.
Remember you can use the FEEDBACK facility on the AOST ISPF Master
Application Menu.
