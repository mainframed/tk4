 A modified version of MACXREF (Alias PROCLIST) is now available in
 SYS1.SERVLIB.  See the appendix for a list of revisions.

 The program will give an alphanumerically ordered listing of all
 members of a partitioned data set (LRECL=80, and REECFM=F or FB), or of
 a single member of a partitioned data set.  Multiple data sets may be
 concatenated. The output is controlled by options selected via the PARM
 field on the EXEC statement.  Available options are:

           LIST, XREF, MACRO, INDEX
           NOLIST,NOXREF,NOMACRO,NOINDEX

 The default set is PARM =(LIST,XREF,NOMACRO,NOINDEX)

 LIST     gives a numbered listing of all statements in a member.
 continuation is recognized by a nonblank character in column 72.

 XREF     gives a cross reference listing of symbolic parameters and
  sequence symbols (as in macros or cataloged procedures).  NOXREF is
  forced on a member basis if no symbolic parameters and sequence
  symbols are found.  Symbololic parameters and sequence symbols are
  recognized by a blind scan of the source text, so it is possible that
  invalid symbols may ocasionally be found.

 MACRO  causes the LIST and XREF options to be suppressed except for
   source code delimited by MACRO and MEND statements.  This may be
   useful when listing source code containingg programmer macros, or
   mixed library containing both macros and other forms of code.

 INDEX gives a cross reference index of symbolic parameter versus member
   name.  The index is derived from a condensation of the XREF
   information, but may be obtaiined even if NOXREF is in effect (NOLIST
   implies NOXREF).  This option will be of value prrimarily for macro
   libraries relying heavily on the use of global symbols or a common
   naming system.  Note again that the scan is blind so that, for
   example, COPY statements are not processed, and all symbols are
   therefore actually mentioned in the member.

 The following DD statements are required:

 SYSLIB defines the partitioned data set to be processed.  If a member
   name is specified as part of the DSNAME, only that member will be
   processed.  Multiple complete PDS's, but not individual members, may
   be concatenated.

 SYSPRINT  defines the printed output.  It is recommennded that the
   parameter DCB=BLKSIZE-996 be included, since the default is unblocked
   output.

.subsection 'Notes:'

 The capability of listing a single PDS member is reinstated.  It was
 lost
 due to more stringent data management error checking in MVT Release
 21.0.

 The working set is reduced.


 A null data set (a PDS with no members) can now be processed without an
 abend.   No output will be printed.

 Specification of a SYSPRINT BLKSIZE less than 129 will now be ignored.
 Unblocked output will be printed.

 Concatenation of SYSLIB  data sets is now accepted.  Concatenations
 were previously ignored.

 The program wil no  longer abend if insufficient main storage is
 available for the symbol table.  Eaach member will always be completely
 printed (if LIST is in effect).  XREF will be suppresssed on a membr
 basis only , with the diagnostic message "INSUFFICIENT MAIN STORAGGE".
 INDEX will be suppressed with the sa e diagnostic message.
