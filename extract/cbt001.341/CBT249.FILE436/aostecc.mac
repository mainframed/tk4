The OS&T libraries supplied and maintained by the WCC at ECC are:
.ju off
.sp
     AOST.CLIST           TSO Clists
     AOST.DOCFMT.MEMO     Waterloo Script Text library
     AOST.DOCFMT.SYSHYPH  Waterloo Script Hyphenation dictionary
     AOST.HELP            TSO Help library for OS&T TSO commands
     AOST.ISPLLIB         ISPF program library
     AOST.ISPMLIB         ISPF Message library
     AOST.ISPPLIB         ISPF Panel library
     AOST.ISPSLIB         ISPF Skeleton library
     AOST.MACLIB          OS&T Assembler Macros
     AOST.LOAD            Load library for all TSO commands and programs

Knowing that the ECC has different requirements than the WCC the
following datasets have been allocated to allow for local changes
without modifying the base libraries.
.ju off
.sp
     AOST.ECC.CLIST       Locally tailored OS&T Clists
     AOST.ECC.ISPMLIB     Locally tailored ISPF messages
     AOST.ECC.ISPPLIB     Locally tailored ISPF panels
     AOST.ECC.ISPSLIB     Locally tailored ISPF skeletons

To enter the AOST ISPF application you will need to do:
.point begin
Insure ACF2 authorization for resource type CMD, resource names
$SYSUTIL (for $C and $P usage), and name @SYSUTIL (for @C and
@P usage).
.point
Insure ACF2 ATTR2 field is set properly to allow access to $C,$P,@C,
@P TSO commands.
.point
Allocate dataset userid.CLIST and create member LOGON using
AOST.ECC.CLIST member PRESAMP as a model.
.point
If you desire to use the ISPF table applications (which you
probably will), then allocate a partitioned dataset with
DCB=(RECFM=FB,LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=multiple of 80)
.point
The PRESAMP and PRESAMP2 clist invoke the PREISPF clist which
was designed in WCC and is used in WCC1, WCC2 and SWC2.  The
PREISPF clist is a generalized technique for allocating all
required ISPF datasets, and at the same time allocating any
user required datasets as well.  By using this technique we
remain somewhat compatible with them.
.point
The PREISPF parameters are:
.ju off
            AUXMLIB    :    Suffix Message library
            AUXPLIB    :    Suffix Panel library
            AUXPROC    :    Suffix CLIST library
            AUXSLIB    :    Suffix Skeleton library
            AUXTLIB    :    Suffix Table library
            LLIB       :    Prefix ISPF LLIB
            PREMLIB    :    Prefix Message library
            PREPLIB    :    Prefix Panel library
            PREPROC    :    Prefix CLIST library
            PRESLIB    :    Prefix Skeleton library
            PRETLIB    :    Prefix Table library
.ju on
.pp
Once you are in the OS&T ISPF application, if you ever return to
TSO READY status and wish to reenter the OS&T ISPF application all you
need to is to execute %AOST.
.pp
The clist is simply the TSO command ISPF PANEL(ISP@MSTR).  This
causes ISPF to enter at the Master Application Menu.
