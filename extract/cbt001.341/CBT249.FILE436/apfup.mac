.subsection 'Description'
.sp
     The APFUP program provides the means to have a common VATLSTxx in
     SYS1.PARMLIB for several systems.  It scans the incore APF list and
     changes every volume serial of XXXXXX to that of the SYSRES volume.
     This allows all system to hare a single entry in the VATLSTxx  for
     data sets like SYS1.APFLIB that resides on the SYSRES volume.
     Otherwise, there would have to be an entry for each SYSRES in our
     VATLSTxx member.
