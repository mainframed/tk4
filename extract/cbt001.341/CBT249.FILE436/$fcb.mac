              $FCB - generate 3211 forms control buffer

    The $FCB macro instruction causes the creation of a CSECT containing
    a Forms Control Buffer image for a 3211 printer.  The macro may be
    used in a stand alone assembly and link edit to produce an FCB image
    load module in SYS1.IMAGELIB.

    This macro was developed using the $FCB macro distributed with HASP
    II Version 4.  The distributed macro was written to generate in-line
    code within HASP.  Further, it did not support left indexing.  (For
    more information about that macro, refer to "OS/VS2 HASP II Version
    4 Logic", IBM form number GY27-7255.)

.subsection 'Usage'

       FCB2xxxx $FCB  i,p,c-l,c-l,...,INDEX=x,DEFAULT=YES

       xxxx - The 4 character image name which will be coded in JCL and
              operator commands.

       i    - the number of lines per inch.  This value must be coded as
              either 6 or 8.

       p    - the number of lines per page.  This corresponds to the
              number of lines per fold on the form.  This means that for
              a 22 line page where the forms are folded once in three
              pages, this parameter would be coded as 66.  The carriage
              channel punches would then be repeated three times in the
              FCB image - once for each page.  This value must range
              between 2 and 180.

       c-l  - carriage punch - line number.  This parameter should be
              specified once for every channel punch required.  The
              parameter is coded by specifying the channel number
              followed by a hyphen (-) and then the line number.  The
              channel number must range between 1 and 12.  Channel 1
              must be specified at least once.  The line number must be
              a value between 1 and the number of lines per page
              specified.

       x    - the index amount.  The keyword parameter "INDEX=x" can be
              omitted.  If it is, then no indexing will be performed.
              If specified, x can be a value from 1 to 31 inclusive for
              right indexing; or -1 to -31 for left indexing.  Right
              indexing means that x is the number of the printer print
              position where the first character of the output record
              will be printed.  Left indexing means that x is the number
              of the data byte that is printed in printer print position
              one.

       Yes  - indicates that this is to be a default image.  The keyword
              parameter "DEFAULT=YES" can be omitted.  If it is omitted,
              the image will not be defined as a default image.  If a
              default image is loaded into the printer and a job does
              not request a specific FCB, then the job will be printed
              using the FCB that is loaded.  This implies that for all
              special forms FCB images this parameter should not be
              coded.

.subsection '   Comments'

       Note the significance of the channel 1 punch.  It is required by
       the printer for the carriage restore function.  Further, consider
       what would happen if channel 1 is defined in line 6.  With HASP,
       an FCB is loaded after the separator page is printed.  At that
       time, the forms are positioned at the first print line on a page.
       When the load occurs, the printer assumes the forms are
       positioned at line 1.  A skip to channel 1 will cause the printer
       to space 5 lines.  Thus, the first print line is now 5 lines down
       the page from where it should be.  All output printed from now
       until an operator wakes up will be skewed by 5 lines.  It is
       recommended that channel one be defined at line one for all FCBs.
       Then this problem will not occur.

       Unspecified channels will be automatically included by the macro
       if sufficient lines are available to do so.  This will prevent
       forms runaway.
