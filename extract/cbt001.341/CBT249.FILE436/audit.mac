.sp 2
.subsection 'Description'

   This program is designed to generate a hash in an accumulator for
   DSORG=PS or DSORG=PO data sets.  The hash is stored in a hash lib
   PDS for audit purposes or is punched out for data-transfer and
   then read from the card (image) for comparison of the hash.

.subsection 'PARM options'

   PARM options are:
         REPORT - generate a hash REPORT only
         AUDIT  - generate a hash REPORT and compare with hash file
         PUNCH  - generate a hash REPORT and PUNCH card (image) hash
                  record
         AUDITC - accumulate hash and compare with hash card

         Default is to generate a hash and store in HASHLIB for
                 DSORG=PO files.

         Options AUDITC and PUNCH are valid only for PS files or
                 dsname(member).

.subsection 'DD Statements'

         REPORT   - REPORT file
         HASHIN   - file to be hashed
           or
         @xxxxx   - file names to be hashed
                    (DSORG=PS or dsn(member) only)
         PDS      - same as HASHIN if HASHIN is a PDS
         HASHLIB  - PDS where hash record will be stored or audited
                    (not used for REPORT,PUNCH,AUDITC options)
         SYSIN    - option AUDITC input hash card record
         SYSPUNCH - option PUNCH card record of hash
         COPYCC   - option AUDIT: output will be IEBCOPY cards for
                    new or changed members.

.subsection 'Notes'

  Caveats:  SPF PDS's have statistics and a record may not change
            contents but the level in col 79-80 could change.

            Load libraries: superzap sets IDR records with date
            of zap, link changes date which can change the hash.
