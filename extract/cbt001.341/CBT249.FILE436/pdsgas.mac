Description:  This program reads a PDS and finds "gas"
members, i.e. members that have been deleted but have
not been compressed out yet.

 DDNAMEs required:
   SYSLIB    -  input PDS
   SYSPRINT  -  output messages

 If PARM=ADD is specified, the program will add a member
 name to the directory for each "gas" member.

 The added member names all begin with '$GAS', followed
 by a 4 digit sequence number.

 If PARM=TTR(tt.tt.rr) is specified, the program will add
 a member name to the directory for the "gas" member
 having the specified TTR location (in hex, obtained from
 a previous run). This is useful if PARM=ADD causes the
 directory to fill up, or if you know which one you want.

 For very large PDS's you may want to specify PARM=ADD
 the first time, because this program reads every block
 in the PDS.  It may be quicker to delete all the
 generated member names than to run it a second time.

 Any user data that was in the directory entry of
 a deleted or replaced member cannot be recovered.

 A note about load modules.  This program cannot recover
 a "gas" load module.  It will give it a member name so
 it wont be compressed out, but the directory entry will
 not be a load module type.  To reconstruct the proper
 load module directory would require information that
 is no longer in the PDS.
