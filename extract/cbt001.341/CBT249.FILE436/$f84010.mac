This flash is to document some of the changes to the OS&T system
since the publication of OS&T Manual Version 3.
Note Version 3.1 will be published soon if you have any changes or
additions to the OS&T Manual.
.pp
These changes are:
.point begin
The addition of BRODSCAN to analyze the SYS1.BRODCAST dataset and
report on a variety of statistics.
.point
Added documentation on how the AOST system is installed at the ECC.
.point
Added documentation for a slick tape copy/list utility.
.point
The SHOW and SHOWSPF programs have been updated to provide the option
of retrieving the name of the current center (i.e. NJE NODE).  This
information is found in the CVTSNAME field after the CPU id and is
supplied at IPL time in IEASYSxx as parameter SYSNAME=x#node where
x = current CPU, # is a delimeter for the cpu name and node is the
current NJE node (such as WCC1).
.point
A new panel is available for use with the DIRBUILD ISPF utility,
MEMSELP and a corresponding tutorial panel TMEMSELP.
.pp
This facility is now being used by the Xerox 2700 and Xerox 9700
dialogs.
.point
A new ISPF Dialog is available from the AOST menu to create requirements
for SHARE or GUIDE.
.pp
The output is a form which can be printed on the Xerox 2700 or 9700, and
it is in the correct format for submission.  If you are aware of any
areas of IBM software which you feel should be changed, but are not
APARable, create a requirement and forward it to the SHARE or GUIDE
representative or to myself and I will forward it to the appropriate
individual.
.pp
These requirements tell IBM what their customers want in terms of
changes or enhancements.  They will be voted upon by a group of IBM
customers at SHARE or GUIDE and will then be given to IBM as
requirements from a large number of customers (not just one).
.point
Removed documentation for the following programs since the source has
never been supplied to the AOST system and due to space restrictions in
the Waterloo Script formatting:  CATSRCH, CHKDUPES, DATECHG, DLIBXREF,
EQUMAP, GENDIF, GENLIST, PACKS, POPS, POSTGEN, PREJOB, SGMAP, SGMAPCM,
TPINIT.
.point end
.pp
Remember you can use the FEEDBACK facility on the AOST ISPF Master
Application Menu.
