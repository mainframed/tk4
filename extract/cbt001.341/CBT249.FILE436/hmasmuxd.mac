.ix HMASMUXD
.pp
This exit will receive control for all records for every SYSMOD that
SMP attempts to receive.  A check is made to determine the type of
processing (i.e. Receive exit) since this exit can be invoked for
x37 processing as well (which this code does not support at this time).
.pp
A check is then made to determine
which receive processing option the user requested.
This is done by testing for the presence of a DD in the TIOT having
the form EXITx.
Where the x in the DDname determines the type of receive processing
to be done.
.pp
If x is I then the exit will verify that every USERMOD processed
conforms to the source maintenance coding standards.  Which state
that all source/macro USERMOD's
.us MUST
have the USERMOD id in columns 65 thru 71 of every update record,
and that an @ is found in column 64 to indicate that 65-71 are the
USERMOD id and not comments.
.pp
If x = D then the exit will cause all ++MOD processing to be bypassed.
This is for a source maintained system and insures that if the user
forgets to specify ASSEM on the SMP APPLY control card, that a
vanilla object does not get linkedited.
.pp
If x = B then both of the above actions will be performed.
.pp
If x = anything else or the DD is not found then the exit returns to
SMP and informs SMP never to call it again.
.pp
Note: The USERMOD ID check is not made for ++SRC or ++MAC at this time
as they are total replacements and the SMP will provide adequete
protection via the RMID check at APPLY time.
.pp
The EXITx DD should be a SYSOUT file as the exit will write a message
for every action that it takes.  It indicates whether a ++MOD has
been suppressed and/of if a USERMOD receive is being cancelled due to
an invalid id in the update control cards.
