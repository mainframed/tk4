.pp
This program compares the directories of two partitioned data sets and
prints a report showing which members match and which members do not
match or are not present in both directories.
.pp
Members are said to match if their names are the same, and (if
PARM=USER) if all the other data in their directory entries are equal
(except fields containing ttr track addresses).
.pp
Data records for the members are not compared.  Only the information in
the directory is compared.

USER
.point 2
Members that are present in both libraries will be compared for matching
userdata.  Userdata consists of up to 64 bytes of data in the directory
entry which is put there by the linkage editor, SPF edit, and others.
NOTE: With parm=USER, if two members have the same name and neither has
any userdata, they are treated as unequal, with a unique message for
this case.
.point 1
EQO
.point 2
Only members that match will be listed.
.point 1
NEO or SHORT
.point 2
Only members that don't match will be listed.
.point 1
None of the above
.point 2
All members will be listed for both libraries.
.point 1
LINK
.point 2
Same as PARM=USER except the linkedit data is compared and only the
deltas are reported.
