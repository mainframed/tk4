  This TSO command will compress a partitioned data set by invoking the
  IEBCOPY utility program.  However, this program may abend with an 0C4
  before invoking IEBCOPY.  This is because the program was linkedited
  as RENT but is not and resides in an authorized library.
  ** warning if the system goes down the data set being compressed
                may become unusable.   **
