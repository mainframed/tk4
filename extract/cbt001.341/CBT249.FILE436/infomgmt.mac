.section 'Information/Management'
.ix Information/Management
.subsection 'Overview'
.pp
Information/Management is an IBM product design to track problem
records and change requests.  Here at Rockwell we are currently only
tracking problems, change requests are still maintained and tracked
manually.
.subsection 'How to Enter Info/Mgmt'
.pp
Info/Mgmt can be entered thru the AOST ISPF system using the IBM
menu on the AOST ISPF master application menu.  Info/Mgmt is option
8 on the IBM menu.
.pp
Upon getting to the Info/Mgmt panel you will be prompted to enter the
name of the stored response chain (SRC) library to be used.  This is a
library of canned Info/Mgmt functions which are similiar in function
to TSO clists.
.pp
There are currently two(2) specialized SRC libraries:
.point begin
AMVS.INFO.BLGSRC for 205/620
.point
JES3.INFO.BLGSRC for 205/630
.point end
.pp
The SRC's that have been created for the AMVS and JES3 libraries are
designed to simplify problem assignment, problem creation, problem
transfer, problem close.  These SRC's are individualized for each
person in the group.
.pp
There is also a standard SRC library supported by the Service Control
group.  It's dataset name is $ASERV.INFO.BLGSRC, which is the default
on the panel.
.pp
Included in the standard SRC library are several SRC's to do
standard processing.  These SRC's are:
.point begin
REPORTER
.point 2
This SRC will open a problem and prompt you for all required fields.
.point 1
TRANSFER or XFER
.point 2
This SRC will transfer a problem to another individual.
.point end
.pp
After updating the SRC library name, depress enter and the Info/Mgmt
index menu will be displayed.  This menu is useless for most of our
uses.
.subsection 'Basic Functions'
.pp
Some of the basic functions which are commonly used are:
.point begin
SRC Execution.
.point 2
At most panels within Info/Mgmt you can enter EX and receive a panel
prompting you with a list of available SRC's.  You can execute and
SRC by entering the SRC number found to the left of the description.
SRC's are available for opening a problem, transfering a problem,
generating a report of problems and closing a problem.  See the
discussion below on how to generate your own SRC should you desire
one.
.point 1
Problem Display
.point 2
To display an existing problem enter from the Info/Mgmt index menu:
.sp
DI R xxxx
.sp
This command will Display Record xxxx,  where xxxx is the problem record
number.
.point 1
Update a Problem
.point 2
To update an existing problem enter from the Info/Mgmt index menu:
.sp
U R xxxx
.sp
This command will Update Record xxxx,  where xxxx is the problem record
number.
.point
The Problem Entry panel will now be displayed.  From here you can change
the Status(2), Supplemental(6) or Text(8).  The other options are not
really of interest.
.point
Status Update
.point 3
You can change or update the programmer assigned to the problem, the
person responsible for tracking the problem, the problem status, the
priority, plus many other items.
.point
Problem Status
.us should
be XFER when you change the Assignee name.
.point 2
Supplemental Update
.point 3
This panel should be used when you have a PTF, APAR or support center
problem number.  If a vendor is working on the problem then the vendor
status should be updated and any other field which would provide
information to
either
the vendor or another systems programmer to work on the problem.
.point
When IBM determines that a problem is a new problem, they will assign
an APAR number to the problem.  The APAR number you get should be
added to the information in this panel.
.point 2
Text Update
.point 3
The Text Entry consists of 4 parts.  Only 3 are meaningful for our
purposes.
.point
Description.  This part should consist of the description of the problem
with as much information as is available.  Including any dump dataset
names,  symptoms,  product level (PUT, PTF, APAR, etc), and any
contacts if needed to test/assist in problem resolution.
.point
Status.  This part should be updated whenever the status of the problem
changes.  For example, when level 2 calls, when more information is
requested, when a test is run, when a fix is supplied, etc.
.point
Resolution.  This part should be updated when the final solution to the
problem has been received, tested and applied.
.point 2
After updating the problem record you must file it so that the data
base record is updated.  This is done via option FILE(9) on the
Problem Entry panel.
.point 1
Opening a Problem
.point 2
There are three ways to open a problem.
.point 3
First, you can have an SRC to do the basics for you.  See the below on
how to build your own SRC's.
.point
Second, if you use the standard SRC library, you can enter EX REPORTER.
This SRC will prompt you for the required information.
.point
Third, and more complicated, you can do the following:
.fo off
.br
a)  From the Info/Mgmt Primary Options Menu enter 4.
.br
b)  Then enter 1 to open a problem.
.br
c)  Enter all required information on the Problem Reporter Panel.
.br
d)  If you wish to assign the problem to another person enter EX and
    select number to execute the XFER SRC.  Then fill in all required
    information on the Status panel.
.br
e)  Enter 9 to file/save the problem.  Be sure to note the problem
    number.
.fo on
.point 1
Closing a Problem.
.point 2
Enter U R xxxx, where xxxx is the record number to be closed.
.point
Select the Status Panel (2) to update.
.point
Update the Problem Status Panel with the appropriate information to
close the problem.
.point
Select the Text (8) panel and then the Resolution sub-panel (3).
.point
Update the text resolution panel with a description on why the problem
is being closed.
.point
Then be sure to file/save the record, option 9.
.point
or U R xxxx then EX XFER
.point 1
Transfer a Problem.
.point 2
Enter U R xxxx, where xxxx is the record number to be closed.
.point
Select the Status Panel (2) to update.
.point
Update the Problem Status Panel with the appropriate information to
transfer the problem.  Note that the problem status should be XFER.
.point
Then be sure to file/save the record, option 9.
.point 1
Common Commands
.point 2
Quit -  This command will cause you to exit Info/Mgmt from any panel.
.point
Back -  This command will return you to the prior panel most of the
time.
.point
Index - This command will return you to the index panel.
.point end
.subsection 'Custom SRC Library'
.pp
To build your own customized SRC library you will need to:
.point begin
Allocate a PDS with DCB=(RECFM=FB,LRECL=200,BLKSIZE=6200)
.point
Copy from JES3.INFO.BLGSRC the following members:
.point 2
AMODEL    -   Assign a problem to Model
.br
CMODEL    -   Close a problem for Model
.br
OMODEL    -   Open a problem for Model
.br
SMODEL    -   Search for all problems assigned to Model
.br
XFER      -   Transfer a problem to ????
.point 1
You should now rename each of these members to Aname, Cname, etc.
.point
Next enter ISPF EDIT and change the appropriate information in the
SRC record.
.point
Allocate a PDS with DCB=(RECFM=F,LRECL=600,BLKSIZE=600).  This is the
correct format for an SRC library.
.point
Copy from your PDS to this new PDS.
.point
To use an SRC enter EX on any panel and only those SRC's which apply
will be displayed on a menu for you to select from.
.point end
.subsection 'Info/Mgmt Searches'
.pp
At times you will want to look at a group of related problems.  To do
this you can use the SEarch command.  The syntax of the Search command
is:   SE arg  arg.
.point begin
The argument may be any word or words to be searched for.
.point
If you do not designate the type of search to be performed then just the
description text will be searched.
.point
To restrict the search to a specific field other than the description
you must enter the arg as: type/string
.point 2
Some of the more common types used are:
.fo off
.point 3
GROA/dept     -  Group assigned/dept        SE GROA/205
.br
or
GROA/dept/grp -  Group assigned/dept/group  SE GROA/205/630
.point
NUMV/number   -  Vendor number/number       SE NUMV/9X000
.point
PERA/name     -  Person assigned/name       SE PERA/NORRIS
.point
PRIO/number   -  Current priority/number    SE PRIO/01
.point
STAC/status   -  Activity/Change status     SE STAC/OPEN
.point
STAV/status   -  Vendor status/status       SE STAV/OPEN
.point end
.fo on
