-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the third AOST Flash.  It reflects changes and/or enhancements
to the OS&T system.  These changes will be reflected in the next release
of the OS&T Manual.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Theses updates may be filed at the beginning of the OS & T, or the end
for reference until a new release of the manual is published.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Included in this Flash are:

A new approach to entering the AOST ISPF Panels using the system
supplied PREISPF clists.  This will remove the dependency on knowing the
system ISPF libraries.

Note: You should convert to this technique at your earlist opportunity,
as the current technique will only be supported until 1/05/84 when the
AOSTISPF and AOSTPDF clists will be deleted.

The ISPF and PDF clists in AOST.TEXT have been updated to use this
technique.

A new facility is provided on the AOST Master Application Menu to let me
know of any questions, comments, problems or suggestions for improvement
to the OS & T system.  Using option F for Feedback you can enter upto 12
lines of text.  This will then generate a batch job which will be sent
via NJE if necessary to WCC1 to update a feedback dataset.

I will periodically review the feedback and if appropriate I will call
with a response.  This should make it easier to provide feedback to me
on whats right and whats wrong with the OS&T manual, the OS&T ISPF
panels, OS&T programs, etc.

A utility from the LA MVS User Group Tape to list OS CVOL's, inform of
used space and correct CVOL errors.  This was included at the request of
MCC.

Note that if you are using the new ISPF/PDF product and invoke FLIST
from the Master Application Menu, you will be using a new version which
only works under the new ISPF/PDF.  This version is an assembler program
and not a clist as the prior version, so it can do more things in a more
efficient manner.  See the tutorial for the list of options and commands
available to you.

Added an option to the Xerox panel to allow output with no holes.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Please forward any comments, suggestions and/or additions for the OS & T
manual, ISPF panels or libraries to me.
