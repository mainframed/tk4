This flash is to document some of the changes to the OS&T system
since the publication of OS&T Manual Version 3.
Note that the Version 3 manual superceeded all previous OS&T Flashes.
.pp
These changes are:
.point begin
An alternate ISPF Master Application Menu is available named AOSTMSTR
to allow other's to access the AOST Master.
.point
The latest version of the CBT Share MVS Mods tape has been received and
is available on the 3850 under index AOST.CBT.   The first file on the
tape (AOST.CBT.FILE001.DATA) is a directory of every file on the tape.
.point 1
AMDPSCAN
.point 2
An updated version of this AMDPRDMP exit has been received and is now
available in AOST.LOAD.  No change in the documentation was made
however.
.point 1
CCMCDOC
.point 2
The documentation has been updated to reflect a new option on the ISPF
SMP Menu to allow the user to receive the CCMC Dataset into the SMP PTS.
This should further simplify the use of the CCMC.
.point 1
PDS
.point 2
A new version of the PDS command has been received and is now available
in AOST.LOAD using the $C TSO command.  This version is a dramatic
enhancement over the current production PDS and a slight improvement
over the current AOST version.
.point end
.pp
Remember you can use the FEEDBACK facility on the AOST ISPF Master
Application Menu.
