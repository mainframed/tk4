.subsection 'Description'
The JES3 activity reporting system is a combination of 2 programs.
The first, J3ACTSMF, is the data extractor and J3ACTRPT is the
report generator.  Note that J3ACTSMF is also capable of generating a
report.
.subsection 'J3ACTSMF'
This program reads the SMF dump tapes and processes the 6 (output),
26 (purge) and 57 (NJE) records.  The output is a summary record which
is added to the J3ACT history file and optionally 4 reports, identical
to those generated by J3ACTRPT, for the time period of the SMF records.

The JCL to execute J3ACTSMF is:

.in +10;.fo off
//step   EXEC PGM=J3ACTSMF,PARM=center-id
//SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=A  or  DUMMY
//HISTORY   DD DSN=history dataset,DISP=(MOD,KEEP)
//SMFTAPE   DD DSN=smf unload tape
.in -10;fo on

Note that the PARM is required.  It is used to identify the center
(JES3 global complex id or NJE node) for use in identifying the
history records for later analysis.

The reports are described in the secion on J3ACTRPT below.
.subsection J3ACTRPT
This utility will process the history file created by J3ACTSMF and
generate up to 4 different reports.

The JCL to execute J3ACTRPT is:

.in +10;.fo off
//step   EXEC PGM=J3ACTRPT
//SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=A
//HISTORY   DD DSN=history dataset,DISP=SHR
//SYSIN     DD *   control cards (optional)
.in -10;fo on

The control cards define the bounds of the generated reports and
are optional.  If there are no control cards then all reports will
be generated covering the entire history file.

All control cards start in column 1 and only one keyword is allowed
per card.

The control cards are:

.in +10
REPORT=
.in +20
Valid options:
SOC for Sysout Class report
PRT for Printer/Destination report
JOB for Job Class report
NJE for NJE activity report
ALL for all reports (default)
.in -20
s.p
NODE=center-id or ALL (default=ALL)
s.p
SOC=class code for limiting
.in +20
The class code can be derived by
looking at a sysout class report.
.in -20
.sp
PRT=printer-id (or prefix)
.in +20
Limits the sysout class and printer
reports to specific printer id or
printer prefix.
