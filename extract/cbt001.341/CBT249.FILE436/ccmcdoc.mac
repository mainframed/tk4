With the introduction of JES3 SP 1.3.1 within the Rockwell computing
environment, the need has been expressed to have all centers at the
same maintenance level.  To accomplish this we have enhanced our
current source maintenance system to include a facility called
Cross Center Maintenance Compatability or CCMC for short.
.pp
CCMC is initiated whenever we APPLY via SMP any USERMOD, APAR or PTF
using the SMPBATCH ISPF Panel.  CCMC will determine from the SMP
APPLY processing which sysmods have been successfully applied and then
initiate a BDT/IUP transfer of those sysmods from our PTS to a dataset
at each of the other centers (which can be designated on the CCMC
ISPF panel).
.pp
The CCMC dataset is a PDS with a standard dataset name of
index.center.SYSMODS. For exampe for JES3 the index is JES3 and center
is ECC, MCC, SWCC or WCC.  This will allow CCMC to be used in every
center within Rockwell.
.pp
This technique should allow each center to be kept as current as
possible on maintenance.
.pp
Each center should establish this dataset and periodically
browse it.  If there is anything in it, and they wish to APPLY it,
they should unload the PDS to a sequential file and RECEIVE it with
SMP.  The PDS should then be reset to empty so that they will be
able to determine when new sysmods are received.
.pp
NOTE: Appropriate ACF2 rules need to be in place to allow these datasets
to be updated.
.pp
To facilitate receiving into the SMP PTS from the CCMC dataset an option
has been added to the ISPF CCMC menu which will provide the user with a
simple interface to unload the CCMC PDS into a format acceptable by SMP
RECEIVE processing.  The user is then placed into the SMP Receive
processing ISPF panel to do the actual RECEIVE.  After the Receive the
user is then placed into the ISPF EMPTY panel to allow the user to reset
the CCMC dataset to an empty state.
.pp
There are two ISPF skeletons in AOST.ISPSLIB CCMCTRAN and CCMCBDT.  To
use CCMC include in your SMP JCL ISPF Skeleton the following control
statement:
.sp
.in +10
)IM CCMCTRAN
.in -10
.pp
This will imbed into your Skeleton JCL the CCMCTRAN jcl and will
then do an imbed of CCMCBDT to do the actual transmission.
.pp
Your Skeleton JCL must also have a test for CCMC equal to YES and
if YES then must allocate the SMPLOG file to DSN=&&SMPLOG with a
DISP=(,PASS).
.pp
To facilitate communication concerning CCMC information a dataset should
be established in each center having the name of index.center.NOTES.
The DCB should be RECFM=FBA,LRECL=80,DSORG=PS and any optimal BLKSIZE.
An option has been provided on the CCMC menu to create, send and receive
information among the centers using this dataset.
