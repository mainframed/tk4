  Function/Operation:  Reads and edits the volume table of contents
         (VTOC) from one or more direct access volumes and prints
         information about the data sets on it and a track usage MAP.
         Optionally, it lists the directory of each partitioned data
         set on the volume.
  Input:  The parameter field referenced by R1 begins with a half-word
         containing the binary length of the byte string which follows
         it.  The string consists of a series of parameter words
         separated by commas.  Legal words are:
               DUMP    causes the DSCB's to be listed in hex following
                       their formatted listings.
               PDS     causes the directory of each PDS to be listed.
               MAP     causes the track usage MAP to be printed.
  Output:  A printed listing describing the data sets and track usage
         for each volume.
  Data sets:  Printed output is delivered to a data set described on a
         dd card with ddname 'SYSPRINT'.  Each volume to be listed must
         have a DD card with the ddname "VOL.....", Where only the
         first three characters are tested.  The DD cards are
         required to specify only the volume serial, unit.
  Exits-normal:  Returns via reg 14 with return code 0.
  Exits-error:  Returns via reg 14 with return codes as follows:
         4 - missing DD card;
         8 - bad format in a DSCB;
         12 - permanent I/O error in a VTOC or PDS directory;
         20 - unable to open 'SYSPRINT' data set.
