  Function   : To process held SYSOUT data-sets for the currently
               running job by:
               1) selecting all BAL listings to
                  FICHE and-or to the specified output
                  VOLUME or MSVGP
               2) selecting all non-BAL listings to
                  DD other
               3) copying all INPUT to copy DD
               4) IDCAMS is invoked to delete and uncatalog the
                  listing file prior to allocation on MSS or dasd

               The FICHE DD statement is dynamically allocated
               and freed for each assembly listing.  If you are
               under JES3 then you will need to have a FORMAT PR card
               specifying the output DEST and FORM # or ---
               you can change the ALLOC macro for the FICHE DD to
               include the DEST and FORM #
               (FORM # is a max of 4 characters for DYNALLOC)

               The output should in SYSOUT=(A,wtrname) to be
               processed.  It should not be in a TSO hold class !!!
                            (unless you plan to run this processor
                                                    under TSO)

               NOSPL requires that the input file have the ddname
               of INPUT.

               To use NOSPL for SMP SYSPRINT you will have to code
               a DCB of RECFM=FBA,LRECL=121,BLKSIZE=1210 on the
               SMP SYSPRINT DD card if it is pointed to tape or
               dasd. - This is for NOSPL only...... Do not code
               a DCB on your SMP SYSPRINT unless this is your
               output WTR .

               RECFM=FBM will be honored for FICHE and BAL output

.subsection 'Parms'

  Parms      : The controlling parms are

               CLASS=x where x is the output class(s) which are
                       held for this job which you wish this program
                       to process.
                       Abbreviation: C=x
               REQ=y   where y is the output class which your
                       output will be reque'd to.
                       It will also be rerouted to local  **
                       abbreviation: R=y
               MSVGP=zzzz  where zzzz is the MSVGP name where
                       the BAL listings will be placed.
                       Abbreviation: M=zzzz
               VOL=volser  the volser for output if not MSVGP for
                       the BAL listings will be placed.
                       Abbreviation: V=volser
               UNIT=unit   the device type of the volser
                       abbreviation: U=unit
               PREFIX=aaaa where aaaa is the PREFIX for the
                       data-sets when they are allocated on MSS.
                       Abbreviation: P=prefix
               JOBID = xxxx where xxxx is the jes job number
                       abbreviation: J=xxxx
                       if xxxx = 0 then no JOBID will be used
               DEBUG   turn on the DEBUG option - snaps all over
               SUBMIT  submit a job thru the internal reader to
                       execute program PRNTMODS to print the disk
                       data set. (must have MSVGP or VOL coded)
               FICHE    generate FICHE             (AUTOCOM II)
               WTR = unique name (i.E. Your name) this is used
                     as the output writer name on your SYSOUT
                     DD.  Ex.  SYSOUT=(A,LIONEL)
                 *** required for batch mode ***
                       abbreviation: W=name
               NOSPL    INPUT is from INPUT DD not spool
                     - if coded WTR & JOBID are ignored
               BAL1= xxxxx  where xxxxx is the name of the assembly
                     to begin printing from
                       abbreviation: B1=xxxx
               BAL2= yyyyy  where yyyyy is the name of the assembly
                     to stop  printing at
                       abbreviation: B2=yyyy

.subsection 'DD statements'

               OTHER    - all output other than the assembly listings.
               COPY     - a complete copy of the spooled INPUT
               REPORT   - a report of what processing has been done
               SYSPRINT - required for use by IDCAMS
               INTRDR   - optional (for option SUBMIT)
               INPUT    - NOSPL option point to sequential INPUT
                          and the spool will not be accessed.
