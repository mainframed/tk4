.subsection 'Description'
.sp
  This sub-program intercepts any 'STOP' or 'MODIFY' commands entered by
  the console operator and communicates with the caller via a reply
  buffer (data content).

  Invocation should be via the COBOL 'CALL' verb or Assembler BALR the
  parameter list is the address of an 80 byte reply area.

  The user must periodically call this sub-routine and then check the
  reply area for any communications from the operator.  The reply area
  must be cleared prior to calling this routine.

  The word 'STOP' must be used to shutdown your program because the
  'COMMTASK' subroutine will convert the 'P xxxx' to a 'STOP' in the
  reply area.

  'F xxxx,STOP' is the same as 'P xxxx'
