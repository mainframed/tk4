         DSDUMP will dump records of any data set that can be read by
         QSAM in a format similar to ABDUMP (8 hex words and 32 bytes of
         EBCDIC per line).  Selected records may be specified to reduce
         output.



         Input -

               DDNAME SYSUT1 Points to data set dumped.

               DDNAME SYSIN If present points to 80 char control cards
               of which only cols 1-72 are used.  If SYSIN is absent the
               entire data set is dumped.  Each control statement
               contains 1-5 positional parms which may start in any
               column.  Each parm is delimited by commas and the last
               indicated by a blank.  A parm may be in 3 formats.  Ddd
               for a decimal value, * to use current value, or x'0A' for
               a hex value (quotes optional).

               Parm field 1 = starting record
               Parm field 2 = number of records
               Parm field 3 = increment between records
               Parm field 4 = number of bytes dumped
               Parm field 5 = record displacement for 1st byte dumped
                              (if greater than record length request
                               will be terminated)


         Execute parms -

               CONSOLE      - use console input instead of SYSIN for
                              started jobs.
               DEBUG        - dump SYSUT1 DCB, deb, UCB, IOB,
                              amd ICB before 1st read and after
                              record read.
               LINECNT=ddd    lines per page 10-999 (default 43).
               BLKSIZE=ddd    forced SYSUT1 BLKSIZE 32-32767.
                              BLKSIZE Greater than device max is
                              ignored.

         Output -

               A prompt msg is issued if SYSIN is from a TSO terminal
               or the console.

               DDNAME SYSPRINT Is used for displaying dumped records


         Return codes -

               0  Normal return
               4
               8  Bad parms
              12
              16  No SYSUT1 DD statment
              20  no SYSPRINT DD statment
