     LOCINDEX



     1.0  General Description

     This subroutine is used to return dsnames and the volser
     for a specified INDEX structure.  The INDEX structure can be
     specified as several high-level qualifiers or it can be a
     dsname containing one embedded asterisk not as the high-level
     qualifier.





     2.0  Parameter list and return code description

     The parameter list is a four or five word list containing the
     following:

      Word         description

        1          Address of the 44-byte field containing the
                   INDEX structure.
        2          Address of the 44-byte field into which
                   LOCINDEX will place the dsname.
        3          Address of the 6-byte field into which
                   LOCINDEX will place the volser of the dataset.
        4          Address of a 4k work area to be used by
                   LOCINDEX for storing catalog blocks.
        5          Optional field for the address of a fullword
                   of storage on an integral boundary into which
                   LOCINDEX will store the return code.

     The high order bit of the last word of the parameter list
     must be set on.

      Return code  meaning

           0       A dsname was found and the dataset resides on
                   a disk volume.
           4       The INDEX structure was not found.
           8       A dsname was found and the dataset resides on
                   a tape volume.
          12       A dsname was found but it resides on multiple
                   volumes.
          16       There are no more datasets for this INDEX
                   structure.
          20       An I/O error was detected on the catalog.
          24       Error was detected in SVC26 whose cause could
                   not be determined. Notify systems programmer.


         Some Cautions on using this subroutine:

               1) The part above the asterisk is passed to VSAM
                  generic locate and works however generic locate
                  locate works. Only non-VSAM datasets are passed
                  back to the caller.
               2) The characters below the asterisk must appear
                  in the dataset name anywhere after the search
                  key characters. They may contain leading
                  and trailing partial INDEX levels.
               3) The amount of storage required for a VSAM generic
                  locate is much more than the 4k area provided by
                  the os caller. A 64k area is getmained and its
                  address is stored in the first work of the 4k
                  caller work area. It is freemained when the
                  return code of 16 signals the end of datasets
                  under this INDEX.
               5) The 265 byte camlist work area is put in the
                  caller provided work area at offset 4. This
                  allows access to the complete volume list.
