.subsection 'Purpose'

           To provide a means of setting a 3278-M4/M5 screen size to
            24x80 for a time and then resetting it back to whatever
            it was.

.subsection 'Operation'

             SETSCRN Uses the UPTUSER field for saving and restoring
              the screen size.  If this is not a tube, nothing is
              done.  If this is a tube and the UPTUSER field is
              hex zeros, then the current screen size is saved.  If
              it is not zeros, the screen size is restored and the
              UPTUSER field is reset to hex zeros.
