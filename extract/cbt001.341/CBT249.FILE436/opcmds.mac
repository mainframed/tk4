.subsection 'TAPEMARK'
.ix 'Test Commands' TAPEMARK
.sp
               THIS ROUTINE WILL WRITE 2 TAPEMARKS ON ANY TAPE
               DRIVE THAT IS NOT ALLOCATED WHEN SPECIFIED BY
               OPERATOR COMMAND.  IF THE DEVICE IS ALLOCATED FORCE
               MAY BE SPECIFIED TO IGNORE THE DEVICE BEING ALLOCATED.
               IF THE TAPE IS AT LOAD POINT AND THE DEVICE IS DUAL
               DENSITY LOW OR HIGH MAY BE SPECIFIED TO GET THE
               DESIRED DENSITY (IF MISSING HIGH IS ASSUMED FOR 9TR).
               THE DENSITY MUST BE SPECIFIED FOR 7 TRACK TAPES.
               ANY CURRENT STIMER WILL BE SAVED THEN RESTORED.
               A 1 SECOND STIMER WILL BE USED DURING WRITING TAPEMARKS.
               IF TIME EXPIRES THE TAPEMARK I/O WILL BE PURGED.
               ALL I/O BLOCKS WILL BE BUILT IN LSQA.  EXCP IS USED
               WITH ERROR RECOVERY DISABLED.  THE SENSE DATA WILL BE
               DISPLAYED IF ERROR IS OTHER THAN NOT READY OR FILE
               PROTECT.  THE DENSITY WILL BE DISPLAYED IF A 9 TRACK
               TAPE IS AT LOAD POINT OR THE TAPE IS 7 TRACK.
