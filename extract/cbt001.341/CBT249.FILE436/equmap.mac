.subsection 'Default Operation'

                Will list VTOC of all volumes except those allocated
                to the step or session(if in TSO foreground) with the
                ddname as follows:  SYS*
                                    STEPLIB
                                    JOBLIB

.subsection 'Parameters and Values'

                MAP - gives CCHH order map
                DUMP - will give hex print of DSCBs
                PDSLIST - will cause pgm PDSLIST to be called which
                      will list members of Partitioned Data Sets
                  SORT - may be added as a subparameter to be passed
                      to PDSLIST.  The format would be as follows:
                            PARM='PDSLIST,SORT'
                      This subparameter will cause the member listing
                      to be sorted in EBCDIC collating sequence.
                MAPDISK - special hardware map used by John Craig
                NOLOC - will ignore the LOCATE macro and saves time by
                      as much as 75%.  Only appropriate when ???
                NOTALLDD - will cause the program to confine itself to
                      listing only those volumes on dd statements whose
                      ddname begins with EQ.
