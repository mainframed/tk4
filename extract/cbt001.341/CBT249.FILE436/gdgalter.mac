This utility will read a GDG index structure and change the number
of entries defined by uncataloging all entries under the structure,
deleting the index structure, rebuilding the index structure, and
recataloging the necessary number of entries under the rebuilt
index.  If the new index contains less entries than the previous
index and there are generations left over after the re-cataloging,
the remaining generations are scratched if they reside on a DASD
device.
.pp
This utility will also list the GDG index structure, the entries
catalogued under the index, or with the PARM=LISTONLY - list a
series of indicies on a single page.

Sample JCL:
