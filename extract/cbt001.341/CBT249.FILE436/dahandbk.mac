     This program is designed to generate a data area handbook similiar
to the MVS Debugging Handbooks.  The input is the assembled machine
readable listing.

.subsection 'Parm'
.sp
     The L=xx parameter is optional and if coded must be first.  It
specifies the number of lines per page.  xx must be 2 numbers.
.sp
     The title consists of up to 45 characters to be used on the title
page and on the bottom of each page to identify the contents of the
handbook (i.e. PARM='JES3 SP 1.3.1 PUT 8209').
.sp
      The defaults are 'L=45,Data Area Handbook'

          1.  The table of contents is built from the listing using
              either the label of the macro for the name or if blank
              then the macro itself with the first 40 bytes of data
              is used.

          2.  The mapping of the macro will list all dc's with the
              first 16 bytes of the value.  All equates will have the
              value displayed in hex immediately following the prior
              dc which is assumed to be the flag byte.

          3.  After the mapping a cross-reference is performed in
              alpha-numeric order.
