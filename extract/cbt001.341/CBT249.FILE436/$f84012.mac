This flash is to document some of the changes to the OS&T system
since the publication of OS&T Manual Version 4.
.pp
These changes are:
.point begin
A new option has been added to the  IBM Menu to process the Data Set and
Free Space Manager IUP.
.point
An ISPF dialog is now available from the AOST menu, option 22, to
change your ACF2 password in up to 6 centers.  The dialog creates and
submits batch jobs thru NJE to change the ACF2 password.
.point
A CHANGE NOTICE dialog is available via the AOST menu, option 21.
This dialog will maintain an ISPF table for each change notice
group and will assign the next change notice number based upon the
last number assigned from the table.  The change notice will then
be printed on the Xerox 2700.
.point 2
If you wish to utilize this facility please contact me on Comnet
374-1125 and I will provide additional information that will be needed
to utilize this facility.
.point 1
The SYSREPRO and PRINTOFF programs which are available in the AOST
system have been placed into production and are available via the
standard linklist search in WCC1, WCC2 and SWC2.
.point
The Xerox 2700 (RM102) has been upgraded to a model 2.  This means that
you can now provide twice as many control cards to the 2700 as before.
There is also a new font available, the Titan10iso-P, portrait font.
.point
Both the Xerox 2700 and the Xerox 9700 applications have been updated
to prompt you with a member name list if you request that a PDS
be printed and do not supply a member name.  Each member to be printed
is then selected by specifying any non-blank character in the selection
column of the menu.
.point
A new ISPF program is available to generate a jobcard for use in
file tailoring.  The program is RJOBCARD.  It will create an ISPF
variable RJCARD1 which will contain a complete 80 byte job card
complete with a jobname of userid.suffix, where suffix is incremented
from A thru Z and 0 thru 9 each time the program is invoked.
.point end

Remember you can use the FEEDBACK facility on the AOST ISPF Master
Application Menu.
