  Description:  This program formats information on any disk data
      set.  It reads through the entire data set and outputs disk
      track usage, record sizes, counts and other statistics.

      In addition, several data set validity checks are performed
      during input processing to insure that the data set will be
      usable by the system for non-excp processing.

      If any errors are encountered, the return code is set to 4095
      (or the program abends); otherwise, the return code is set
      to the minimum of 4094 and the number of tracks which should
      compress out for partitioned data sets.



  Definitions (for partitioned data sets):

      A.  Real member - a non-alias member name which is present in
          the directory.

      B.  Gas member - a member of a partitioned data set which has
          been replaced or deleted from the data set.  A gas member
          does not have an entry in the directory pointing to it;
          disk storage occupied by gas members is made usable for
          other members by an IEBCOPY compress operation.

          Note: gas members can be resurrected by the TSO SPDS command
          if it is given the beginning TTR address and a member name.



  Program parm (only the first parm character is significant;
                at most one of the following may be specified):

      A.  Labelonly  - label information is to be formatted but no
                       data set reads are to be performed (except
                       the read for any ISAM format 2 DSCB).

      B.  Nogas      - no gas member report is to be provided for
                       partitioned data sets.

      C.  Errorsonly - only error messages are to be output.

      D.  Allextents - all extents of the data set are to be read
                       regardless of the ds1lstar setting.

  Operation:

      A.  The program performs a RDJFCB to get the dsname and volume
          name; an obtain to get the format 1 DSCB; a DEVTYPE to get
          the device characteristics; and an open to initialize the
          data set's data extent block (DEB) information.

      B.  The program formats and outputs DEB and DSCB information.

      C.  The program then reads through the data set and outputs
          disk track usage, record sizes, counts and other statistics.

      D.  Additional processing:

          1. For physical sequential, direct or VSAM data sets, no
             additional processing is performed.

          2. For ISAM data sets, the program reads through the
             entire data set (there may be several files of data)
             and reports on each file.  Also, the program inputs
             the ISAM label (format two DSCB) record and provides
             a data set profile which includes data set
             reorganization data and data set characteristics.

          3. For partitioned data sets, if the data set name and a
             member name is allocated to the input data set, the
             member is processed like a sequential data set.

          4. For other partitioned data sets, the program compares
             directory TTR's against actual disk addresses to
             provide a report by gas member:
             a.  For load libraries, the linkage-edit date and the
                 names of the first few csects are provided.
             B.  For other libraries, the first 79 characters of
                 each gas member is output.
             Statistics are maintained on the size of gas and real
             members and the number of alias members.  DSTATS checks
             for aliases which have no real entries and apparent
             aliases (two real members with the same TTR).

    Change section:

      Version 1.0: DSTATS was written for a UCLA programming class

      Version 1.1: Modified to allow 3000 members (instead of 1000)

      Version 2.0: Added more statistics:

        A.  Added the allextents and errorsonly parm controls

        B.  Added VSAM support

        C.  Added record size distribution outputs

        D.  Added LRECL statistics and validity checks.

        E.  Added creation, expiration and last use dates.

        F.  Supported disk devices: 2305-1, 2305-2, 2314,
            3330, 3330-1, 3340, 3350, 3375 and 3380.

        G.  Added more information for I/O and other error conditions.

        H.  Added support for track overflow data sets.

        I.  Unprintable characters (for a 3270-type device) in the
            output are translated to periods.


        J.  Made the following changes for partitioned data sets:

            1.  Added gas module linkage-edit date and csect names

            2.  Fixed a bug: the reported TTR of gas members was
                sometimes incorrect (a track switch check was missed).

            3.  Enhanced the compress algorithm: instead of esti-
                mating potential free tracks from (total gas size)/
                (average bytes on a track); a compress is now simu-
                lated.  The former calculation worked well only for
                libraries with blocksizes which did not vary.

            4.  Added directory block statistics.

            5.  Added a check for apparent alias members (two real
                members with the same TTR).

            6.  Added real and gas member total byte counts.

            7.  The member table is now dynamically allocated; its
                size is doubled each time it is exceeded.
