.subsection 'Description'
.sp
  This program is designed to convert a text file of fixed length
  Records up to lrecl 150 from all upper case into a upper and
  Lower case text file.  The program will recognize the first letter
  Of each sentence as well as assume that the first letter of the
  First sentence after a blank line and convert it to upper case.
  It will also recognize the word I.

  To provide the user with flexibility the program has two special
  Input files to allow the user to specify words requiring all caps
  And those words where just the first letter is to be capped.

.subsection 'JCL'

  The JCL to execute LOWERCSE are:

        //STEPLOW EXEC PGM=LOWERCSE
        //UPPERIN  DD DSN= UPPER CASE INPUT FILE
        //LOWEROUT DD DSN= UPPER AND LOWER OUTPUT FILE
        //CAPSIN   DD *
         Words where the first letter will be capped seperated by
         Blanks or commas.
        //WORDIN   DD *
         Words where all the letters wil be capped seperated by
         Blanks or commas.

  There are 2 user abend codes:  1000 means that the all caps word
                                 Table is full.  You will have to
                                 Re-assemble after changing the table
                                 Size at label wordtbls.

                                 2000 Means that the first cap word
                                 Table filled up and you will have
                                 To change it at label capstbls.

  Note: The word table has room for 500 entries.
        The caps table has room for 300 entries.
