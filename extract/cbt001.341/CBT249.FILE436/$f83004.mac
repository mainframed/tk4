-----------------------------------------------------------------------
This AOST Flash reflects changes and/or enhancements to the OS&T system.
These changes will be reflected in the next release of the OS&T Manual.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Theses updates may be filed at the beginning of the OS & T, or the end
for reference until a new release of the manual is published.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Included in this Flash are:

An enhancement to entering the AOST ISPF Panels using a new clist once
the PREISPF clist has been executed to allocate the required ISPF
libraries.  This clist may be invoked by entering %AOST.  It will
determine which ISPF is active based upon the allocation status of the
ISPPROF file and then issue either ISPSTART or ISPF PANEL(ISP@MSTR).

As many of you are aware we are testing a new printer from Xerox called
the Xerox 2700.  This is a 12 page per minute laser printer which may
be used for upto 2000 lines of output.  If you attempt to print more
your output will wait in the JES3 Q until the operator either cancels
or reroutes your output.

To simplify the use and testing of the Xerox 2700, I have created an
ISPF Panel similar to the Xerox 9700 panel to send output to the 2700.

The output is sent direct from TSO instead of going thru batch as the
Xerox 9700 does.  Once your output is printed you should go to the
printer and remove your output.  The printer is located in the resource
room on the 8th floor next to the library.

I have included the updated AOST ISPF Chapters and copies of the Xerox
2700 Panels for your convenience.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Please forward any comments, suggestions and/or additions for the OS & T
manual, ISPF panels or libraries to me.
