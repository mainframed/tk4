.subsection 'Introduction'
The SLAC modifications to the  IBM Program Product H-Level Assembler
are of three kinds:
 ø Changes that do not affect  the programming language,  but enhance
   the capabilities and usability of the Assembler;
 ø Changes to the macro and conditional assembly language; and
 ø Changes to the assembly ("open-code") language.
.subsection 'Changes to the Assembler'
.ix 'Assembler H' 'Changes'
.subsub 'Changes to Printed Output'
    ø The heading at the top of each page contains the identification
      "(SLAC V2.7)".
    ø A  subset of  the  IEV9xx error  messages  that  appear in  the
      SYSPRINT data set now will also  appear in the SYSTERM data set
      (e.g., no core left, i/o error...).
    ø The default number of lines in  SYSTERM for a no-error assembly
      is now 2.  The "ASSEMBLER DONE" and the "NO STATEMENTS FLAGGED"
      are still printed, and the rest are suppressed.
    ø The DECKID (the  name field from the first title  card)  is now
      also printed in  SYSTERM.   This is helpful if you  have done a
      batched assembly and are trying  to determine which assembly is
      responsible for an error message.
    ø MACRO/Copy Code Source Cross-Reference.   This is a list of the
      SYSLIB data set names (in search  order),  and a listing of the
      macros and copy code that were used from each.   The MACRO/Copy
      Code  Source  Cross-Reference  is  under  the  control  of  the
      [NO]MSRC parameter.   MSRC  (the default)  will allow  it to be
      produced.
    ø DSECT  Cross-Reference.   Directly after  the  MACRO/Copy  Code
      Source,   if NODXREF  is  not specified  (i.e.,   DXREF is  the
      default),  a listing of the DSECTs in the assembly is produced.
      For each DSECT, its name, length (in bytes),  and the statement
      number where it is defined are given.
    ø At the  top of each  page,  the  current active USINGs  are now
      printed on up to two subtitle lines.   These USINGs are current
      as of the end of assembly of  the last instruction on the prior
      page.  These lines are under the control of the [NO]UMAP param-
      eter.  UMAP (the default) will cause the USINGs to be printed.
    ø The second  heading line  on each page  of the  actual assembly
      listing (the  line with 'LOC  OBJECT ADDR1 ADDR2')   will start
      with 'D-LOC' if IBMOUT is not in  effect and at the time of the
      page eject the assembly was in a DSECT.
    ø The IBM implementation  of SYSTERM has been  entirely replaced.
      The new SYSTERM, for errors in macro-generated code,  will only
      print the macro call once.  After printing any individual macro
      call, it will only print the statement in error and its associ-
      ated error messages, rather than all the statements between the
      call to the error.   The format for  SYSTERM is now the same as
      that for SYSPRINT (i.e.,  it's not  all rearranged like the old
      SYSTERM).
    ø At the end of each assembly listing, the number of utility file
      (SYSUT1) reads and writes are displayed,  along with the SYSIN,
      SYSPRINT and SYSLIB counts which were displayed before.
.subsub 'Changes to Error Messages and Severities'
.ix 'Assembler H' 'Error Messages'
    ø A new error test and diagnostic message have been added:
         IEV056 - USING RENDERED NULL BY A PRIOR ACTIVE USING
      Given  the  rules  governing  base-displacement  resolution  of
      implied addresses (choose the register giving the smallest dis-
      placement,  and the highest-numbered such register),  this mes-
      sage will be issued if it is  found that a prior active USING's
      range  overlaps and  supersedes that  of the  USING being  pro-
      cessed.  The severity level of this error is 4.
    ø The  error  message "IEV044  -  SYMBOL  NOT DEFINED"  has  been
      extended so that  it now will tell you which  symbol is thought
      to be undefined.
    ø A misquoted operand  on a TITLE card  now will only earn  you a
      level 4 error.
.subsub 'Changes To Input and Output Handling'
    ø ASMH will now  accept WYLBUR pressed format  (with RECFM=U)  as
      input for both SYSIN and SYSLIB.   The concatenations of SYSLIB
      may be  either RECFM=FB or RECFM=U,   or a mixture of  the two.
      Another change to  SYSLIB processing is that the  data set with
      the largest block  size need not be first in  the SYSLIB conca-
      tenation sequence.
    ø An exit  is available just before  each line is  printed.   The
      exit routine name  is specified by 'PEXIT=XXXX'  in the invoca-
      tion PARM string.   XXXX is the module name of the exit routine
      in the PDS  pointed to by the EXITLIB DD  statement.   The exit
      routine is called using standard  OS linkage conventions.   The
      parameter address list whose address is passed in R1 is:
                 A(the line to be printed)
                 A(the SYSPRINT DCB)
                 A(OCTL values)
                 A(line type flag byte)
    The first two are self-explanatory.   The OCTL values,  4 succes-
    sive halfwords,  will be described  below in the section "Changes
    to the Assembly  Language."  The line type flag is  a single byte
    whose bits are defined as:
           '80' - This line is part of the 3-line title
                  field at the top of each page.
           '40' - This line is a machine instruction line.
           '20' - This line is a DC/DS line.
           '10' - This line is part of the symbol table
                  cross-reference.
           '08' - This line is part of the post-assembly
                  messages.
           '04' - This line is part of the pre-assembly
           '02' - SYSPRINT DCB open exit entry (occurs just before
                  the exit returns to finish the open).
           '01' - This line is the first output line of
                  this assembly.
      (Note:  For the  open-exit call,  only the DCB  address and the
      flag  byte address  are defined;   any nonzero  return code  is
      equivalent to 20.)
      When the  exit routine returns  control to the  Assembler,  R15
      must contain  a return  code.   If  an invalid  return code  is
      returned, the exit will be turned off (i.e., never called again
      for this assembly).  The valid return codes are:
              0 - print the line in the buffer
              4 - don't print the line in the buffer
              8 - print the line and return back to the
                  exit with an empty buffer
             12 - don't print the line and return with
                  an empty buffer
             16 - final return for this line
             20 - kill the exit (i.e., don't call again
                  for this assembly)
    ø The LRECL  of the SYSPRINT DCB  has been unhardwired  from 121.
      This allows you  to specify any value greater than  or equal to
      121.   (If the LRECL specified is less  than 121 it will be set
      to 121.)   If you do specify a value larger than 121,  only the
      first 121 bytes of each print  buffer will be properly blanked.
      It's up to you to blank or clear anything beyond 121.
    ø The DD name for the object deck  output data set for the Loader
      or Linkage Editor is now determined in  much the same way as in
      ASMG.  The ASMH default DD name, SYSGO, can be overridden by an
      alternate DD name list.  This name is searched for in the TIOT;
      if it is found,  it will be used as the DD name.   If not,  the
      TIOT is searched for SYSGO or SYSLIN.   If either is there, the
      one found will be used.  If both are there, SYSGO will be used.
      If neither is there,  the DD name in the DCB will be left as is
      and processing  will continue as  in the original  ASMH.   (The
      above does not apply to ASMH under CMS).
    ø SYM cards are  now produced for equates whose  first operand is
      relocatable and the LOCTR for that  operand is the current one.
      The format is the same as that generated by ASMF.
    ø For any part  of ASMH's input that  is a WYLBUR edit  data set,
      one now  has a choice of  formats of the sequence  field.   The
      invocation  parameter  INTEGER,   the default,   will  yield  a
      sequence  field  of  8  decimal  digits  (Fortran  I8  format).
      DECIMAL,  the other  choice,  will yield a sequence  field of 4
      digits, a period, and 3 more digits (Fortran F8.3 format).
      The input WYLBUR line number 234.567 will yield "00234567" with
      INTEGER,  and  "234.567" with DECIMAL.   Note that an  input of
      "87654.321" with  the DECIMAL  option yields:   "7654.321" (the
      sequence field only has room for 8 characters).
    ø The FOLD parameter causes ASMH to  treat all lower case charac-
      ters as their upper case counterparts.  NOFOLD is the default.
.subsub 'Changes to Parameters'
.ix 'Assembler H' 'Added Parmeters'
    ø If you  specify the REL2  invocation parameter (a  new option),
      2-byte A-type relocatable constants are allowed,  as in AL2(*).
      Y-type constants must still have absolute operands; only A-type
      constants are affected by the REL2 parameter in this version of
      ASMH.
    ø The  default for  the  RLD/NORLD  invocation parameter  is  now
      NORLD.
    ø The SYSPRINT exit parameter PEXIT=XXXX  is described above,  in
      the discussion of changes to input and output handling.
    ø The Assembler can now run  entirely in memory,  without SYSUT1.
      By specifying  NODISK,  the  Assembler will  ignore SYSUT1  and
      attempt to run entirely with  internal buffering of information
      that normally would be spilled to disk.   If there isn't enough
      memory for the assembly to be done this way,  it will be termi-
      nated with a level 20 return code and a message.
      At the end  of each assembly,  the Assembler will  tell you how
      much memory was allocated to buffers  and what it determines it
      would  need to  do the  assembly completely  in memory.    This
      information  is provided  even when  you are  not running  with
      NODISK (i.e., DISK).
    ø Two  invocation parameters  have been  added  to control  PRINT
      statements that appear within an assembly source.  PRINTGEN, if
      specified, will nullify any PRINT NOGENs embedded within a pro-
      gram source.  PRINTON does similarly, overriding PRINT OFFs.
    ø The invocation parameter OPCNTS will cause the opcode table and
      the opcode  usage counts  to be  displayed at  the end  of each
      assembly.  The usage count displayed is the number of times the
      opcode was searched for in the opcode table.
      Within the  Assembler,  the  opcodes are hashed  onto a  set of
      chains.   For the  OPCNTS display,  the beginning  of each such
      chain is flagged by a "×".
    ø The IBMOUT  parameter requires the Assembler's  SYSPRINT output
      to be similar to that of  the unmodified ASMH.   At the current
      time,  IBMOUT really means NOUMAP,  NOMSRC and NODXREF.   If in
      the future there are other options  that would change the list-
      ing format, IBMOUT will reset them also.
    ø The parameters  INTEGER/DECIMAL and  FOLD/NOFOLD are  described
      above,  in the  discussion of changes to input  and output han-
      dling.
    ø The OLDTYPE invocation parameter is described below in the dis-
      cussion of changes to the macro language.
.subsection 'Changes to the Macro Language'
 ø Six new system variable symbols have been defined:
    (1) &SYSSTYP  -  a  character variable  containing  the  location
        counter type ('CSECT'  or 'DSECT')  at the  invocation of the
        current macro.  (This definition is the same as in ASMG.)
    (2,3) &SYSJOB, &SYSSTEP - both are character variables.   For OS,
        they return the job name and the rightmost non-blank stepname
        in the TIOT.    For CMS,  they return 'NO JOB'  and 'NO STEP'
        respectively.
    (4) &SYSNEST - an arithmetic type  variable that returns the cur-
        rent macro  nesting level.   Level 0  is defined as  the open
        code level.    (The use of  &SYSNEST makes  writing recursive
        macros not only easier but much safer.  A recursive macro now
        has a way of telling how "deep  in the weeds" it is,  and can
        do something about it.)
    (5) &SYSMDSN - a character variable giving the source of the cur-
        rent macro.  The variable is 50 bytes long and is always pad-
        ded with  blanks on the right.    The first 6 bytes  give the
        volume serial on which the macro was found, and the following
        44 bytes are the data set name.   For CMS,  the DSN is only 8
        bytes long and is the file name.
    (6) &SYSSTMT - an eight-byte character variable that contains the
        statement number of the next statement to be generated.   The
        variable is always eight characters and is padded on the left
        with  zeros.   (The  significant digits  can  be obtained  by
        assigning &SYSSTMT to an arithmetic-type variable.)
 ø MACRO call statement  name fields need not contain  a valid Assem-
   bler symbol.  If you desire to put a number, any string without an
   embedded blank,  or any quoted string in the name field,  no error
   messages will be generated.
 ø There are  2 valid operands on  the AREAD statement that  were not
   documented by IBM:  CLOCKB and CLOCKD.   They return the result of
   a TIME BIN and TIME DEC (in the OS sense) respectively.
 ø The type attribute (T')  of a parenthesized expression like "(10)"
   is no longer 'N'.   It is set to 'U' like it should be.   The only
   thing that has  type attribute 'N' is a  truly self-defining term.
   (Try  generating DC  H'10E(10)' from  within a  macro because  the
   Assembler "told" you that the T'  of "(10)" was 'N'.   (For anyone
   that may need the old definition,  there is the OLDTYPE invocation
   parameter.)
 ø In LCLx/GBLx  statements,  the  "&" preceding  the variable  names
   being declared is no longer required.  The absence of the "&" will
   cause a level 0 warning message to be generated.  This can be sup-
   pressed by running ASMH with FLAG set to greater than 0.
 ø The macro language has 2 new  opcodes:   ASPACE and AEJECT.   They
   provide services analogous  to SPACE and EJECT,  but  only for the
   listing of in-line macro source code.  ASPACE, unlike its assembly
   time counterpart,   allows only an  unsigned decimal integer  as a
   possible operand.  AEJECT, like EJECT, neither requires nor allows
   an operand.
.subsection 'Changes to the Assembly Language'
 ø The <NO>MSOURCE operand  may be specified on  the PRINT statement.
   If PRINT  NOMSOURCE and PRINT  GEN are  both in effect,   the body
   (columns 1  - 71)  of each  macro-generated statement will  not be
   printed.   If you write code rich in macro calls, it's nice to see
   the addresses and  the generated code on the left  of the listing,
   but the body  of each statement can be  fairly meaningless;  hence
   you may not want it printed.
 ø The underscore (_)  has been added  to the list of characters that
   ASMH allows in symbols.  It is treated the same as a numeric digit
   as far as where it may and may not appear in symbols and in opera-
   tion codes and macro names.   The  common use is to separate words
   in labels or identifiers (don't forget, ASMH allows identifiers of
   up to 63 characters).
 ø A new  machine instruction  operation code has  been added  for VM
   users - DIAG  (DIAGNOSE).  DIAG is treated as  an RS-type instruc-
   tion:
             DIAG   r1,r3,d2(b2)
 ø The Assembler instruction statement opcode  OCTL provides a way of
   passing  parameters to  the  print exit.    There  are 4  operands
   allowed on  an OCTL statement,  each  of which must evaluate  to a
   16-bit absolute expression.   These are evaluated and put into the
   corresponding halfwords of the OCTL values passed to the exit rou-
   tine designated by  the PEXIT parameter.   Each operand  may be of
   three forms:   an absolute expression;   an expression of the form
   *’N (where * is taken to be  the current value for that OCTL posi-
   tion to which  N is either added or subtracted);   or null,  which
   means leave the current value as is.   Note:  The Assembler places
   no meaning  on the operand values;   it simply evaluates  them and
   passes them to the print exit.   For a missing (null) operand, the
   value that was there before is left untouched.
 ø A new operand, NOPRINT, has been added to the PUSH, POP, and PRINT
   pseudo instructions.   If you specify 'NOPRINT' the statement will
   not be printed, as you would expect.
 ø Qualified USINGs (or, more properly,  Labeled USINGs and Qualified
   Symbols),   are a  major new  capability of  ASMH,  allowing  much
   greater control over  the resolution of symbolic  expressions into
   base-displacement form with specific base registers.
   The mechanics of this facility are  rather simple.   First,  put a
   label on  a USING  statement.   Then,  to  force the  Assembler to
   resolve a symbol  into base-displacement form through  that USING,
   qualify the  symbol by preceding it  with the label on  the USING,
   followed by a period.   An example of Labeled USINGs and Qualified
   Symbols would be:
   PRIOR   USING   IHADCB,R10
   NEXT    USING   IHADCB,R2
           MVC     PRIOR.DCBLRECL,NEXT.DCBLRECL
   Without labeled USINGs,  this would have to be written in the awk-
   ward and inelegant form:
           USING   IHADCB,R10
           MVC     DCBLRECL,DCBLRECL-IHADCB(R2)
            or
           MVC     DCBLRECL-IHADCB(,R10),DCBLRECL-IHADCB(R2)
   Another example of the use of labeled USINGs is:
   X       CSECT
           USING   X,R10,R11
           .
           .
   SYSUT2  USING   IHADCB-(DCBUT2-X),R10,R11
           LH      R0,SYSUT2.DCBBLKSI
           .
           .
   DCBUT2  DCB     DDNAME=SYSUT2,...
   The usual  way of symbolically  referencing parts  of a DCB  is to
   load the address of the DCB into Rn followed by "USING IHADCB,Rn".
   Such a  technique requires  you to allocate  an extra  register to
   hold the address of the DCB.  With labeled USINGs, you are able to
   utilize already allocated registers (in  this case,  the program's
   base registers).   This technique works  because the two USINGs do
   not interfere with each other,  even  though they specify the same
   registers; see below for details.
   The label on a USING may not appear in the name field of any other
   statements except that of other USINGs.    If a label appears on a
   USING, any other USING with the same label is nullified.
   As is the case with non-labeled USING statements, a symbol (in the
   first operand)  or  a register (in any of  the remaining operands)
   may appear in any number of USINGs.  However, in the case of qual-
   ified USINGs,  as long as all  the USINGs have unique labels,  all
   are considered active and are eligible to be used as qualifiers.
   There is a very basic concept about Labeled and non-Labeled USINGs
   that needs to be understood.    In non-Labeled USINGs,  a register
   implies data,   in the sense  that a  register may imply  only one
   piece of data at a time (i.e.,  when a register that appeared in a
   USING appears in another USING, the prior USING is nullified).  In
   Labeled USINGs the reverse is true:   the data implies a register.
   That is,   a single register may  appear in multiple  USINGs,  all
   being active, so long as all the USINGs have unique labels.  (Nul-
   lification of  Labeled USINGs  occurs only  when a  repeated Label
   appears, not when a repeated register appears.)
   Labeled USINGs do not interfere with non-labeled USINGs.  When the
   Assembler resolves an implied address into base-displacement form,
   either the expression to be resolved was qualified or not.   If it
   was, the specified labeled USING will be used.  If not, the active
   non-labeled USINGs will be scanned in the standard manner, looking
   for a resolution.
   A label on a USING defines an environment.  As such, when you want
   to nullify (delete)  that environment,  you must DROP the environ-
   ment's name,  the USING's label.   An attempt to nullify a labeled
   USING by  dropping its  registers will  result in  those registers
   being dropped instead from the non-labeled USING pool.   You would
   nullify the Labeled USINGs from the example above by writing:
          DROP   PRIOR,NEXT
 ø Ten new extended branch mnemonics have  been added to the existing
   set.   The new mnemonics are BGT, BGE, BEQ,  BLE,  BLT,  and their
   RR-type BCR counterparts BGTR, BGER, BEQR,  BLER,  and BLTR.   The
   corresponding branch mask digits are 2, 10, 8,  12,  and 4 respec-
   tively.
 ø Literals and  where they  may appear has  been made  slightly less
   restrictive.   For machine instructions (and only machine instruc-
   tions)   a literal  may appear  anywhere a  relocatable symbol  is
   valid.   The exception  to this is that the length  attribute of a
   literal is still undefined.  An example of this might be:
             LA   R1,=C'??'-24           get parm for ADT lookup
 ø AOPTION  - a  new opcode.   Given that  the invocation  parameters
   really only define  a default assembly environment,   AOPTION pro-
   vides a means to specify  a specific statement-by-statement assem-
   bly environment.    AOPTION may be used  as many times  as desired
   during an assembly whether batched or  not.   (TEST and NOTEST are
   currently the only valid operands.)
   Now,  at the end of each assembly,  all the ASMH options are reset
   to their invocation values.  This  means that an environment modi-
   fied through AOPTION will not affect the next assembly in a batch.
 ø The length attribute (L')  used on  a machine instruction within a
   macro definition now behaves the same as that of ASM-F.  (A state-
   ment such as:
           TM    &X,L'&X
   used to cause  the  Assembler to think that it had  the letter "L"
   followed by an improperly quoted string.)
 ø Both the scale attribute (S') and the integer attributes (I')  now
   may also be used in open code.  Both their definitions are identi-
   cal to those for use within macro definitions.
 ø Errors in the invocation parameters are diagnosed better.  Instead
   of getting a "There is an error  in the parm list" message (at the
   end of the assembly), the actual parms in error will be displayed.
   In an OS environment,  this display  will be sent both to SYSPRINT
   and to SYSTERM.   (Note: In CMS, SYSTERM is assigned to the termi-
   nal.)
   More important, as soon as the assembler recognizes that it has an
   erroneous parm,  a warning message and  the erroneous parm will be
   sent to the terminal.   (This way,   if the parm is critical,  the
   assembly can be aborted before wasting a lot of time.)
 ø Associated  USING  statements  provide   additional  control  over
   address expression resolution.  The format  of an Associated USING
   is:
   <label>   USING    S1,S2
   <label> if present, makes this a labeled Associated USING (see the
   discussion of  labeled USINGs above).  S1  is an expression  to be
   interpreted in the same way as in any other USING.  S2 is a second
   address expression specifying where S1 is to be based.
   An example of the use of an Associated USING might be:
   X       CSECT
           USING   X,R10,R11  NORMAL USING
           .
           .
           USING   IHADCB,DCBUT2        ASSOCIATED USING
           LH      R0,DCBBLKSI          USES R10 OR R11 FOR BASE
           .
           .
   DCBUT2  DCB     DDNAME=SYSUT2,...
   Note that this is another (simpler) solution to the problem solved
   in the second example in the description of Labeled USINGs.
   The difference between ordinary USINGs, Labeled USINGs,  and Asso-
   ciated USINGs is the following.    In ordinary situations,  a pro-
   grammer must assign several registers for addressing purposes, and
   provide USING  statements to allow  the Assembler to  make address
   resolution decisions.   Labeled and Associated USINGs allow you to
   restrict the  Assembler's decisions  and to  reduce the  number of
   registers needed for addressing.
   With ordinary USINGs,  a given  expression may be addressable with
   several registers;  Labeled USINGs provide qualifiers that let you
   specify exactly which USING is to  be used to resolve that expres-
   sion.   Thus,  Labeled USINGs can be viewed as a way to reduce the
   freedom with  which the  Assembler chooses  among the  "available"
   registers.
   Conversely,  Associated USINGs  allow you to reduce  the number of
   registers that  must be  assigned to  addressing,  but  allows the
   Assembler freedom to  choose the register.   If an  area of memory
   customarily mapped by one register  is addressed by another,  only
   the second  need be used for  address resolution;  the  mapping is
   specified in an Associated USING, as in the above example.
