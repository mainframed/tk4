.ix Programs COPYCNTL
.pp
This program is part of the source maintenance system and is designed
to copy a source/macro element from the designated library to a user
controlled library for modification.
.pp
Several functions are supported in COPYCNTL.
.point begin
COPY
.point 2
Copy an element and enter an entry in a control log file.  The user
is informed of the copy.  During this process the user is informed of
any other user who has copied the element and if a conflict exists is
informed of it.  If a conflict does exist the user must respond force
to a tput/tget sequence or the copy will not take place.
.point 1
FINISH
.point 2
This function will update the control log file indicating that the
user has completed this use of the element.  If the usermod id
supplied is not found to have been used in a copy then the element
is not marked finished and the user is informed.  This is to insure
the integrity of the log file.
.point 1
CANCEL
.point 2
This function is similiar to the FINISH function except it is used to
indicate that the modification the user was working on has been
cancelled.
.point end
.pp
During each of the above functions the OS ACT is accessed to acquire
the users name from the job card image maintained in the OS ACT.
