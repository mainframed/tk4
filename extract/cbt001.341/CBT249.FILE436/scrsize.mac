     This TSO command will pass a return code indicating the current
     terminal model so that a clist may check the terminal type.

     This is useful where a full screen application is sensitive to the
     terminal screen size.  For example INFO/MVS requires a mod 2 or 4
     to function properly.



   The return codes in register 15 are:

              2  =  3278-2
              3  =  3278-3
              4  =  3278-4
              5  =  3278-5
             99  =  UNKNOWN TERMINAL SIZE
