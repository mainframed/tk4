.pp
This program is designed to read an unloaded copy of the source
maintenance control log (unloaded by IEBPDSUT) and generate a
report listing all elements currently being worked on.
.pp
The logic is to read thru each member and find the active record and
then if the next record is not for the same usermod id then an anomaly
has occured and a line is output to sysprint.
