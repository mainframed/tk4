.pp
This program accepts system or JES2 operator commands as
input and executes them using SVC 34. It must be APF
authorized.
.pp
COMMAND can operate in one of three modes:
.sp
.point begin
Batch or CALLed program
.br
In this mode COMMAND accepts input as either 80-byte
card images from SYSIN or a single command from the PARM
field. The response to the operator command will
appear on all operator consoles. For example:
.sp
//STEP1    EXEC PGM=COMMAND,PARM='VARY 017,ONLINE'
.sp;.in +10
- or -
.in -10;.sp
//STEP1    EXEC PGM=COMMAND
//SYSIN    DD *
VARY 017,ONLINE
/*
.sp;.point
TSO Command Processor
.br
In this mode COMMAND expects to find the operator command
directly following on the TSO input line. The response to
OS commands will then be displayed on the TSO terminal.
Response to JES2 commands will appear on all consoles.
For example:
.sp;.in +10
COMMAND D T         <--- (Response will appear on CRT)
.sp;.in -10
.point
Callable subroutine
.br
In this mode COMMAND accepts input according to standard
OS linkage conventions. In addition to the command itself,
a second parameter may be passed which contains the
console number where you wish the response to appear.
(The SVC 34 will also assume the authority of that
console.) For example:
.sp;.in +10
LA       R1,CMDADDR
LA       R15,=V(COMMAND)
BALR     R14,R15
.sp
ADDR  DC    A(OPERCMD)
ADDR  DC    XL1'80',AL3(CONSOLE)
RCMD  DC    H(3),CL3'D T'
SOLE  DC    F'5'
.sp;.in -10
This would make it appear as if 'D T' were issued from
console 5.
.point
.us Notes:
Just prior to issuing a command via SVC 34, COMMAND will
issue a WTO of the form
.sp;.in +10
SCECMD01 - userid  - VARY 017,ONLINE
.sp;,in -10
This will appear on the operator's console and in SYSLOG.
.sp
COMMAND may be used to issue replies to WTORs. Since the
reply may be sensitive (for example, a password) COMMAND
will supress it whenever a REPLY is issued.
