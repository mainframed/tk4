There are 2 local user groups for MVS in the L.A. area.  The oldest
is the L.A. MVSUG which meets every 3rd Wednesday at Barones in North
Hollywood.  The fee is $7 and covers lunch and the meeting.  The newer
of the 2 is the Orange County MVSUG which meets the 1st Wednesday of
each month at the Velvet Turtle in Newport Beach, Fashion Island.  Their
fee is $10 for lunch and the meeting.

The format of each is the same.  The room opens at 11:30 for a time
of open discussion as everyone arrives.  This is followed by lunch.
After lunch there is a 1/2 hour or more of local 'business'.  Local
'business' is a time where experiences are shared, problems are aired as
a warning to others and requests for suggestions on how to resolve
problems are made.  After the local business there is a break followed
by a 1 hour presentation by IBM, another vendor or an installation about
a product or experience.  In the past there have been presentations on
DF/EF, MVS/XA, MVS/SP 1.3, PMO, VAM/SPF, 3081, etc.

The Los Angeles IMS User Group(LAIMSUG) meets once a month, usually
on the second Thursday of the month.  The meetings are free and are
hosted by user installations around the area and so move from month to
month.  The standard meeting begins at 1:30 and lasts all afternoon.
There is a presentation by a vendor or a user installation at 1:30 which
lasts until 3:00 and then a break.  Following the break the group
divides into systems programming and applications subgroups for general
roundtable discussions.  For some individuals these are the most useful
parts of the meetings since much problem resolution goes on then.
The hosting installation provides coffee and donuts or cookies.
To get ahold of a LAIMSUG calendar contact your local SE or Angie Bua.

There is also a DB/DC Data Dictionary Users Group which meets on
a monthly basis and a Data Administration Group which meets regularly
in this area.
