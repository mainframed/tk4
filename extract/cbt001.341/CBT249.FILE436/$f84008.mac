This flash is to document some of the changes to the OS&T system
since the publication of OS&T Manual Version 3.
.pp
These changes are:
.point begin
The ISPFLIST application found on the Master Application Menu has
been updated with several new options - see the tutorial for details.
.point
Dataset AOST.TESTCASE has been deleted since it appears there is no
interest in using it.
.point
Dataset AOST.DOCUMENT has been renamed AOST.OST.DOCUMENT.
.point
Dataset AOST.VM.DOCUMENT has been created to contain the machine
readable OS&T VM Testing Manual.
.point 2
Option V has been added to the AOST Menu to allow printing of this
manual of the Xerox 9700.
.point 1
The BDT transmission application which invokes the BDT/IUP product
has been enhanced to allow NEW allocations for the receiving dataset
when the transmitting dataset resides at another center.  Previously
this was not allowed.
.point
The FREEALL command in AOST.LOAD has been updated to not free files
which are flagged as permanently allocated.
.point
A new TSO Command is now available to mark all or selected dynamically
files as permanently allocated after TSO LOGON.  This command is
LOGALLOC and the documentation is attached.
.point
Clist AOSTLA is a clist which can be used to invoke LOGALLOC to mark
all ISPF files as permanently allocated, plus TASKLIB$, TASKLIB@,
SYSPROC and SYSHELP.
.point end
.pp
