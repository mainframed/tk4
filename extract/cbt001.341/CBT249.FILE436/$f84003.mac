This flash is to document some of the aids available to you to recover
from problems encountered when using a PDS.
These aids are:
.point begin
PDSGAS.
.point 2
Have you ever been editing a PDS member, saved it, and then wished you
hadn't.  You wish this because you couldn't get back to the original
member - and had to START ALL OVER AGAIN.
.point
PDSGAS is a program which will read thru your PDS and create a member
named $GASxxxx for each of these 'lost' members.  You can now recover
from your error.
.point
If you did a compress before running PDSGAS - you just lost the ability
to recover since the 'lost' member has been compressed out of
existence.
.point 1
EXPDIR.
.point 2
Have you ever run out of directory blocks in a PDS and wished to
expand the directory without having to recreate the dataset ?
.point 2
EXPDIR is a program to do just that.  It will expand the directory of
a specified PDS by the number of directory blocks that you tell it.
It does this without destroying any existing members.
.point 1
RESET and EMPTY.
.point 2
Have you ever needed to delete every member of a PDS and wanted a simple
way to do it,  without having to recreate the dataset ?
.point 2
There are two programs to do this for you:
.point
RESET is a batch program which will allow you to empty a PDS of all
members and optionally to change the number of directory blocks at
the same time.
.point
EMPTY is a TSO command which does the same thing as RESET, except that
it can also empty a sequential dataset as well.
.point end

All of these aids are available to the user's of the AOST ISPF system

convenience.
