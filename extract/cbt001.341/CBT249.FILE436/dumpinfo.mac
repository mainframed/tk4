                    SVC Dump Maintenance Procedure


   This is a guideline for the management of SVC system dumps.  There
are two types of system dumps -- the SVC dump and the stand alone dump.
Only the SVC dump will be dealt with herein.

.us SVC Dumps

   SVC Dumps can be operator invoked but most often are system invoked
when an error is detected in an address space.  These dumps are recorded
in preallocated dasd data sets named SYS1.DUMP00 through SYS1.DUMP09.
There is a maximum of ten dumps per cpu.

   The analysis, migration and deletion of the SVC dumps has been
semi-automated.  The first step is to list all the dump data sets.  This
may be done for systems H, I, K, L, M, or C by modifying the job card
and submitting:  '#AOSGP.MVS.CNTL(CHKDUMP)'.

   A listing for system G may similarly be obtained by modifying the job
card and submitting:  '#AOSGP.MVS.CNTL(CHKDUMPG)'.  If hardcopy is not
desired you may examine the dump data sets by executing TSO command file
'$A1246.DUMP.CLIST(CHKDUMP)'.  CHKDUMP is a program which lists the
volume, data set number, title, abend code, psw, and registers for each
full dump.  The batch version also lists the dumps which have been saved
on MSS.  You can also browse 'AOS.DUMPLOG' To determine which data sets
are saved on MSS.

   Next the CHKDUMP output must be reviewed for any dump that has
similar titles and abend codes as those dumps on RAT.  Any duplicates
can usually be deleted.  The rest of the full dumps will require
analysis to determine whether the dump was caused by a user or system
error.  The best way to accomplish this is through daily analysis of the
dumps with someone trained in dump diagnostics.  Note:  abend codes of
13E, 33E, and *22, are probably user errors and usually can be deleted.

   Once the decision has been made to delete or migrate the dumps, the
next step is to modify '#AOSGP.MVS.CNTL(IPCSCOPY)' To copy and EMPTY the
necessary dumps.  Run the modified job and distribute the output of the
copy steps to the groups responsible for that area of the operating
system.

   The dumps that are SPR'd can remain on RAT until the SPR is fixed and
closed.  Dumps not SPR'd or not acknowledged by the assigned group in
seven days can be deleted.  This is necessary because MSS space is
limited.

   To EMPTY a SVC dump from disk execute '$A1246.DUMP.CLIST(EMPTY)
Or run '#AOSGP.MVS.CNTL(IPCSCOPY)'.

   There is a quick way of deleting a dump which has been moved to MSS.
Execute the TSO command file '$A1246.DUMP.CLIST(SWIPE)'.  This will
prompt you for the required information to delete the dump from MSS.
This CLIST also deletes the entry from 'AOS.DUMPLOG'.
