The SYSDOCS were designed to be simple and consistent. All jobs
creating a backup of a direct access volume use a common cataloged
procedure and all volumes containing an SMP CDS use a common
cataloged procedure to list the CDS. All jobs have @SUMMARY as the
last step to simplify verification, depending on requirements for
information on individual volumes special steps have been added such
as @NEWCAT, AMBLIST, etc.


General comments:
    1) The programmer name in the job card must be PROD for UCC-1
       tape retention as described in the master retention list.
    2) The job name is descriptive of the volume being system
       documented.


Two cataloged procedures were installed for the SYSDOCS support.

   1) @SYSDOCS is consistent with the @ cataloged procedures except
      the step names is the same as the program names. The exceptions
      to this is the DASDR step (DASDR), the catalog step (catalog)
      and the ARETCODE step (ABENDX).


      A) the symbolic parameters are as follows:

      Symbolic parameter   default            description

        DASDR               IEH         the parameter is used to
                                        specify the DASDR program
                                        to be used to dump the
                                        disk. Either IEH or RI.

        SYSOUT              *           this parameter is used to
                                        specify an output class for
                                        print files. The default *
                                        allows all output to be
                                        directed to the class specified
                                        on the job card in the MSGCLASS
                                        parameter. The default is
                                        MSGCLASS=A.

        TUNIT               3400-5      the device type for the output
                                        of the DASDR unload. This
                                        parameter must be enclosed in
                                        single quotes if the device
                                        name has any special
                                        characters i. e. -.

        UNIT                            defines the device type
                                        of the volume to be system
                                        documented. This
                                        parameter must be enclosed in
                                        single quotes if the device
                                        name has any special
                                        characters i. e. -.

        VOL                             defines the volume serial number
                                        of the volume to be system
                                        documented.


      B) the steps are defined as follows:

       Stepname/program                    description

       IEFBR14/IEFBR14                  this is a dummy step at the
                                        beginning to allow for step
                                        overridding with conditon
                                        codes.

       DASDR/IEHDASDR or RIDASDR        this step unloads the direct
                                        access device to tape. RIDASDR
                                        is required for volumes
                                        containing VSAM data sets.
                                        The control care for DASDR is
                                        in a member of SYS1.SYSPARM
                                        Named dasdrdmp. The STEPLIB
                                        points to SYS1.APFLIB.

       CATALOG/IEFBR14                  this step cataloges the output
                                        tape created by the DASDR step
                                        when the DASDR step is
                                        successful and sets a condition
                                        code of zero.

       ABENDX/ARETCODE                  this step will abend if the
                                        DASDR step set a condition code
                                        greater than zero. The abend
                                        will be a SYSTEM 806 until the
                                        ARETCODE program is completed
                                        and then with a UDRT 100.

       VTOCLIST/VTOCLIST                This step list the VTOC using
                                        the VTOCLIST program.

       MAPDISK/MAPDISK                  MAPDISK Maps the volume and
                                        passes the print output to
                                        the mapmap program for mapping
                                        and printing.

       MAPMAP/MAPMAP                    this program reads the output
                                        of MAPDISK and sorts the
                                        data set names by track
                                        location and reports the
                                        data sets in the actual
                                        order they reside on the
                                        volume. It also prints out
                                        the output of MAPDISK.

        VTOCMAP/VTOCMAP                 This program optionally maps
                                        the VTOC, lists the members
                                        of PDS's, and lists the
                                        SYSCTLG on the specified volume.



     C) the following describes the common DD names.


   DDNAME                 Description

   DISK      -   the common DD name in all steps defining the volume
                 that is to be system documented.

   TAPE      -   the DD name for the backup volume.

   2) The @CDSLIST cataloged procedure is used to list the CDS on
      thoses volume containing SMP CDS data sets. The ddnanes are
      in ascending order and the step name is cdslist.

      A) the symbolic parameters are as follows:

      Symbolic parameter   default            description
        UNIT                            defines the device type
                                        of the volume to be system
                                        documented. This
                                        parameter must be enclosed in
                                        single quotes if the device
                                        name has any special
                                        characters i. e. -.

        VOL                             defines the volume serial number
                                        of the volume to be system
                                        documented.

        SYSOUT              *           this parameter is used to
                                        specify an output class for
                                        print files. The default *
                                        allows all output to be
                                        directed to the class specified
                                        on the job card in the MSGCLASS
                                        parameter. The default is
                                        MSGCLASS=A.
