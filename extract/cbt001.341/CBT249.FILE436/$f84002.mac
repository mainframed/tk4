Effective March 1, 1984 the PDSCLEAR program will be deleted from
the AOST load library.  You should change your JCL to use the RESET
program which will perform the same function, but in a safer manner.
.pp
The reason for this is that the PDSCLEAR program requires authorization
because it updates the VTOC itself.  This requires that it know how
many tracks per cylinder for the device and how many directory blocks
can be allocated on a track so that it can write binary zeros over all
allocated directory blocks.
.pp
In other words, the PDSCLEAR program will have to be changed for each
new dasd that we get.  Not a desirable thought.
.pp
The RESET program uses standard system services and does not require
APF authorization.  It does not care about the physical device
characteristics and does not have to be modified for new devices.
The documentation for the RESET program is attached.

If this will cause you any problems please contact me ASAP.
