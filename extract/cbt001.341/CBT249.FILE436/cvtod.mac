.ix 'CVTOD Macro'
.pp
This macro was stolen from a UCLA TSO command called DUMPINFO and was
converted to a macro by L. Dyck for generalized use.
It's purpose is to convert a TOD to something meaningful to us human
beings.
.pp
To use this macro simply code CVTOD in your assembler language program.
It will generate inline code including it's own data constants.  If
NOGEN is specified then the output fields will be assumed to have been
allocated,  which can be done by coding the DATA to cause only the
generation of the output fields.
.pp
This macro requires that on entry register 1 contain the address of a
double word containing a TOD value.  On exit you can access the
converted values either via the labels or use register 1 which will
now contain the address of the converted data.
.pp
To use this macro in a reentrant program you will have to define a
DSECT and invoke the macro using the DATA option.  Then in the
CSECT invoke the macro using the NOGEN option.
