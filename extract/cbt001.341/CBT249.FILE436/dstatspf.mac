    Compute data set useage statistics for disk data sets for ISPF.
.sp 2
.subsection 'Description'
.sp 2
         This program formats information on any disk data set.  It
         reads through the entire data set and outputs disk track usage,
         blocksize and other statistics.

.subsection 'Operation'
.sp 2
        a.  The program gets the input data set name and volume serial
            number via "RDJFCB".

        B.  The program inputs the format 1 DSCB to determine other data
            set characteristics.

        C.  The program opens the input file, then formats and outputs
            DEB and DSCB information.

        D.  If a parm of "label" is not coded, the program reads each
            block of data in the data set and collects record counts,
            record size and track useage statistics.

        E.  Additional processing:

            1. For DSORG=PS, none.

            2. For DSORG=DA, none.

            3. For DSORG=IS, the program reads through the entire data
               set (there may be up to three separate files of data and
               reports on each file.  Also, the program inputs the ISAM
               label (format two DSCB) record and provides a data set
               profile which includes data set reorgainization data and
               data set characteristics.

            4. For DSORG=PO, the program compares directory ttr's
               against actual disk addresses to determine the ttrs of
               "gas" members (the program also outputs the first 79
               characters of any gas member).  Statistics are maintained
               on the size of gas and real members and the number of
               alias members.
               If any aliases are in the data set, a check is made to
               see that corresponding real entries also exist.  Note: a
               parm of 'no' will nullify the gas ttr report.

        F.  For PARM=ISPF, the program will issue ISPF VPUTs
            for the following information:
                   DSORG
                   RECFM
                   LRECL
                   BLKSIZE
                   TOTSIZE  (in tracks)
                   DIRBLKS

        G.  For PARM=DCB, only the DCB will be displayed for ISPF
