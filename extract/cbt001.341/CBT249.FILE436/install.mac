.ix AOST Installation
.pp
To install the AOST programs, clists, TSO commands and ISPF datasets
you will need to allocate all of the datasets documented in Chapter
.ur &libchap .
.pp
You will also have to edit the $C TSO Command to change the SPF SVC
number (221 here in the WCC) to set the JSCBAUTH flag on so that
the @C and @P aliases can invoke authorized commands and programs.
.pp
To use the $C and it's aliases under ISPF you will have to add them
to ISPF module ISPTCM, and flag them as command processors.
.pp
Next if ACF2 is installed you will have to define the resources to
ACF2 to allow access to the non-authorized facilities ($) and the
authorized facilities (@) provided by these commands ($C $P @C @P).
The default resources are: type= CMD name= $SYSUTIL and @SYSUTIL.
.pp
If ACF2 changes then these commands might need to be reassembled.
.pp
If PCF II is installed then the $C, $P, @C, @P commands must be
authorized for the selected user audience.
.pp
The IEAAPFxx member of SYS1.PARMLIB will have to be updated to
show AOST.LOAD as an authorized library.
.pp
$C will now have to be assembled and linkedited RENT and AC=1.
$C will link with aliases @C, @P and $P, and should be in either
SYS1.LPALIB or MLPA'd at IPL.
.pp
You must now authorize each specific user or group of users to use
these ACF2 resources or no one will be able to use them.
.pp
Program SHOW is a generalized callable program to return to the
caller selected information from system type control blocks.  It is
currently set up to extract information from the ACF2 LID control block
such as programmer name, phone, mail code, etc.  This program should
be modified to work in your enviroment.
