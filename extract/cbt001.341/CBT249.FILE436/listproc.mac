.subsection 'Description'

 The contents of a data set may be listed on an operator console in a
 format similar to that provided by the TSO LIST command.  It is invoked
 by entering the following:

 START LIST ,SYSALLDA ,volser  ,DSN=dsname (member) ,LINE=___57____
 S     L       unites the number of characters per line on the console.

 The information provided consists of the data set name and each logical
 record (printed on multiple lines if necessary), followed by the
 message "***END OF DATA***".  There will be a one second delay between
 logical records to prevent excessive queued console output.  A CANCEL
 command may be issued to terminate the output.

 Most error conditions will be diagnosed, and prompting may occur for
 correct values.  In many cases it may be possible to circumvent a
 problem by specifying explicit DCB subparameters on the START command.
 In addition, the  JCL specifies DCB=EROPT=ACC.  If an I/O error does
 occured a SYNADAF message willl be printed containing the prefix
 "***UNCORRECTABLE I/O ERROR***", then the acttion specified by EROPT
 will be taken.
