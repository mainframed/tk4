.ix Program OFFLOAD
.sp
This program was dis-assembled to get the source.
.pp
This program will unload a PDS into card images for transportability
based upon the provided control cards.
.sp 2
The control cards are:
.sp
O I=indd,O=outdd  (,T=IEBUPDTE)
.sp
S M=xxxx   to Select a member
.sp
E M=xxxx   to Exclude a member
.pp
If T=IEBUPDTE is included then ./ ADD NAME=xxx cards will be generated
prior to each member and all ./ control cards found in the input will
be changed to >< in columns 1 and 2 to allow easier reloading.
.sp 3
Note: You will have a problem offloading a PDS that is not blocked
(i.e. PARMLIB).
