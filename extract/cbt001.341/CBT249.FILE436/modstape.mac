We have 2 MODS tapes in house.
One from CBT and one from SHARE.

The latest version of the Connecticut Bank and Trust MVS Mods tape
is now in house and has been loaded out onto the 3850.  The dataset
naming convention is:
.sp
AOST.CBT.FILExxx.DATA or
AOST.CBT.FILExxx.PDS
.sp
Where xxx is the file sequence number, and where DATA indicates a
sequential file and PDS is a partitioned file.
.sp
The directory of the tape may be viewed by browsing
AOST.CBT.FILE001.DATA under ISPF.
.sp
If you find any program, TSO command or ? on this tape which will
be useful to you in your job,  please let me so that it can be
documented in the OS & T manual for others.  Remember the OS & T
is a central repository for all locally used system programming
tools, and will only work if we all contribute.
.sp
The SHARE mods tape is loaded out using the dataset names of:
.br
AOST.SHARE.FILExxx.yyy
.sp
Where xxx is the file sequence number and yyy is dependent upon the
file type.  To determine the file type see the directory which is:
.br
AOST.SHARE.FILE001.TEXT
