     required DD cards
    //  EXEC PGM=LISTCDS,PARM='TITLE=XXX'
    //SMPCDS DD DSN=SYS1.SMPCDS,DISP=SHR
    //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=A
     Optional DDNAME:
    //SNAPPRT DD SYSOUT=A
 Note--this DDNAME is opened only upon an error condition if SNAP
        is a one of the parms.

 Assembly of this program will require other macros
 than are normally in SYS1.MACLIB
 The macros can usually be found in SYS1.AMODGEN And SYS1.APVTMACS

 Include IEFSD095 from SYS1.AOSB0 In the link-edit step

.subsection 'Parm options'

 This routine processes all the parm options:
       LINECT     line count for controlling pages breaks
       SIZE       override for the 2 incore tables
       NOHEADER   prevents header pages
       TITLE      puts in a 1-9 char title in header pages
       SNAP       snaps unknown subentries

 LINECT is in the form of 'LINECT=55' (2 digits   01-99)
 note - if linect is less than the number of lines required to fit
 the header page, the header pages will be split up.

 TITLE is in the form of 'TITLE=SMP LIST' (1-8 char)
 default title is 'CDS LIST'.

 SIZE is in the form of 'SIZE=(999999)' (1-9 digits for both values)
 or 'SIZE=(99999,99999)'   or 'SIZE=(,99999)'
 first value is for the MOD/MAC table   (default is 650,000)
 second value is for the SYSMOD table   (default is 200,000)
 SIZE should be used if the program quits with the WTO
     'MOD/MAC table GETMAINED storage exceeded'   or
     'SYSMOD table GETMAINED storage exceeded'
