.subsection 'Description'

 The attributes of a data set may be listed on an operator console in a
 format similar to that provided by the TSO LISTDS command.  It is
 invoked by entering the following:


      S       LISTDS    ,3330   ,volser    ,DSN=dsname  (member)
      START   LISTD     ,unit


 The information provided consists of RECFM, LRECL, BLKSIZE, DSORG and
 volume serial.  If a member name is specified, the directory entry will
 be provided in hexadecimal.

 Self-explanatory error messages are provideed for various conditions,
 such as data set or member not found.  However, if the data set is
 located through the catalog (unit and volser not specified) and cannot
 be found, a JCL error will occur.
