This flash is to document some of the additions to the OS&T libraries
since the last FLASH and the $ON CLIST to be used by the new ISPF
effective 3/25/84.
.pp
When the new ISPF is installed in production on 3/25/84 you will
immediately be placed into the ISPF Primary Option Menu after LOGON.
If you desire to do anything else immediately after LOGON or to
enter the AOST ISPF then you will need to do the
following:
.point begin
Allocate a CLIST library with the name userid.PROC.CLIST.
.point
Create a member called $ON.
.point
Insert into the $ON clist the commands you wish executed immediately
after LOGON.  This member may also be nothing more than an END card
if you desire.
.point
I would suggest that you copy your current clist that you use to
allocate the AOST libraries into the $ON clist.
.point end
.pp
Additions and Changes to the AOST Manual are:
.point begin

An ISPF utility to build an ISPF table containing all members of
a specified PDS for use by other ISPF programs.
