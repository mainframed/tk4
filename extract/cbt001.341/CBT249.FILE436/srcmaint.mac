The source maintenance system under ISPF was developed based upon the
following ideas:
.Point begin
IBM source maintained systems require modification to provide functions
which are required locally but which IBM will not, or currently does not
provide.
.Point
When IBM code is modified, it should be modified via SMP for tracking
and control purposes.
.Point
User code added to an existing IBM module must never delete any of the
original IBM statements.
.Point
User modification should be developed such that no one modification is
dependent upon the existence of another.
.Point
All local source modules should be managed under SMP as well.
.point end
.pp
With these ideas as the foundation, the ISPF Source Maintenance System
was developed.  It was originally coded with JES3 as the initial IBM
system to be maintained, but has proven flexible enough for any source
system.
.pp
The system is used by entering the SOURCEM panel of ISPF and selecting
the source product to be maintained (i.e. option 1 is JES3 Production).
Next the SRCMAINT menu is entered.  This menu provides the interface
to the Source Maintenance system itself.
.pp
The first time a user enters the SRCMAINT menu, the ISPF variables need
to be initialized.  To provide a simple way to do this, option I will
take the user to the initialization menu.  This menu allows the user
to initialize all the key variables used in this system.  NOTE that
each item on the SOURCEM menu is entered as a seperate ISPF application
id to allow seperate ISPF variable pools for each product.
.pp
Once the variables are initialized, the user is ready to procede with
the allocation of the datasets designated during initialization.
These datasets are:
.point begin
Control Dataset.
.point 2
This is a PDS, with DCB=(RECFM=FB,LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=80*nn).  It will
contain an entry for every source element (module/macro) that is or
has been updated by the user.  This is your control log dataset to
allow the user to prevent more than one individual from working with
the same element.
.point 1
Proposal Dataset.
.point 2
This is a PDS, LRECL=80, to contain online all Modification Request
or Proposal forms.  Option R on the SRCMAINT menu will copy the model
form into this dataset and place the user into ISPF EDIT to simplify
the creation of this request form.
.point 1
Tracking Dataset.
.point 2
This is a sequential dataset or a member of a PDS, depending upon the
dsname chosen during initialization.  It can be of any organization
and format you wish as the TRACKING menu item simply enters ISPF EDIT
to allow the user to update the tracking log.
.point
For example, the format of this dataset for the JES3 group is:
.point 3
Mod id.  This is the USERMOD id chosen for a modification.
.point
Mod Request.  This is number of the Modification Request form
used to initially ask for the modification.
.point
Programmer Name.  This is the name of the programmer doing the USERMOD.
.point
Start Date.
.point
End Date.
.point
Status.  USERMOD status where C = Complete and IP = In Progress.
.point
Description. A one line description of the modification.
.point 1
User Modification library.
.point 2
This is a PDS under the user's TSO id which is used by the user to
EDIT source/macro elements while building the USERMOD.
.point 1
User Object library.
.point 2
This is a PDS used by the Assembly panel to output the object deck
for the trial/test assemblies.
It is also used as input by the Linkedit panel to acquire the
object decks.
.point 1
ISPF SMP Skeleton.
.point 2
This is the model JCL which will be used by the SMPBATCH panel to be
tailored prior to submitting the SMP batch job.
.point
You can use the JES3 member as a sample.  This member is used to
maintain JES3 and also utilizes the CCMC option if specified.

For more information on Source Maintenance the following documentation
is available:
.point begin
Check the INDEX of this manual for SRCMAINT.  Under this heading you
will find a reference for all of the programs used in the Source
Maintenance System.
.point
Each product on the SOURCEM menu should have it's own Maintenance Manual
to document their own unique maintenance techniques and standards.
.point 2
The JES3 Maintenance Manual is available by contacting the JES3 group
if you would like a sample.
