         The purpose if this program is to compare two
         partitioned data sets based upon the parm options
         specified. The program will compare directory entries
         only, it will compare 80 byte members by columns 1-72
         or by the sequence field (73-80) or it will compare
         SMP rel 4 CDS SYSMOD entries. Any descripenties will be
         listed on the SYSPRINT data set.

         JCL Required:

         //PDSCOMPR EXEC PGM=PDSCOMPR,PARM='  SEE NOTE   '
         //STEPLIB  DD  DSN=AOST.LOAD,DISP=SHR
         //SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
         //PDS1     DD  DSN=  NAME OF OLD PDS
         //PDS2     DD  DSN=  NAME OF NEW PDS
         //SYSUDUMP DD  SYSOUT=*

         Parm options:
         directory - compare PDS directory entries only
         members   - compare each members records by all 80 bytes
         seqfield  - compare each members records by the sequence
                     field (73-80)
         SYSMOD    - compare the SYSMOD entries
         linecount - number of lines per page value from 01 to 99
                     default is 58

         Limit     - option when used with the 'members' or
                     'seqfield' options,. This option limits
                     the number of mismatches printed out
                     to ten (10). If this option is not
                     the default is all mismatches will be
                     listed.
         Limit     - option when used with 'SYSMOD', this will
                     print only the SYSMOD differences and
                     not the apply date & time differences.
