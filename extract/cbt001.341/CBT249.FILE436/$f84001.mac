------------------------------------------------------------------------
This AOST Flash reflects changes and/or enhancements to the OS&T system.
These changes will be reflected in the next release of the OS&T Manual.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Theses updates may be filed at the beginning of the OS & T, or the end
for reference until a new release of the manual is published.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Included in this Flash are:
.sp
A new TSO command which can be used in a CLIST to determine if the
CLIST is being invoked under ISPF or TSO.
.sp
Documentation on how to use the AOST ISPF application in SWCC.
.sp
A new chapter on some of the generalized services available for the
ISPF user in addition to the standard IBM facilities.
.sp
A replacement for the Xerox 9700 panel and tutorials will be installed
on January 30, 1984.  This new panel will support the new Xerox 9700
Job Descriptor Entries which have been prepared and are now available
on every Xerox 9700 in the corporation.  A tutorial panel has been
prepared documenting the differences.
.sp
This Xerox panel will allow you to specify which Xerox 9700 you wish
to use and will then remember it in the ISPF profile for future use.
.sp
I would advise you to try the various JDE's to determine which has the
format and font that you prefer since they have added some new
interesting fonts.  If a JDE that you were using is missing and there
is no comparable new JDE you may continue using the old JDE's, BUT
please inform myself or contact Bill Vincent on extension 2569.
.sp
I am in the process of designing a program which will provide this
facility in batch, it will also be able to support the Xerox 2700.
So stay tuned.
.sp
------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am in the process of merging all of the AOST Flashes into an updated
OS&T Manual.  If you have any comments, suggestions or corrections for
the manual please let me know as soon as possible (ASAP).  This can be
done using the FEEDBACK facility or by calling me on extension 1647.
.sp
------------------------------------------------------------------------
.us A word of CAUTION:
The new ISPF/PDF product uses a different enq name
to insure dataset integrity than the current version of SPF.  This means
that two user's can update the same dataset if each is using a different
version of ISPF.

Please forward any comments, suggestions and/or additions for the OS & T
manual, ISPF panels or libraries to me.
.sp
If you do not wish to receive the AOST manual and flashes OR want to
add another person to the distribution list please let me know.
