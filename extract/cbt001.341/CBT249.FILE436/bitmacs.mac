.section 'BIT Manipulation Macros'
.sp 3
     These macros are designed to assist the programmer in establishing
and using flag bits.  There are five macros.
.sp 2
.subsection 'BITSW - Define Bit Settings'
.ix 'BITSW Macro'
.ix Macros BITSW
.sp
     You can define upto 8 flag bits per byte and BITSW will do this
for you.
.sp
     The syntax is :

label   BITSW bit0,bit1,bit2,bit3,bit4,bit5,bit6,bit7,DSECT
.sp
     Where BIT0 thru BIT7 are your labels.
.sp 2
.subsection 'IFON    - Test ON Status'
.ix 'IFON Macro'
.ix Macros IFON
.sp
     This macro will allow you to test the status of a flag bit.

     The syntax is:

label   IFON  bit,bryes,brno
.sp
     Where bit is the name defined in the BITSW macro, bryes is the true
     condition, and optionally brno is the false condition.
.sp 2
.subsection 'IFOFF    - Test OFF Status'
.ix 'IFOFF Macro'
.ix Macros IFOFF
.sp
     This macro will allow you to test the status of a flag bit.

     The syntax is:

label    IFOFF bit,brof,bron
.sp
     Where bit is the name defined in the BITSW macro, brof is the
true condition, and optonally bron is the false condition.
.sp 2
.subsection 'SETON    - Set a Flag ON'
.ix 'SETON Macro'
.ix Macros SETON
.sp
     This macro will allow you to turn on a flag bit.

     The syntax is:

label    SETON a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p
.sp
     You can turn ON up to 16 flag bits per execution of this macro.
.sp 2
.subsection 'SETOF    - Turn OFF a Flag'
.ix 'SETOF Macro'
.ix Macros SETOF
.sp
     This macro will allow you to turn off a flag bit.

     The syntax is:

label    SETOF a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p
.sp
     You can turn off up to 16 flag bits per execution of this macro.
