THIS FILE CONTAINS PART OF A STRUCTURED MACRO PACKAGE WRITTEN BY
GARY NEMETH AT AMERITRUST IN CLEVELAND. ONLY THE MACROS NEEDED BY
PROGRAMS ON THIS FILE HAVE BEEN INCLUDED. WE HAVE HIS PERMISSION TO
DISTRIBUTE THESE MACROS FOR USE IN THE PROGRAMS ON THIS FILE.

$$DOC    - THE DOCUMENTATION YOU ARE READING NOW. IT SHOULD BE USED IN
           CONJUNCTION WITH THE SOURCE OF THE PROGRAMS.

$$DOCMSG - DOCUMENTATION FOR THE USE OF THE RNBMSG MACRO, WHICH IS USED
           ALONG WITH PROGRAM TEC462 IN THIS FILE TO PROVIDE A SIMPLER
           INTERFACE TO PUTLINE OR WTO THAN IBM PROVIDES. IT ALLOWS ONE
           TO EASILY ISSUE MESSAGES WITH INSERTS, EITHER VIA PUTLINE
           OR WTO.  NOTE: RNBMSG AND TEC462 IMPLEMENT A FUNCTION CALLED
           WTOLOG. THIS FUNCTION USES ROUTCODE 14 TO WTO A MESSAGE,
           ASSUMING THAT MESSAGES WITH A ROUTCODE OF 14 WILL NOT BE SENT
           TO THE CONSOLE, BUT ONLY TO THE SYSLOG. THE IEECVXIT ON THIS
           FILE WILL DO THAT, AS WELL AS OTHER THINGS. WE USE ROUTCODE
           14 FOR MESSAGES THAT THE SYSTEMS PROGRAMMERS MAY SOMETIMES
           NEED TO SEE, BUT THAT THE OPERATORS SHOULD NOT BE INTERESTED
           IN.

$EECVXIT - THIS IS A COPY OF OUR IEECVXIT ROUTINE. IT IS PROVIDED HERE
           ONLY AS A MODEL OF HOW WE HANDLE ROUTCODE 14 (WE DON'T LET
           MESSAGES WITH ROUTCODE=14 GO TO THE CONSOLE, TO AVOID
           CLUTTERING THE CONSOLES WITH INFORMATIONAL MESSAGES FROM
           SOME OF OUR PROGRAMS). I WOULD NOT INSTALL THIS IEECVXIT,
           BUT ONLY USE IT AS A MODEL. SOME OF THE COMMENTS ARE
           MISLEADING ABOUT WHICH MESSAGES ARE PROCESSED (IEF452/3?)
           AS THEY ARE NOT SEEN BY IEECVXIT, AND SO CANNOT BE PROCESSED.

$IMS210  - THIS IS A MODIFICATION OF A PROGRAM OBTAINED FROM FILE 332
           OF VERSION 199 OF THE CBT TAPE. THIS VERSION HAS BEEN
           REWRITTEN USING THE STRUCTURED MACROS FROM THIS FILE, AND
           USES RNBMSG/TEC462 TO ISSUE ERROR MESSAGES WHEN NECESSARY.
           THE MAJOR DIFFERENCES FROM THE ORIGINAL VERSION ARE:
             (1) THE PROGRAM WILL READ A SEQUENTIAL FILE INSTEAD OF A
                 PDS IF INVOKED AS A BATCH JOB INSTEAD OF AS A STARTED
                 TASK (THIS MAKES IT EASIER IN OUR ENVIRONMENT TO HAVE
                 A BATCH JOB ISSUE COMMANDS);
             (2) THE INPUT FORMAT HAS BEEN CHANGED TO ALLOW A FIELD
                 FOR AN IMS ID. IF A RECORD CONTAINS AN IMS ID, THE
                 OUTSTANDING WTOR FOR THAT IMS ID WILL BE FOUND AND
                 THE COMMAND WILL BE ISSUED AS A REPLY TO THE WTOR.
                 THIS FUNCTION IS CODED FOR SP1.3.X LEVEL SYSTEMS.
                 IF THE IMS ID IS **** THE PROGRAM WILL TERMINATE. IF
                 THE IMS ID IS ++++ THE PROGRAM WILL WAIT FOR THE
                 NUMBER OF SECONDS SPECIFIED IN THE COMMAND BEFORE
                 ISSUING THE NEXT COMMAND.

$TEC462  - THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES A SIMPLE INTERFACE TO PUTLINE AND
           WTO FOR ISSUING MESSAGES WITH INSERTS (OR WITHOUT THEM FOR
           THAT MATTER). IKJEFF02 IS USED TO FORMAT THE MESSAGES. THE
           PROGRAM IS INVOKED BY THE RNBMSG MACRO. IT MAY BE USED FROM
           BATCH PROGRAMS OR TSO COMMANDS.

RNBMSG*  - THE MEMBERS WITH A PREFIX OF RNBMSG COMPRISE THE MACROS
           USED TO OUTPUT MESSAGES VIA TEC462.

ALL OTHERS - EVERYTHING ELSE ON THE FILE IS PART OF GARY NEMETH'S
             STRUCTURED MACRO PACKAGE, WITH SOME MODIFICATIONS BY
             RAINIER NATIONAL BANK PERSONNEL.
