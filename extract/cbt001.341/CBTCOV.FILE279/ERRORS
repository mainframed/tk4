00000020.h1 Error Processing
00000030The program attempts to identify any erroneous inputs in either the Master input file or in the invoking command.
00000040.h2 Error Severity Philosophy
00000050There are four, progressively more severe levels of error: Warning, Error, Severe Error and Terminal Error.
00000060Each of the following error conditions are identified as to severity by W, E, S or T, respectively.
00000070.ke Errors
00000080.sp;.kp on;.of 6;W(__) Warnings will be issued upon detection of any questionable or clearly correctable faults.
00000090Execution will continue following the message, with the explained correction in effect.
00000100Note that any such corrective action effects only the current run: the Master file remains in its orginal state.
00000110.kp off;.br;.ke Warnings
00000120.sp;.kp on;.of 6;E(__) Errors will be diagnosed for clearly erroneous data, for which the proper corrective action is not obvious.
00000130If the run is in the background (Batch), execution will continue following the guessed_______ correction.
00000140If the run is interactive (TSO), and the Master file is being read from, execution will continue until the Master file has been all examined, then terminated.
00000150.kp off;.br;.ke Errors
00000160.sp;.kp on;.of 6;S(__) Severe errors are detected and diagnosed for such input conditions as offer no automatic corrections.
00000170Execution will always conclude at this point.
00000180.kp off;.br;.ke 'Severe Errors'
00000190.sp;.kp on;.of 6;T(__) Terminal errors can occur, but as no fault of the user.
00000200System or program failure is indicated.
00000210The programmer should be notified immediately, supplying all available information.
00000220Execution will be terminated immediately.
00000230.kp off;.br;.ke 'Terminal Errors'
00000240.of 0;.h2 Enumeration of Possible Errors;An enumeration of all likely error conditions, the associated error levels, the attempted fixup action, and suggested user fixup action follows.
00000250The system version of this manual contains back references to the invoking routines.
00000260.sp;.of 6;T(00) System_______error_____.
00000270.br;This event should never occur;  if it does, it should probably be brought to the attention of EDC Programming.
00000280In some cases, previous erroneous conditions can "cascade" into this situation, which can be dealt with by the user.
