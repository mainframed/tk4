00000350The Ryan Script Text Processing Facility may be invoked by means of the Script Command.
00000360Script operates on files, typically developed through use of the Editor.
00000370As the user develops his file from the terminal, he includes Script control words, which direct the actions of the Script processor as it reads the file. These are in the form: .control-word xxx.
00000380.br;Script has many formatting capabilities that make it useful for many different kinds of documents
00000390such as working papers, program documentation, reports and internal newsletters.
00000400Combined with the powerful context editing capabilities of the Editor,
00000410Script is an efficient and economical means of preparing these documents.
00000420Modifications and additions to documents can be made easilly.
00000430In addition, the multi-programming environment of the IBM370 permits text processing applications
00000440to be run concurrently with other installation work.
00000450Script provides various text processing capabilities, including:
00000460.nj;.ss
00000470.sp;.of 3;¤  One to twenty columns of text per page.
00000480.sp;.of 3;¤  As-is, justified, hyphenated, right-adjusted, or ragged right composition.
00000490.sp;.of 3;¤  Automatic page numbering in Arabic, English or lower-case Roman, with fractional pagination options.
00000500.sp;.of 3;¤  Automatic generation of multiple top and bottom titles, with even and odd page options.
00000510.sp;.of 3;¤  Simple generation of form letters with or without variable information from a terminal or other source.
00000520.sp;.of 3;¤  Inclusion of the contents of other Script files.
00000530.sp;.of 3;¤  Extensive macro capabilities to permit defining shorthand symbols for frequently-used sequences of control words.
00000540.sp;.of 3;¤  As many as nine revision indicators that will print at the left margin.
00000550.sp;.of 3;¤  Conditional printing of different sections of a document.
00000560.sp;.of 3;¤  Some information retrieval capability.
00000570.ds;.ju;.of 0
00000580.h2 Preparing to use Script;Because Script operates in the interactive environment (TSO) of the IBM370 computer,
00000590to make use of it you must first establish a connection with the IBM370 from your typewriter terminal.
00000600If it has not already been done, the prospective user must also establish TSO access authorization, this being the responsibility of Engineering Digital Computing (ext. 300).
00000610Additional documentation, tutorial sessions and consultation are also available through EDC.
00000620Once you have done this, you use the Editor to develop a Script file which contains the information for your document.
00000630This information consists of text, the information you wish to be printed,
00000640and Script control words,
00000650special statements that direct the operation of Script and determine the appearance of your printed output.
00000660.h3 Your Typewriter Terminal
00000670Your communication with the computer may be by means of an IBM 2741 Communications Terminal,
00000680similar to an IBM Selectric typewriter.
00000690You will find a switch on the cabinet in which the typewriter is mounted;
00000700when the switch is set to LCL you have an ordinary Selectric typewriter;
00000710by switching to COM you can be linked to the central computer by telephone line,
00000720and your typewriter is now a typewriter terminal.
00000730In this latter mode, you and the computer converse through messages that you type via your terminal to the computer,
00000740and responses you receive back at your terminal.
00000750If your terminal is not an IBM 2741, refer to the appropriate "Terminal User's Guide" for that device.
00000760.h3 Preparing to Logon
00000770In order to log on, that is, to establish a connection with the system from your terminal,
00000780you need a user identification (userid or ID) and a password,
00000790which you can obtain from the operations group at your installation.
00000800To prepare your terminal, set the left margin at 1 and the right margin at 130,
00000810in order to provide maximum typing width.
00000820(You should have a #963 typing element for an EBCDIC terminal, and a #015 element for a correspondence terminal).
00000830Make sure the switch on the left side of the cabinet is on COM.
00000840.nj;.cc 12;.h3 Logging on
00000850.ss;.ke Logon Return
00000860.br;.of 3;1. Turn the terminal on.
00000870.sp;.of 3;2. Dial the appropriate telephone number.
00000880.sp;.of 3;3. When a high-pitched continuous tone is heard on the phone, place the phone in the acoustic coupler.
00000890.sp;.of 3;4. After the system types out: ENTER LOGON
00000900.sp;.of 3;5. Type in LOGON, and depress the RETURN key.
00000910.sp;.of 3;6. Then respond to the system prompts.
00000920.sp;.of 3;7. When the system is prepared to accept your instructions, it will type out READY.
00000930.of 0;.ds;.ju;You are now ready to create a file, edit an existing file, print or process (Script) an existing file, etc.
00000940By entering simple commands (such as EDIT, LIST, PRINT, Script etc.) from the terminal,
00000950you access an extensive set of interactive facilities, as well as create and format Script files.
00000960.sp;Text lines of a Script file should, of course, be typed exactly as you wish them to appear on output.
00000970The system generally types its messages to you in uppercase.
00000980Your Command entries appear to the system as uppercase, no matter how you type them in;
00000990the practice of using only lowercase for commands is merely a convention to improve the readability of your terminal printout.

00001270.ds;.h2 Your Script File
00001280The source data representing your document is stored for you by the data management facilities
00001290of the computer system and is called a Script file.
00001300It is composed of records and resides on disk space allocated to you and is usually identified by your userid.
00001310The typical TSO dataset name will ordinarilly be fully specified as 'userid.Script.TEXT(membername)', and may be addressed by means of the usual TSO abbreviations.
00001320Script files consist of text lines and special command words which you type in at your terminal.
00001330.h3 Creating and Modifying your Script File with the Editor
00001340The EDIT facility enables you to create your Script file, make changes to the file, or simply peruse its contents.
00001350There are two modes of operation when using the Editor: Input and Edit.
00001360The EDIT command is used to invoke the Edit facility:
00001370.in 5;EDIT Script(filename) TEXT
00001380.ke Edit Input Save
00001390.in 0;.h3 Creating a Script File
00001400First, decide on a filename.
00001410The maximum length of a filename is eight characters.
00001420Any alphanumeric characters (A-Z,0-9) may be used, starting with an alphabetic.
00001430The filename and the user's dataset-name uniquely identify a file for access by the TSO commands.
00001440When you are creating a file, make certain you choose a new and unique filename. Next, issue the command:
00001450.in 5;EDIT Script(filename) TEXT NEW
00001460.in 0;and depress the Return key. The system responds with:
00001470.in 5;INPUT
00001480.ss;.br;00010
00001490.ds;.in 0;You are now in Input mode and ready to type in your file,
00001500one line at a time, hitting RETURN at the end of each line.
00001510The 00010 signifies the first line. Each line is associated with a line number, which normally starts at 10 and increments by 10 (for convenient later insertion).
00001520.sp;Your Script file contains textual information plus special Script command words for controlling the format of your output.
00001530These commands are generally typed on separate lines from the text, and always start with a period in position 1.
00001540.sp;When you have finished typing in your file you must store it.
00001550To do this, you must leave Input mode and enter Edit mode.
00001560To enter Edit mode, hit RETURN on a "null" line (a line on which nothing has been typed -- not even spaces --
00001570and, therefore, the typing element is at the left margin).
00001580The system responds with:
00001590.in 5;EDIT
00001600.in 0;You type:
00001610.in 5;SAVE
00001620.in 0;and hit RETURN. The system types:
00001630.in 5;SAVED
00001640.in 0;To exit from the Edit facility, you enter:
00001650.in 5;END
00001660.in 0;and hit RETURN. The system responds:
00001670.in 5;READY
00001680.in 0;While in the "Edit" mode, numerous editing subcommands are also available to the user.
00001690Examples are CHANGE, DELETE, FIND, INSERT etc, (see Appendix &EditA., Page &EditP.).
00001700.ke Change Delete Find Insert
00001710For further details, consult the IBM manual "TSO Command Language Reference" (GC28-6732).
00001720.h2 Additional Terminal Facilities
00001730There are additional capabilities which can help the terminal user while entering data (in any mode: READY, EDIT or INPUT).
00001740.h3 The Attention Key
00001750Most terminals offer an "interrupt" capability, in the form of an ATTN key (sometimes labelled BREAK or INTERRUPT).
00001760If the ATTN is pressed after a partial line has been typed (but without pressing RETURN), the effect is to ignore the partial line.
00001770If a computer program (e.g. Editor, Script etc.) is interrupted (i.e. by the ATTN key), control will pass back to the READY (TSO) state,
00001780at which point the user may either restore processing by just pressing RETURN,
00001790or any other other TSO command may be invoked instead.
00001800.ke Attention
00001810.h3 Line Deletion
00001820.ke Line
00001830If, while typing a line, you wish to "erase" or "ignore" the line being typed in, you should press the ATTN key once.
00001840The computer/terminal will respond with !D and the carriage will return; you may then procede as though the line does not exist.
00001850(If your particular terminal does not have an Attention key, alternative arrangements can be made).
00001860.h3 Character Deletion
00001870.ke Char
00001880If, while typing a line, you wish to "erase" or "rub-out" one or more characters, you should enter the appropriate number of "rub-out" characters, and then procede as though those characters had vanished.
00001890For most Script users, the "rub-out" character is the "at" symbol (@), but any other non-conflicting character can be arranged for.

00001920This section describes Script control words and how they are used to determine the appearance
00001930of documents printed via the Script command.
00001940The first set of control words presented consists of those used for page setup and titling.
00001950These control words enable you to specify top and bottom margins, line length, and top and bottom titles
00001960(running heads and feet).
00001970The second set of control words described in this section comprises those used to control text formatting.
00001980These control words determine whether your text will be centered or flush with the left or right margins,
00001990whether it will be right-justified, as-is, or ragged-right.
00002000(these terms are explained and illustrated as part of the appropriate control word descriptions).
00002010Following the text formatting control words are those for supplemental page formatting
00002020such as tab setting, indenting, page ejection and reserved space for illustrations or material from other Script files.
00002030The remaining control words are those that permit you to specify margin indicators for revised portions of your
00002040document, include only certain portions of it when printing, accept input from a terminal during printing,
00002050and direct selected portions of your document to the terminal even though the remainder is being printed offline.
00002060Two control words, set-symbol and substitute-symbol, are described separately at the end of this section.
00002070.h2 Notational Conventions used in this Manual
00002080.ke Abbreviations
00002090Each control word is shown in both its full and abbreviated form.
00002100You may enter either form when developing your document, as long as you begin each control word with the period character (.).
00002110Control words are separated from their arguments, and multiple arguments are separated from each other by one or more blanks.
00002120Although the diagonal character (/) is shown as the delimiter between portions of an argument,
00002130as in the even-page top-title control word, any character that does not appear in the argument can be used.
00002140Sometimes, parameters will be presented surrounded by square brackets [...];
00002150this means that the option(s) are entirely optional and their absence implies some specific default meaning.
00002160On the other hand, if options are surrounded by "curly" braces »...º, the user must specify a choice of one.
00002170In the description of the various control words' operands, there is significance in the lower and upper case letters:
00002180An operand described in lower case is to be replaced by some text, word, value or name (as explained below it).
00002190An operand described in upper case is a keyword, which if included by the user must be spelled precisely as is
00002200(but may actually be entered in any combination of upper or__ lower case).
00002210The presence of "Æ" indicates that the numeric following it is to be added (or subtracted) from the control parameter involved.
00002220.ke Æ
00002230.h2 Page Setup and Formatting
00002240Page setup and formatting consists basically of determining the dimensions of the final text on the page.
00002250Using the control words described below, you can specify top and bottom margins, left and right margins,
00002260the margins between body text and top and bottom titles (heads and feet),
00002270The number of title lines to be printed, and the type and position of page numbering.
00002280The diagram below illustrates a piece of paper, marked by the *'s.
00002290The body of the manuscript text is enclosed within the inner rectangle.

00002760.mc;.in 0;.fo;.h2 Specifying the Overall Dimensions of a Page;.nb
00002770You can specify the overall dimensions of a page primarily with two control words:
00002780.sp;.ce 3;LINE-LENGTH or .ll
00002790.ss;and
00002800PAGE-LENGTH or .pl
00002810.ds;.sp;These are supplemented by use of the various top and bottom margin control words
00002820to determine exactly where the text begins and ends on the page whose length you have specified.
00002830.cc 14;.h2 Margins and Titles
00002840Script provides ten buffer areas for titles.
00002850Each of these buffer areas can be set for even page only, odd pages only, or for all pages.
00002860The control words .TT, .BT, .ET, .OT, .EB and .OB are used to set title lines into the buffer areas.
00002870The number of title lines that will be printed at the top and bottom of a page is determined by the .HS and .FS control words.
00002880If a heading space of 1 is in effect (this is the default value), one top title will be printed at the top of each page.
00002890.h2 Controlling pagination;.ke Pagination_
00002900Script provides you with many facilities for controlling the pagination of your document.
00002910You may suppress page numbering altogether or just on output, cause the numbering to be in Arabic or lower case Roman,
00002920and reset page numbers within a document.
00002930.h2 Example of Page Setup and Formatting
00002940This example is based on one shown in the Announcement Notice for Script/370 (Form G320-1520-0).
00002950Since the margin settings are not specified, they assume the default values.
00002960The text itself will be formatted with lines justified at the left and right margins since that is the default mode of output.
00002970The page-eject function causes the top title to print on the first page.
00002980.br;Terminal input:

00003320.bx off;.ds;.in 0;.rm 0;.ce off;.h2 Text Formatting
00003330Script gives you many choices as to the appearance of your final text.
00003340The control words described in the previous section give you the facilities for determining the overall dimensions and relative
00003350positions of the different elements of the page: text, top and bottom titles, margine etc.
00003360The control words described in _t_h_i_s section allow you to determine exactly
00003370how your body text is to appear within the margins.
00003380.sp;The seven basic text formats are:
00003390.nj;.ss
00003400.sp;.of 3;1. Justified - even left and right margins.
00003410.sp;.of 3;2. Ragged right - even left margin, uneven right margin.
00003420.sp;.of 3;3. As-is - output line corresponds exactly to input line regardless of margins.
00003430.sp;.of 3;4. Right-adjusted - even right margin, uneven left margin.
00003440.sp;.of 3;5. Centered - equidistant from both margins.
00003450.sp;.of 3;6. Out-justified - right adjusted on even numbered pages, left on odd.
00003460.sp;.of 3;7. Columns - similar to the typical newspaper, dictionary or phone-book, the textual material can be formed into multiple columns.
00003470.ds;.of 0;.ju;.h2 Justified Text;.ke _Justify
00003480Script justifies your text by inserting blanks as needed between words until the line length you have specified is filled.
00003490In CONCATENATE-JUSTIFY mode, Script obtains words from the next line until no more words can be placed on the line
00003500without exceeding the line length.
00003510It then inserts blanks as needed to fill out the line.
00003520If the input line is too long to fit within the output line length,
00003530Script removes words from it and spills them into the next input line, and fills the first line with blanks as needed.

00003800.h2 Line Spacing
00003810Script provides you with three control words that allow you to determine spacing between lines of body text.
00003820Using these control words, you can cause double- or single-spacing, or cause a given number of blank lines
00003830to be inserted between two lines of text so that, for example,
00003840illustrations can be introduced in the reproduction copy of your document.
00003850.se ab='';.h2 Page Spacing;.ke Pagination
00003860Frequently, you may require a new page to be started even though space may remain on the current page.
00003870Conventionally, new sections or chapters begin on new pages, for example.
00003880You may want to insert an illustration that will not fit in the space remaining on the current page,
00003890or you may deliberately want a blank page so that the back-up page (reverse-side) can be removed from your document.
00003900Script provides four control words so that you can cause a new page to be started under such circumstances.
00003910Three of these control words also include control of page numbering for the page to be started.
00003920.se ab='';.h2 Margin Modification;.ke _Margin
00003930In preparing a document, you will probably require that the location of the effective left margin be changed
00003940from time to time.
00003950You may require that certain paragraphs be indented from the left margin, that certain text be printed with hanging indent,
00003960or that a block of formatted text be centered.
00003970Script provides four control words that simplify these tasks for you.
00003980With them you can specify indent amounts, temporary additions or subtractions from the indent, and tab stops.
00003990These are described below.
00004000.se ab=.im;.h2 Incorporating Other Files;.ke File
00004010When developing long documents, or documents that you expect to revise frequently,
00004020it is good practice to establish a number of individual Script files that each contain a separate portion of your document.
00004030For instance, each chapter could be a separate file, and your keyboard-developed illustrations could be kept
00004040in a file of their own.
00004050Then, using the control words described in this section,
00004060you can establish a _m_a_s_t_e_r _f_i_l_e that combines the individual sections in any order you require.
00004070.sp;In this way, you can reorganize your document if necessary, and add to it or delete from it with a minimum of effort.
00004080Different master files can be established so that different versions of your document can be printed simply
00004090by referring to the appropriate master file, without having to maintain separate (duplicate) files.
00004100This conserves storage space and relieves you of the necessity of making sure that changes
00004110are incorporated into duplicate files.

00004410.sp;Script provides you with five control words that permit you to combine files in different ways.
00004420add a file to the end of another file,
00004430and assure that a file is not inserted into another until a new page is begun in the receiving file.
00004440.h2 Preserving File Status
00004450When you cause another file to be included in your output by use of the IMBED or DELAY-IMBED control words,
00004460the setup values of the imbedded files remain in effect after the return to the receiving file until new control words
00004470are encountered.
00004480Often, this is undesireable.
00004490For instance, if the file you imbedded used double-spacing, it remains in effect for the remainder of the file in which you
00004500imbedded it, even though you have specified single-spacing at some point before the IMBED.
00004510You could prevent problems of this kind by keeping track of all your setup values and entering the appropriate control words
00004520to reset them after each IMBED or DELAY-IMBED, but this would be extremely inconvenient.
00004530Frequently, it is difficult to know what the original settings were.
00004540.sp;To prevent this problem Script provides you with two control words that relieve you of the necessity to keep track of
00004550the values in effect at the time of the IMBED or DELAY-IMBED.
00004560The SAVE-STATUS control word causes Script to store the values;
00004570the RESTORE-STATUS control word allows you to put them back into effect.
00004580.se ab=;.h2 Additional Facilities
00004590Script includes many facilities for increasing the usability of your document in both final and unformatted form.
00004600Through the control words described in this section, you can:
00004610.ss;.nj
00004620.sp;.of 3;¤  conveniently underscore sets of text by any of several mothods
00004630.sp;.of 3;¤  establishes a topic heading and table of contents scheme
00004640.sp;.of 3;¤  produce automatic keywording and indices
00004650.sp;.of 3;¤  support selective viewing of sections
00004660.sp;.of 3;¤  cause selective printing of anything from a single word to an entire document
00004670.sp;.of 3;¤  indicate as many as nine different revision codes at the left margin
00004680.sp;.of 3;¤  cause characters entered from the terminal to be translated when your document is to be printed offline
00004690.sp;.of 3;¤  cause lines beginning with a period (.) to be treated as literal text rather than as control words
00004700.sp;.of 3;¤  include comments that will not appear in the final document
00004710.sp;.of 3;¤  change the symbol used to separate successive control words that are entered on the same line

00005770.h2 Multiple Column Processing;.ke _Columns
00005780Perhaps one of Script's most useful features is its ability to produce multiple-column output.
00005790Using the various multiple-column control words, you can determine the number of columns per page, their width and separation,
00005800and whether all columns on a page are to be the same length (balanced) or the last column will be allowed to be shorter
00005810than the others (unbalanced).
00005820Using these control words, you can produce output with as many as nine columns per page.
00005830This allows you to produce double-column output similar to that of many technical manuals,
00005840six- or eight-column output similar to that of most newspapers,
00005850or other formats which may be of special use in your installation.
00005860.sp
00005870For most users the separate .CD and .CL are cumbersome,
00005880thus it is recommended that Script set-symbol macros be used instead.
00005890For example, the symbol "&1col" could be assigned to mean "enter 1 column format"
00005900and "&2col" mean "enter 2 column format".
00005910.sp;By creating an initialization file, named "$COLUMN" for example, which contains:
00005920.ss;.sp;.in 6;.nf;.li 7
00005930.cw ?
00005940.pl 84
00005950.cd 2 0 46
00005960.se 1col = '.cd 1;.cl 89;'
00005970.se 2col = '.cd 2;.cl 43;'
00005980.cw ;
00005990.su on
00006000.ds;.fo;.in 0;You can create text files using COLUMN, as follows:
00006010.ss;.sp;.in 6;.nf;.li;.im COLUMN

00006100.ds;.sp;.fo;.in 0;WARNING: The Page-Length (.PL) should never be changed except when in one column mode,
00006110as is true at the very beginning of the Script file.
00006120.sp;Also, the ADJUST parameter to Script should only be used with very small explicit nn values
00006130since "standard" double column format takes 89 characters, leaving very little extra space on the line.
00006140.h2 Terminal Input and Output
00006150Using the terminal input/output control words you will find Script very useful for form letters
00006160with variable information such as name and address, questionaires,
00006170and making one-shot changes to documents. Script provides you with two control words
00006180that cause it to accept input from a terminal during output processing,
00006190and one that causes it to print information at the terminal that will not be processed as part of your document.
00006200.h2 Set Symbol Facilities
00006210The set-symbol facilities of Script in conjunction with the SUBSTITUTE-SYMBOL control word and the TWOPASS option
00006220of the Script command provide an extremely powerful method of generating tables of contents,
00006230assigning section numbers, and defining shorthand symbols to substitute for special phrases or control word sequences.
00006240You use the SET-SYMBOL control word to define a symbol and the name of the value to be substituted for it.
00006250You use the SUBSTITUTE-SYMBOL control word to determine whether the current value is substituted for the symbol
00006260in a given portion of your document.
00006270Thus you could define a symbol called chap1 with a value of & (pagenumber).
00006280Later, in your table of contents, you could type in chap1 as the page number associated with the heading of Chapter 1.
00006290Script would then substitute the actual page number for the symbol.
00006300Many more involved applications of these facilities are possible,
00006310but they are all based on the type of action described above.
00006320Additional details describing the set-symbol facilities are in Appendix &APPB..
00006330.h3 Using Set Symbols
00006340The page numbers in a table of contents or an index change each time a document is revised.
00006350The use of set-symbols can make such changes automatic.
00006360Suppose you are creating a table of contents.
00006370You should first define all the items which will be specified in the table of contents, and then,
00006380associate each with a set-symbol name preceded by an & character. For example:
00006390.ss;.sp;.nf
00006400     Chapter 1 . . . . . . &chapter1
00006410     Chapter 2 . . . . . . &chapter2
00006420     Chapter 3 . . . . . . &chapter3
00006430.ds;.sp;.fo;In order for Script to substitute the assigned page numbers for the set-symbol names, you must specify substitute-mode.
00006440Put the following control words at the top and bottom of your table of contents, respectively:
00006450.ss;.sp
00006460     .substitute-symbol on
00006470        .
00006480        .
00006490        .
00006500     .substitute-symbol off
00006510.ds;.sp;Now you must assign values to the set-symbols you have defined.
00006520The character &, when used alone, represents the current page number of the formatted output.
00006530For example, at the point in the Script file where chapter 2 begins, you must include a SET-SYMBOL control word
00006540which assigns to the name &chapter2 the current page number, as:
00006550.ss;.sp
00006560     .page-eject
00006570     .space-lines 2
00006580     CHAPTER 2. THE DOUBLE TASK OF LANGUAGE
00006590     .set-symbol chapter2=&
00006600     .space-lines 2
00006610.ds;Note that when substitution is desired, you reference "&chapter2",
00006620but in the SET-SYMBOL control statement, you reference "chapter2".
00006630Note also that Script would regard chapter2 and Chapter2 as different set-symbol names.
00006640.sp;The section of this document titled _E_X_A_M_P_L_E shows some ways in which set symbols can be used in formatting a rep
00006650In the example both the table of contents and the figure numbers are set up with set symbols.
00006660Referto the first half of the example, the unformatted report, to see the Script control words used.
00006670.sp;Some documents start each paragraph three spaces in from the left margin.
00006680The typist can use the space bar or tab key to accomplish this, or,
00006690with the following control words in effect, could issue &p at the beginning of each new paragraph:
00006700.ss;.sp
00006710     .set-symbol p='   '
00006720     .substitute-symbol on
00006730.ds;.sp;Note that use of &p within the text of a document makes the convention of three spaces easy to change.
00006740Another use of set symbols permits text files to be switched from single to double column format easily.
00006750In a file called COLUMN are:
00006760.ss;.sp
00006770     .control-word-separator ?
00006780     .column-definition 2 0 46
00006790     .line-length 89
00006800     .set-symbol 1col='.cd 1;.cl 89'
00006810     .set-symbol 2col='.cd 2;.cl 43'
00006820     .control-word-separator
00006830.ds;.sp;The main text file, which must not issue any .cd control words, would contain the following for single column mode:
00006840.ss;.sp
00006850     .imbed column
00006860     &1col

00011960.sc;.of 0;.h1 Compatibility with Other Versions;.mc
00011970Ryan Script was intended to be "upwards compatible", with relation to a series of text processing systems:
00011980.sp;.in 5;Script  (CP67/CMS)
00011990.ss;FORMAT  (OS/TSO)
00012000.br;Script  (VM/CMS, versions 1,2 and 3)
00012010.ds;.in 0;.sp 2;The meaning of this euphemistic sounding phrase is merely that any file processable under one of these packages
00012020will also process properly under Ryan Script. This is not___ to say that all features that are available
00012030in Ryan Script are also available in the others.
00012040In fact, Ryan Script is intended as a "proper superset" of each of the above.
00012050Some of the facilities available only to Ryan Script are:
00012060.sp
00012070     ¤  complete, controlled hyphenation
00012080     ¤  numeric set symbols, with fractions
00012090     ¤  line density control
00012100     ¤  keyword indexing
00012110     ¤  unlimited arguments to .imbed
00012120     ¤  up to 20 columns
00012130     ¤  unlimited, nested boxes
00012140     ¤  selective viewing
00012150     ¤  up to 10 topic head levels

00012210Additional Information Regarding SET-SYMBOL and SUBSTITUTE-SYMBOL Control Words.
00012220There are several special reserved symbols that are automatically initialized, each time Script is used,
00012230to the current values for: year (SYSYEAR), month (SYSMONTH), day of year (SYSDAYOFY), day of month (SYSDAYOFM),
00012240day of week (SYSDAYOFW), hour of day (SYSHOUR), minute of hour (SYSMINUTE), and seconds of minute (SYSSECOND).
00012250These symbols are tabulated below:
00012260.sc;.ss;.sp 2;.bx 1 &$ll;.h6 Reserved Set Symbols;.bx
00012270.in 2;.rm 2;.tr # TAB;.tb 14 33;Symbol#Meaning#Example of value

00012300.of 30;SYSDAYOFY#day of year#If this is Feb. 8, 1971 (39th day of the year), SYSDAYOFY has the value _0_3_9.
00012310.of 30;SYSDAYOFM#day of month#If this is Feb. 8, 1971, SYSDAYOFM has the value _0_8.
00012320.of 30;SYSDAYOFW#day of week#If this is Monday, Feb. 8, 1971, SYSDAYOFW has the value 2_ (Sunday is considered the 1st__ day of the week).
00012330.of 30;SYSHOUR#hour of day#If it is 7:30 P.M., SYSHOUR has the value _1_9 (24 hour clock, 7:30 A.M. would have the value 07
00012340.of 30;SYSMINUTE#minute of hour#If it is 7:30 P.M., SYSMINUTE has the value _3_0.
00012350.of 30;SYSSECOND#seconds of minute#If it is 7:30:15, SYSSECOND has the value _1_5.
00012360.of 30;SYSVAR#user defined#Optionally supplied in the invoking Script Command.
00012370.ke SYSDATE;.of 30;SYSDATE#date of run#A convenient form of the date: mm/dd/yy.
00012380.ke SYSCOUNT;.of 30;SYSCOUNT#running counter#This equals 1 on the first reference, 2 on the second, etc.
00012390To use multiple counters, it may be subscripted (1) up to (10); no subscript corresponds to (0).
00012400.of 30;SYSLINE#line number#This equals the current formatted output line number (caution: since a break is not automatic, it may lag).
00012410.bx off;.sp 2;.mc;.in 0;.rm 0;.ds;.ju;.of 0;The table above only indicates the initial values of the symbols.
00012420Although they may be changed and used exactly as regular set symbols, it is not recommended.
00012430.sp;.cp 9;Each symbol has a fixed size value field.
00012440If its current value is less than the field size, leading zeroes are provided (e.g.,
00012450SYSDAYOFY was 039 above, not just 39).
00012460The leading zeroes can be easily removed by a Script control word such as:
00012470.su off
00012480.sp;     .SE SYSDAYOFY = &SYSDAYOFY
00012490.sp;since leading zeroes are automatically deleted after an arithmetic evaluation.
00012500.sp;The numeric values of the special symbols can be converted to other forms as shown in the following example:
00012510.ss;.sp;.in 5;.nf;.li 4;.se m01=January
00012520...
00012530.se m12=December
00012540.se alphamonth = &m&SYSMONTH
00012550This is now &alphamonth already.
00012560.ds;.su on;.in 0;.sp;.fo;The above sequence would result in the line: "This is now February already." if the current date was Feb. 8, 1971.
00012570The beginning of the sequence defines a sequence of set-symbols, m01, m02, ..., m12,
00012580whose values correspond to the alphabetic representation of the 12 months.
00012590The expression "&m&SYSMONTH" involves a double substitution; first it becomes "&m02" and then "February".
00012600A very similar technique can be used to convert the days of the week to their alphabetic equivalents
00012610(e.g., Monday instead of 2).
00012620.sp;There is another group of symbols containing the Script internal values.
00012630The actual two character code may be expressed in upper or lower case.

00012830.ds;.sc;.h1 Inclusion of Non-Textual Sections;.mc
00012840It is not uncommon that a document would contain both textual and non-textual materials.
00012850Non-textual materials are those that cannot be stored in a file nor processed by Script.
00012860Examples are: drawings, photographs, fold-outs, elaborate charts, classified sections etc.
00012870These materials are often grouped together and called "Graphics".
00012880Treatment varies with requirement and "taste". Some suggestions follow:
00012890.sp;Suppose your document is to consist of several major parts, and that one of the parts has been classified to a point prohibiting computer tele-processing.
00012900The classified part, even if it is textual, must be treated separately as though it were "graphic".
00012910If each part is to be represented in a separate file or to be page numbered independantly (from 1), then no problem exists.
00012920But within a total file, with contiguous page numbering, an appropriately valued .pa +n control line must be entered at the point where the classified part is to be subsequently placed.
00012930.sp;The greatest incidence of graphic inclusion involves short sections, from partial pages to a few pages.
00012940The tactic always requires a preliminary size estimate of the piece and some decision as to where and how it should be located.
00012950.ke .cp .di;Since it is not usually accepted to have a page break within such a piece, either a .cp or a .di must be used to avoid it.
00012960The .cp approach dictates that the piece is to be located immediately with the possible exception of a page eject if sufficient space does not remain on the current page.
00012970The .di approach means that the piece is to be inserted immediately following the current page;
00012980this is typical for a fold-out or full page illustration.
00012990Of course, either of the above will be followed by any necessary spacing, labelling etc.
00013000This is also a convenient place to insert Graphic Arts log numbers, to be subsequently overlaid
00013010by the so-retrieved art piece.
00013020Desire to squeeze a picture into a partial page, left-to-right,
00013030can be accommodated by .in, .of, .kp and/or .ll control lines.
00013040.sp;A document containing graphics is often augmented by one or more additional tables of contents
00013050(figures, tables, plates, exhibits etc.).
00013060.ke .h6;This is usually accomplished through use of the higher level topic heads.
00013070For instance, all figures could be tagged by appropriate .h6 control lines, then following the normal
00013080table of contents, the user could disable the contents entries for levels 0-3, enable level 6 and insert .tc again.

00013160.ds;.sc;.h1 Information Retrieval Techniques;.mc
00013170Ryan Script offers several methods by which the user may selectively view desired sections of a document.
00013180This is, of course, in addition to the ordinary dataset and member access by name through TSO.
00013190.h3 Page Selection
00013200If the user knows the actual, desired page numbers within the completed document,
00013210one or more ranges of pages can be requested via the PAGE option to the Script Command.
00013220These page numbers are usually the "external" type (as seen) but can be "internal".
00013230Subsequent selection is available through PAGE(PROMPT).
00013240.h3 Topic Selection
00013250If the Script file has been constructed using topic heads,
00013260the TOPIC option can be supplied with the Script Command to retrieve one or more of the so described sections.
00013270.h3 Conditional Sections
00013280.ke .cs;Through use of conditional sections (.cs),
00013290selected portions throughout a document can be defined as "belonging" to numbered conditional sections.
00013300These may overlap freely and are independant of topic heads.
00013310Subsequently, the output document can be formatted and printed by including and/or ignoring any combination
00013320of these sections.
00013330.ke .rv SYSVAR;This can be conveniently automated by use of the SYSVAR option or the .rv control line.
