This Data Set contains a modification that allows a User to log
onto a secondary Job Entry Subsystem.  For Systems before MVS/SP 1.3.3
or MVS/XA 2.1.1, it also allows directing a Started Task to  a
secondary JES.

Note:  This modification alone will not accomplish logging onto a
secondary JES.  It only updates the necessary control blocks to
accomplish the task.  The TSO LOGON JCL must contain the name on
the secondary JES to log onto.  This is most easily accomplished
via the LOGON Pre-Prompt Exit.

This modification has been previously published in the GUIDE JES2
Newsletter.
