)F Function -
  The INSTREAM command is used to create 80-byte control
  card images in a temporary file.  This command can be run
  under CLIST control, with symbolic substitution of
  variables allowed.

)X Syntax -

      INSTREAM   DDNAME(name)  END(string)  CAPS  NOTIFY
      IN           FILE(name)               ASIS  NONOTIFY

  REQUIRED - none
  DEFAULTS - DDNAME(SYSIN) END(END) CAPS NOTIFY
  ALIAS    - IN

)O Operands -

))DDNAME(name) -
             Name of the temporary file where the data will
             be stored.
             DEFAULT:  DDNAME(SYSIN)

))FILE(name) -
             Means the same thing as DDNAME.
             DEFAULT:  FILE(SYSIN)

))END(string) -
             The character string which will signal the end
             of data.  When this character string is entered
             at the beginning of a line, with nothing
             following, INSTREAM will treat it as an end of
             file mark.
             DEFAULT:  END(END)
                NOTE:  When using INSTREAM to enter data
                       from a terminal, or variable blocked
                       CLIST, a null line will also be
                       treated as an end of file mark.

))CAPS -
             Indicates that all alphabetic data entered from
             a keyboard should be shifted to upper case.
             CAPS is the opposite of ASIS.
             DEFAULT:  CAPS
                NOTE:  CAPS applies to the string in the
                       END operand.

))ASIS -
             Indicates that all alphabetic data entered from
             a keyboard should remain in whatever case it was
             in when it was typed.
             ASIS is the opposite of CAPS.
             DEFAULT:  CAPS
                NOTE:  ASIS applies to the string in the
                       END operand.

))NOTIFY -
             When INSTREAM completes, NOTIFY directs it to
             put out an 'OPERATION COMPLETE' message.
             NOTIFY is the opposite of NONOTIFY.
             DEFAULT:  NOTIFY

))NONOTIFY -
             When INSTREAM completes, NONOTIFY will suppress
             the writing of an an 'OPERATION COMPLETE'
             message.
             NONOTIFY is the opposite of NOTIFY.
             DEFAULT:  NOTIFY

))EXAMPLES -
    1.  Create the following control card images in a file
        called SYSIN:
                  PRINT MAXNAME=1,MAXFLDS=1
                  NAME=PAYROLL1
                  RECORD FIELD=(20,,,80)

        INSTREAM
          PRINT MAXNAME=1,MAXFLDS=1
          NAME=PAYROLL1
          RECORD FIELD=(20,,,80)
        END

    2.  Do the same thing as in Example 1, but make the name
        a variable in a CLIST.

        PROC 1 PROGRAM
        INSTREAM
          PRINT MAXNAME=1,MAXFLDS=1
          NAME=&PROGRAM.
          RECORD FIELD=(20,,,80)
        END

    3.  Do the same thing as in Example 2, but put the data
        into a file named SYSUT1.

        PROC 1 PROGRAM
        INSTREAM  DDNAME(SYSUT1)
          PRINT MAXNAME=1,MAXFLDS=1
          NAME=&PROGRAM.
          RECORD FIELD=(20,,,80)
        END

)M Messages -
))The following messages are issued by the INSTREAM command.

))INS0000I - INSTREAM OPERATION COMPLETE
           Normal completion of the INSTREAM command.

))INS0004E - UNABLE TO ALLOCATE OUTPUT FILE/DD NAME
           The file named in the FILE or DDNAME operand is
           unavailable.  Use the FREE command to free the
           file, or LOGOFF then LOGON again.

))INS0008E - UNABLE TO OPEN OUTPUT FILE
           System problem.  The output file is allocated to
           a temporary dataset which cannot be opened.  (If
           the output file name is SYSIN, the output dataset
           name is &&SYSIN.  The file name and dataset name
           will match.)

))INS000CE - UNABLE TO CLOSE - OUTPUT FILE
           This will usually be preceeded by some other problem.
           LOGOFF to force the file to close.

))INS0010E - UNABLE TO READ DATA FROM TERMINAL OR CLIST
           Probably caused by a hardware or communications
           problem.  Try again.  If the problem persists,
           ask for systems programming support.
