This dataset contains several TSO commands developed for the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts under contract by Chuck Hoffman.
All the command processors are reenterable, reusable, and
refreshable.  They may be placed into SYS1.LPALIB, SYS1.LINKLIB,
or any of the libraries on the LNKLST, such as SYS1.CMDLIB.

All of these commands are fully in production at our installation.
They are currently running on an IBM-3033 and Amdahl-5860 under
MVS 3.8, SP1.3.2, IPO/J.

The contents of this dataset are:

A.  Command processors:
    DSNCHECK - Checks for a catalog entry for a dataset name.
               Optionally checks for a member name in a PDS.
               Great for CLISTs.  Uses IKJEHCIR and the BLDL SVC.
    FREEALL  - Not the same old FREEALL.  This is a new one which
               uses SVC-99, so this FREEALL can be maintained by
               a more junior programmer.  Has nice operands,
               including 'EXCEPT' for providing a list of file
               names (or masks) which you do not want to free.
    INSTREAM - Creates a temporary file on SYSDA from keyed in
               data, or from instream data in a CLIST.  Is the
               equivalent of JCL 'DD *'.  Symbolic substitution
               can be used.  Excellent for CLISTs executing
               utilities which require control cards.  Better
               than other methods, such as using EDIT during
               CLIST execution, because of using system-assigned
               names, VIO (if available on SYSDA), and not having
               to use cataloging.  Uses SVC-99 and QSAM.
    LIBCALL  - Executes programs in the system areas, or in
               private libraries, or both.  The user does not
               need to know exactly which library the program is
               in.  Similar to 'CALL' and 'XCTL', but has an
               optional 'STEPLIB' operand.  The 'STEPLIB'
               concatenation will be searched ahead of system
               areas for the main program, and other programs
               which may be dynamically loaded at execution time
               (such as graphics routines).  LIBCALL also can
               accept program parms in lower case via the 'ASIS'
               operand.  Uses ATTACH SVC.  Especially good for
               group or system CLISTs.
    SYSDSN   - Creates a list of JOB/TSU/STC names which
               have a dataset allocated, or are waiting for
               allocation.  Uses the GQSCAN SVC.

B.  Macros:
    Our version of the GTE Laboratories macros for linkage
    conventions and dynamic allocation via SVC-99 (available in
    another file on the mods tape).  LINKSAVE and LINKBACK now
    have a 'GETAMT' operand for the GETMAIN.
        LINKSAVE            GTEDADAT
        LINKBACK            GTEDASET
        EQ$R                GTEDAALC
        GTEDADOC

C.  HELP members:
    Help members for the TSO commands.  (HELP for the GTE dynamic
    allocation macros is obtained by assembling macro GTEDADOC.)
        #DSNC               #LCALL
        #FA                 #SYSD
        #IN

D.  JCL:
    The jobstreams we ran for installation.  SMP was not used
    for these commands.  Access to the CVT macro in SYS1.AMODGEN
    is required for all assemblies.
        @DSNC               @LCALL
