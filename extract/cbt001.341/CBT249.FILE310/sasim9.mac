%                      The SAS/SPF OUTPUT MENU
+        As  you  can  see, this menu gives you the ability to get a
+     hardcopy  of your SAS program's output; use SPF Browse to look
+     at  the output; route output to a plotter; and edit/rerun your
+     program.
+
+        To  get  out  of this menu when you are finished looking at
+     the  output,  printing  it,  testing your program, etc., press
+     PF3.
+
%     SAS OUTPUT OPTION 1 - BROWSE
+
+     Option 1 is the default SPF output option.  If you press ENTER
+     as  soon  as  the Output Menu appears, you will browse the SAS
+     program  output.  If there is no output (the output dataset is
+     empty)  then  nothing will happen.  Unfortunately, there is no
+     easy  way  to  test  for  this  condition;  you  will  have to
+     recognize the symptoms when this occurs.
