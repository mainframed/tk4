+        Enter  in  the  name  of  the  library  that you would like
+     allocated.   Once  you  enter in this name, press ENTER.  Look
+     for  the  message  "ALLOCATION  COMPLETE";  once this appears,
+     press  ENTER  again.   In  the  future,  system  security  may
+     disallow access to some of these libraries.
+
+        The  message  "Last  Panvalet  Library Allocated Was ....."
+     may  be  incorrect. The name here is only an indication of the
+     name  that  you last chose when you entered this menu.  If you
+     have logged off in the meantime, this name may be misleading.
+
+        Once you change the Panvalet Library with this menu, any
+     Panvalet datasets that you retrieve, add, or update will reside
+     on this library unless you logoff or change libraries with this
+     menu.
