%USER NUMBER
+
+     You  can  change  the  user  number associated with a Panvalet
+     dataset  with  the  Option  "U".   Enter  in  the  name of the
+     Panvalet  dataset  and select option "U".  Next, enter in the old
+     user  number  of the dataset.  Move the cursor over to the new
+     user  number of the dataset and fill it in.  Thus you have the
+     ability  to  change  control  over a Panvalet dataset when you
+     take over a new job.
+
%OTHER PANVALET COMMANDS
+
+     Panvalet  has  a  few  other commands available to you.  These
+     include Copy; Level; Allocate; Attach; Detach; and Reseq.  See
+     the  Panvalet  manual if you wish to use one or more of these.
+     These  commands  are  very  infrequently used and thus are not
+     described here.
