%     PROGRAM SPECIFICATION
+     There  are  three  ways  to  tell  SPF the name of the SPF/TSO
+     dataset  that contains your SAS program statements.  The first
+     is through the "Project/Library/Type" fields.  Project is your
+     userid;  Library  is  the descriptive name of the program; and
+     Type  should  be  "data".  This field may be already correctly
+     filled  out  if you last used SPF Edit to create your program.
+     A  second  way is by entering in the name in the "Other Partitione
+     or  Sequential  Dataset".   If  you wish to run someone else's
+     program,  enter  the  dataset  name in quotes, including their
+     userid.     For     example,     you     might     enter    in
+     'BE001AA.SASPROGM.DATA'.   If  the dataset belongs to you, you
+     need  not  enclose  it  in single quotes and you must omit the
+     userid  from  the  dataset  name.   Finally,  if  you  wish to
+     interactively enter in SAS programming statements without them
+     being  remembered,  enter  in  an asterisk (*) for the dataset
+     name.
