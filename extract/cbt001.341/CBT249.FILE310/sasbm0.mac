%TUTORIAL------------- SAS - SPF BATCH INTERFACE -----------------------
%NEXT SELECTION ===>_OPT      +
+
+     Menu B contains the SAS Batch Interface.  It essentially runs
+     the same as the SAS Interactive interface, except that it submits
+     a batch run to the job scheduler (JES2) to execute SAS when it
+     has time to do so.  There is no time limit on your batch job
+     while there is a 15 second limit on interactive SAS jobs.
+
+     The SAS batch interface frees up your terminal to perform other
+     editing or SPF functions while the job is running.  Once your
+     program finishes execution, you can view the output with SPF
+     menu 3.8 or queue the output directly to paper.
+
+     This menu is thus useful for a) routine jobs; b) long running
+     SAS jobs; and c) freeing up your terminal for other tasks.
