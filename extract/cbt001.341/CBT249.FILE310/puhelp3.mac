%DELETING THE DATASET AFTER UPDATING
+        If  you  would  like to delete your TSO/SPF dataset after
+     adding, type in  a YES after the message "DO YOU WANT TO DELETE
+     THE DATASET AFTER UPDATING ON PANVALET?".  This allows
+     you  to  keep  track  of those datasets on the TSO system that
+     have  been  updated on  Panvalet.   It  leaves  no "junk" lying
+     around.   Remember,  if  you do not delete it, the TSO nightly
+     SCRATCH  procedure will if you do not have the dataset name in
+     your TSOLEAVE dataset. "NO" is a recommended value since
+     the advantage to not deleting it is that a backup copy will be
+     made of it from both TSO and Panvalet; if one should fail, you
+     still have the other to recover from.
+
%RESULTS
+        When  your  update completes, the results will be displayed
+     in  the  field labelled "results".  Look for "*** ABOVE ACTION
+     SATISFACTORILY  COMPLETED".   If  it  does  not appear, try to
+     determine your error.  SPF will try and guess the cause of the
+     failure,  but  you  must  ultimately  figure  it out yourself.
+     After successful update, you can enter in new parameters to
+     update another dataset, or press PF3 to end the update menu.
