%LETTER TO IDENTIFY YOUR JOB
+   This is a letter of the alphabet to uniquely identify your batch
+   job to the system.  A batch job is identified by a "job name"
+   which consists of your userid followed by a letter.  In order to
+   keep your records straight as to which batch job is performing
+   which task, you can assign a different letter to each one.
+   The default is "S".  Multiple jobs with the same jobname and
+   jobname character are delayed from executing; two jobs running
+   simultaneously cannot have the same name.  The second does not
+   start running until the first completes execution.
