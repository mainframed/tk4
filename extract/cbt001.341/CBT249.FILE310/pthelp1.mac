+        Type  in  the  names  of  the  datasets that you would like
+     restored  one by one.  After each dataset name press the ENTER
+     key.   the message "ENTER PANVALET DATASET NAME OR PRESS ENTER
+     ->"  will appear each time that you press the ENTER key.  When
+     you are finished entering in Panvalet dataset names, press the
+     ENTER  key  without  pressing  any  other  key.  A job will be
+     submitted in your name which simply adds these names to a list
+     of  other  names  to  be  restored.   At  night,  another  job
+     (program) runs which reads this list and restores the datasets
+     from  the  inactive  tape.  If you already have a dataset with
+     the same name on the active library, the restore will not take
+     place.   If  you  have changed Panvalet libraries someone from
+     the  other  library system may have to run the library restore
+     for  you.   Panvalet  tape  restore  only remembers and cannot
+     change the default library from the time that you logon.
