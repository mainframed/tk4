+
+     On  the  SAS menu  several items appear allowing you to change
+     some  SAS  defaults.   The  first of these is the "Sortsize in
+     Cylinders'.  The default here is 4 cylinders.  A cylinder is a
+     measurement  of  disk drive space.  One cylinder is 30 tracks;
+     one  trace  is 19069 characters.  SAS will tell you the number
+     of  observations  that  it  can place on a track.  Knowing the
+     number  of  observations  in  a  SAS dataset, divide it by the
+     number  of OBS/TRACK to give the number of tracks required.  Divid
+     this  number by 30 to obtain the number of cylinders required.
+     Also note that SAS requires approximately double the size of a
+     SAS  dataset  for  sorting  and merging datasets.  Thus if you
+     need  to,  you  can  compute  how much space required for your
+     Sortsize and for your work dataset.  The default give you 2.25
+     million  characters  of  sort  space  and 1/2 million for work
+     datasets.
