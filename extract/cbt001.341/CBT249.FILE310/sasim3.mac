%LINESIZE
+        The  default  output linesize is set to 132 characters.  If
+     you  do  not  like to scroll sideways when viewing the output,
+     this can be set to 76 characters.  Also, if you are formatting
+     a  report  for  a special size paper, you might wish to change
+     the size.
+
%OTHER OPTIONS
+        Under  "Other  Options",  you  can  specify any option that
+     appears  in  the  SAS User's Guide appendix that describes the
+     options.
+
%FILE SPECIFICATIONS
+     There  are several types of files: workfiles, input files, and
+     output  files.   A  workfile  is a permanent SAS dataset; this
+     stores  your  intermediate  "DATA  name;"  steps and saves the
+     computation   time   needed   to  recreate  these.   Permanent
+     workfiles are best used for large SAS datasets.  If you have a
+     previously  created  workfile and want to use it for this run,
+     specify the dataset name here.  The name can be specified with
+     the  normal  TSO  naming convention:  you do not need to enter
