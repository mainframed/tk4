+
+     Option  3 is used for Versatec plot output and Calcomp output.
+     It  is not needed for the IBM 3287 color printer.  If you have
+     specified     "OPTIONS     DEVICE=VERSATEC"     or    "OPTIONS
+     DEVICE=CALCOMP"  in  your program, use this option to initiate
+     the  plotting.  The idea behind this option is to allow you to
+     first  interactively  debug  your plot with the IBM 3279 color
+     terminal and then request a hardcopy.
+
+        Remember,  Versatec  and  Calcomp plotters will only handle
+     the  output of one SAS/GRAPH plotting procedure at a time.  If
+     you  use several PROC GPLOT/GCHART's in your program, you must
+     use  the  GOUT=  option on your procedures and PROC GREPLAY to
+     request  multiple  graphs.   This is documented in a SAS/GRAPH
+     User's Summary written by J. Oleksiw.
