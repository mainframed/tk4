+
+
+     The Panvalet Menu Option "D" can be used to find out the names
+     of  the  Panvalet datasets that you have currently residing on
+     the  active Panvalet library.  You can interrogate the library
+     directory  by your user number; by dataset name; or by part of
+     a dataset name.  This display does not show any  dataset names
+     that  are  on  the  Panvalet  inactive tape (use Panvalet Menu
+     Option  "H"  for this).  If you have used TSO before SPF, this
+     menu corresponds to the TSO command DISPAN or DP.
+
+        You  can  request  a  display  in  two ways: first, dataset
+     information; and secondly, dataset comments.  The name, status
+     codes, date of last access, date of last update, dataset type,
+     revision level, and number of statements are shown in response
+     to  your  query  if  you request a display of Panvalet dataset
+     information.   Only  the Panvalet name and comment is shown if
+     you request a display of dataset comments.
