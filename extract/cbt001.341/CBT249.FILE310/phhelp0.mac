+     Panvalet has an option to allow you to get a listing of all of
+     your  Panvalet  datasets.   This list contains all datasets on
+     the active library and those on tape.  This listing is updated
+     only  on  Friday  nights,  so those datasets that you updated,
+     deleted, or added during the week will not be included on this
+     listing.  You can browse this listing or get a hardcopy of it.
+     To  obtain  this  listing,  select  option "H" on the Panvalet
+     Interface Menu.
%
+        Enter  in  your Panvalet user number.  Next, enter in a "B"
+     to  only  use  SPF  Browse  to look at the listing or enter in
+     either a "D" or "H" to get a hardcopy.
%
+        For  hardcopy,  most  users  will use Destination=Local and
+     Print  class=A.   Those users at remote locations will have to
+     know which printer type they have available and its name.
+
+        If you enter Browse to look at the listing, you can use all
+     of  the  SPF  Scroll commands to examine the listing.  You may
+     have  to  use  PF11  to  scroll right since the listing is 132
+     columns wide.  Use PF3 to end the Browse function.
