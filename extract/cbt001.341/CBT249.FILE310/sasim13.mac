%     SAS OUTPUT OPTION 4 - EDIT/RERUN
+     This  option  puts you into the control of SPF Edit and allows
+     you  to edit your SAS program.  If you go into edit and do not
+     make  any changes, you will return to this menu when you press
+     PF3  to end.  If you do make changes to your program, SAS will
+     rerun your program when you end SPF edit with PF3.
+
+        Session  Manager  users  may  note that they do not go back
+     into  Session  Manager.  There is a "bug" with SPF which stops
+     him  from  going  back  into  Session  Manager  on  the second
+     execution.
+
%     SAS OUTPUT OPTION 5 - EDIT ONLY
+     This  option  will put you into SPF Edit without rerunning the
+     SAS program when completed.   This might be useful if you need
+     to  go  into a split screen mode to edit your data.  You might
+     also  want to make a change and then end SPF SAS without going
+     through  the  time-consuming  rerun process.  Press PF3 to end
+     the SPF Edit of your program.
