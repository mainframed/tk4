%     INTRODUCTION TO PANVALET
+
+     Panvalet is a long term data storage system.  A dataset on SPF
+     has  a limited lifetime of 1 day.  To keep your data, you must
+     add  your dataset to the Panvalet system, or take advantage of
+     a  system called TSOLEAVE, which is documented earlier in this
+     manual.  Panvalet provides many benefits to you.  Every night,
+     a copy is made of every dataset on Panvalet; this copy is kept
+     for  one week.  Once a week, another copy is made of Panvalet;
+     this  copy  is  kept for a month.  Every month another copy is
+     made  of  every  dataset  on Panvalet; this copy is kept for a
+     year.   If  you  make  a mistake and destroy or overlay one of
+     your  Panvalet  datasets,  you should be able to get a back-up
+     copy  of this Panvalet dataset restored by calling ECS Systems
+     at 5236.
