+     SPF SAS INTERFACE - PRIMARY MENU OPTION "S"
+
+
+     SPF  has  an  interface  into  the Statistical Analysis System
+     (SAS)  through  menus written here at NUSCO ECS. If you have
+     questions,  problems,  or suggestions for improvement for these
+     menus, please call Jim Oleksiw.
+
+        These menus make it easy for a SAS user to run his program ,
+     view the output, and get a hardcopy.  Naturally, if you do not
+     know the SAS computer language, these menus will be of no use to
+     you;  you  may  as  well skip reading this section.  If you do
+     know  SAS,  look  at  the  SAS  menu and then explain what you
+     should put into each of the fields.
