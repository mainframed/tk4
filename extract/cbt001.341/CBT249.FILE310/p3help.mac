%     PANVALET USER NUMBERS
+
+     Users  of  the TSO system are assigned a TSO userid.  Users of
+     the  Panvalet system are assigned a number - the Panvalet user
+     number.  This number is used to identify all of your datasets.
+     You  can  get  listings  of  all datasets "owned" by a certain
+     Panvalet  number.   Panvalet  numbers  are  assigned  by Carol
+     Sedgwick  of  ECS  Systems.   Give her a call to get one; make
+     sure  that  you  write  down this number and keep track of it.
+     You  will  make  frequent  reference  to  it  when you use the
+     Panvalet system.
