%OTHER FULLY QUALIFIED DATASET NAME
+
+        The  final  section  of  the screen is normally left blank.
+     This  is under the field "Other Fully Qualified Partitioned or
+     Sequential   Dataset  Name".   However,  this  gives  you  two
+     abilities.   The  first  is  that  you  can enter in a dataset
+     different  from  the  current  Project, Library, and Type.  In
+     this case, just enter the middle part of the dataset name in
+     the "DATASET NAME" field, and enter the type of dataset in the
+     "DATASET TYPE" field (DATA, CNTL, TEXT, etc).
+
+     You  need  not enter your userid in front of the dataset name.
+
+     You may also add to PANVALET a dataset that does not belong to you
+     If  you wish to add a dataset that is not your own or contains
+     a  2  or  four  level  name,  enter the entire dataset name in
+     quotes.   For example, use 'BE001BB.SAMPLE.DATA'.  On the line
+     below, enter the dataset type.  It must be the TSO/SPF type of
+     data.  If this dataset is a PDS, then simply
+     enter the member name on the line labelled "Member Name".
