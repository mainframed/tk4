%TUTORIAL-------------PANVALET - SPF PRIMARY MENU OPTION "P"------------
%NEXT SELECTION ===>_OPT      +
+        Menu  "U", Update, is used to update or replace an existing
+     Panvalet  dataset  with  an  updated  copy from SPF/TSO.  This
+     performs the same function as the TSO command "Panupd".
+
+        Menu "G" is used to maintain your Panvalet datasets: add or
+     change a description/comment of them; rename them; assign them
+     to another user; mark them for deletion from the library; mark
+     the  dataset  to  be rolled off the active library to tape; or
+     change the format description of the dataset.
+
+        Menu  "D",  Display,  provides  a  listing of the names and
+     statistics about your Panvalet datasets that are on the active
+     library.   This  is  the  SPF  equivalent  of the TSO commands
+     "Discom" and "Dispan".
+
+        Menu  "M",  Modify,  enables  you to change the name of the
+     Panvalet  library that you are accessing: for example, if your
+     Panvalet  library  is  the  System  Planning  library and your
+     friend  from  the Nuclear section has a set of data for you to
+     look  at,  you  can  switch libraries and browse that dataset.
+     This is the SPF equivalent of the TSO command "Panin".
