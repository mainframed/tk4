%FORMAT
+     The  format  of  the  Panvalet  dataset indicates the Panvalet
+     "type"  -  is  it  data, assembler, Fortran, PL/1, job control
+     language,  or  object code? If you added a dataset to Panvalet
+     with  the  wrong "Panvalet type" in the Panvalet Add menu, you
+     can change it by entering in the correct format here.  Consult
+     the  table  under the Panvalet Add description for the correct
+     Panvalet  type  field.  Enter in the Panvalet name, a Panvalet
+     code  of  "F",  and  after  the "New Format", the new Panvalet
+     format field.  Press the ENTER key and look for the results to
+     appear.  After they appear, press the ENTER key again to clear
+     up the menu.

%COMMENT
+     To  change  or  add a comment to an existing Panvalet dataset,
+     select  option  "C"  - comment. Enter the name of the Panvalet
+     dataset  to  be  commented.   Move  the  cursor  down  to  the
+     "comment"  line  and  type  in  a  description of the dataset.
+     Press  the  ENTER  key  and  look  for the results.  When they
+     appear, press the ENTER key again to clean up the menu.
