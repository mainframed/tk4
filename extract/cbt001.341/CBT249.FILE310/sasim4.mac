+     the  userid  or  enclose  the  dataset  name  in quotes if the
+     dataset  name begins with your id.  If the workfile belongs to
+     someone  else,  enclose the dataset name in quotes (') and put

+                   specify:  SAS.WORKFILE
+                   your id is BE001ZZ; workfile name is
+                   BE001AA.SAS.WORKFILE
+                   specify: 'BE001AA.SAS.WORKFILE'
+
+        If you use the INFILE statement, specify the name after the
+     INFILE  keyword  in the "FILE" section of the menu.  Enter the
+     dataset  name to be read in the "DATASET" portion of the menu.
+     Enter  "SHR"  for  the  disposition.  "SHR" shares the dataset
+     with  other  users  and batch jobs that you might run.  If you
+     wish  to type in your input directly from the keyboard without
+     going  to  a dataset, enter in "*" for the dataset name.  This
+     input mode is stopped by entering in a "/*" from the keyboard.
