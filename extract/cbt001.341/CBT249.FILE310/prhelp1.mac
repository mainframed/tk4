%OTHER FULLY QUALIFIED PARTITIONED OR SEQUENTIAL DATASET NAME:
+     If  you wish to specify another name of a dataset, you may do so
+     under  "Other  Partitioned or Sequential Dataset".  Be sure to
+     specify  the  type of the dataset as well as the name.  You need
+     not enter your userid, only the dataset name under "NAME" and
+     the type after "DATASET TYPE" (ie, DATA, CNTL, TEXT, VSBASIC).
+
%BLOCK SIZE
+     Block size is the number of 80 character records combined together
+     to form a "block". 6080 is an efficient value for our system.
+     It is on the menu for some special users who need another size.
+
%MAXIMUM NUMBER OF LINES
+     Type in the number of lines in the dataset to be retrieved.
+     You may successfully retrieve a dataset up to 3400 lines without
+     entering in the value on this line.  However, if the dataset is
+     fairly large, enter in the approximate number of lines in the
+     dataset.  This reserves the proper amount of space on the disk
+     storage unit for the dataset.
