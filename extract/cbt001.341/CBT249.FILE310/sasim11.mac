%                      The SAS/SPF OUTPUT MENU
+        You  can  obtain  microfiche output by specifying the local
+     printer  and  an  "Output  Class" of "F".  For rotated output,
+     specify "OPTIONS LINESIZE=90 PAGESIZE=58" in your SAS program;
+     select the LOCAL printer and an "Output Class" of "8".
+
+        The menu item "keep output dataset after printing" will not
+     delete  the  dataset  after your SAS run is complete.  You can
+     add  onto  the  end  of  this  dataset  by  keeping  it.   The
+     recommended  value for this item is "NO"; you may add onto the
+     end  of it and not remember that you are doing this.  This can
+     be very confusing when you examine the results.
+
+        One word of caution - if you use the "FILE PRINT" statement
+     in  your  programs  with  "PUT"  statements,  add  the keyword
+     "print"  onto  the  FILE  statement to correctly establish the
+     characteristics  of  the  printing  file.   The correct way to
+     specify  this  is "FILE PRINT PRINT;". The second word "PRINT"
+     may  seem  redundant  but  it  is necessary for the successful
+     generation of hardcopy.
