%PANVALET USER NUMBER
+        Under  the  field "User Number", simply enter your Panvalet
+     number.   Make  sure  that  you  get it correct; otherwise you
+     might lose the dataset.
+
%PANVALET COMMENT
+        The  "Comment" field is a description of the dataset.  This
+     will  help  you  to  remember what the dataset is if you don't
+     access  it  for  a period of time.  Up to 52 characters can be
+     supplied  to  describe  the  dataset.   The Panvalet directory
+     displays will display this comment for you.
+
%SPF PROJECT, LIBRARY, AND TYPE
+        The  "Project",  "library",  and  "type"  fields  are entered a
+     before.  They may even have the correct values in them, as SPF
+     remembers  the  last  dataset  accessed  with  Edit or Browse.
+     Remember,  Project usually corresponds to your Userid; Library
+     is the name of the dataset that you were editing; and type is,
+     of  course,  the type of data for the name of the dataset. (If
+     you   were  working  with a PDS, specify the member name under
+     the "member" field.
