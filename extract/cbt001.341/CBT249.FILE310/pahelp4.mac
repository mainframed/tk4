%DELETING THE DATASET AFTER ADDING
+        If  you  would  like to delete your TSO/SPF dataset after
+     adding, type in  a YES after the message "DO YOU WANT TO DELETE
+     THE DATASET AFTER ADDING TO PANVALET?".  This allows
+     you  to  keep  track  of those datasets on the TSO system that
+     have  been  added  to  Panvalet.   It  leaves  no "junk" lying
+     around.   Remember,  if  you do not delete it, the TSO nightly
+     SCRATCH  procedure will if you do not have the dataset name in
+     your TSOLEAVE dataset.
+     The advantage to not deleting it is that a backup copy will be
+     made of it from both TSO and Panvalet; if one should fail, you
+     still have the other to recover from.
+
%RESULTS
+        You  should  look for five lines appearing in the "Results"
+     part  of  the  screen  when the Panvalet addition is complete.
+     Look for the line "***** Above Action Satisfactorily Completed
+     ****"  after a "++ADD name,type,usercode" line and another one
+     after  a  "++COMMENT  name,description" line.  If these do not
+     appear,  a  series of diagnostic and error messages will alert
+     you.   When the "results" appear, you are ready to add another
+     dataset to PANVALET.
