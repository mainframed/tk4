%     THE SPF PANVALET INTERFACE
+
+     The  SPF  Panvalet library interface as described here is only
+     in  use  at NUSCO ECS and is not documented in any IBM Manual.
+     Although  Panosophic Systems, the makers of Panvalet, wrote an
+     interface  to  TSO, ECS chose to write their own.  If you have
+     made  use of the PAN/SPF product, be aware that it is not used
+     at NUSCO ECS.
+
+        There  is a manual available about Panvalet from Panosophic
+     Systems;  you  may obtain a copy from ECS.  However, virtually
+     everything  that  you  need  to  know  is in this tutorial and
+     the SPF/TSO INTRODUCTORY GUIDE.
