+     The  Status  entry  allows you to delete a Panvalet dataset or

+     code of%"S"+under the "Panvalet code" field.

+     To delete the dataset, enter a Panvalet status of%DISABLE
+
+     To  Roll  the  dataset  off to tape, enter a status code of
+    %INACTIVE
+
+     To prevent dataset updating, enter a status code of%PROD

+     Note  that  the  original dataset status is%ENABLE+(keep on
+     the  library); %ACTIVE+ (do  not  roll  off to tape); and%TEST+

+     INACTIVE  do  not  occur  until  Friday  nights  when disabled
+     datasets  are  deleted and inactive datasets are rolled off to
+     tape.   This  gives  you  the  opportunity to change your mind
