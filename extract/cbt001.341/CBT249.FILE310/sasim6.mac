%GRAPHICS OUTPUT DEVICE SPECIFICATION
+
+     If you use SAS/Graph, you can specify the ultimate destination
+     for  your  output  on  the  line  "OPTIONAL SAS/GRAPH HARDCOPY
+     DEVICE".   Valid options here are: VERSATEC - for the Versatec
+     12"  black and white electrostatic plotter;  CALCOMP - for the
+     Calcomp  36"  three color pen plotter; TEK - for the Tektronix
+     4014/4015  terminal;  and  IBM3287  -  for  the IBM four color
+     plotter.   VERSBIG is the 35" black and white Versatec plotter
+     in  Berlin;  VERSCTY  is  the  22"  plotter in the Conn Yankee
+     Planning  and  Scheduling  office; and VERSMP1 is the Versatec
+     22"  plotter  in the Millstone Planning and Scheduling office.
+     For large volumes of output, the Versatec is recommended.  You
+     may  route  your  output  to the IBM 3279 color terminal first
+     with  an  OPTIONS  DEVICE=IBM3279  statement  in your program.
+     When  your  plot  looks  good,  change  this statement in your
+     program  and  rerun  it.   The  IBM 3279 color terminal is the
+     default graphics device.
