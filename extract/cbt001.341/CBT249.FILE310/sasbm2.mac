%ESTIMATED CPU TIME
+   Estimate the amount of time that your program will spend executing.
+   CPU time is the actual computation time, while execution time is
+   wall clock time.  CPU time is always less than wall clock time since
+   the computer is always doing computations for many jobs and TSO
+   users simultaneously.
+
+   Those jobs that use the smallest amount of CPU time are given
+   priority.  Your job priority is based on the amount of time that
+   you estimate.  The ranges are:
+    ---Time--------------  Priority
+    01-5  seconds            1
+    06-15  "                 2
+    15-59  "                 3
+    1  minute - 3 minutes    4
+    3  minutes +             5
+
+   If your job quits with a 322 return code, or you see the message
+   ERROR: TIME EXCEEDED at the end of your SAS run, increase your
+   time estimate.
