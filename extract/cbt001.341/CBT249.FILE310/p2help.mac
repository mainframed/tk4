+        Datasets  on  Panvalet  that  are not accessed for about 90
+     days  are  rolled off to tape.  This means that if you need to
+     get back an infrequently accessed dataset, you should check to
+     be  sure  that  it  is  still  on  the active Panvalet library
+     (you'll  see  how  later)  and  if  not, enter in a command to
+     restore it from the tape.
+
+        After  adding  your  dataset  to Panvalet, you can retrieve
+     your  dataset from it; update this dataset; print it; find out
+     the  names  of  your  datasets  and their descriptions; rename
+     them;  delete  them; roll little used datasets off to tape and
+     retrieve  them; and obtain a hardcopy of your Panvalet dataset
+     names.
