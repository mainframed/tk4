%TUTORIAL-------------PANVALET - SPF PRIMARY MENU OPTION "P"------------
%NEXT SELECTION ===>_OPT      +
+        Menu  "P",  Print,  will  get  you a hardcopy printout of a
+     Panvalet  dataset or allow you to use SPF Browse to look at it
+     without actually issuing a Panvalet Retrieve.  This is the SPF
+     equivalent of the TSO command "Panlist" or "Panprint".
+
+        Menu  "T",  Tape,  gives  you the ability to specify that a
+     Panvalet  dataset  on  tape  will  be  restored  to the active
+     library.   This  is  the  SPF  equivalent  of  the TSO command
+     "Restpan"
+
+        Menu  "H",  Hardcopy,  provides  a  hardcopy  printout  of  you
+     Panvalet  directory.   It contains a list of all your datasets
+     both  on the active library and on the inactive tape.  You can
+     also browse this directory before you get a hardcopy.  This is
+     the SPF equivalent of the TSO command "Pandir".
+
+        If  you get into this menu and wish to end it, press PF3 as
+     you would for any other menu.  To branch directly to another
+     menu, you may type '=' followed by the menu number, and press
+     PF4.

%       This concludes the Panvalet-SPF general information tutorial.
