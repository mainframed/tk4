%TUTORIAL-------------PANVALET - SPF PRIMARY MENU OPTION "P"------------
%NEXT SELECTION ===>_OPT      +
+     This  menu  provides  a  complete SPF/TSO interface to Panvalet.
+     Remember, SPF is just a tool to edit and access TSO  datasets.
+     Thus  any  dataset that you previously maintained with the TSO
+     Edit  command  you can maintain with the SPF Edit Menu.  Also,
+     any TSO dataset that you previously accessed with the existing
+     PANRET,  PANADD,  and  PANUPD TSO commands you can access with
+     these  SPF Panvalet Menus.  Any Panvalet datasets that you had
+     prior to using SPF can be accessed through SPF.  (New users of
+     SPF/TSO can just ignore this discussion).

%     PANVALET OPTION DESCRIPTIONS
+
+        Menu  "A",  Add,  is  used to add an SPF/TSO dataset to the
+     Panvalet  library  system. This is the same as the TSO command
+     "Panadd".
+
+        Menu "R", Retrieve, is used to copy a Panvalet dataset from
+     the  active  Panvalet library back to the SPF/TSO system. This
+     performs the same function as the TSO command "Panret".
