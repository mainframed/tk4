%TUTORIAL ------------------- ADD TO PANVALET FROM SPF -----------------
%     PANVALET MENU OPTION P.A - ADD          NEXT SELECTION ==>_OPT
+
+     This  menu  allows  you  to  add  a  dataset  to Panvalet from
+     TSO/SPF.   It  will  copy the dataset to Panvalet and give you
+     the  option  of  deleting  the  copy on TSO/SPF if it is added
+     successfully.
+
+      This is  simply  a  "fill  in  the  blanks" operation.
+
%PANVALET NAME
+
+        In  the  field  "Panvalet  Name",  make  up a name for your
+     dataset  to  be called on the Panvalet library.  It can be the
+     same  as  its name on TSO/SPF.  You should end the name of the
+     dataset  with  your  Panvalet number; this insures that no two
+     names  are  alike.   Thus  if  the  name of your TSO/SPF dataset i
+     SAMPLE.DATA  and  your  user  number is 500, the Panvalet name
+     would  become  SAMPLE500.  The total length of a Panvalet name
+     can  be  up to ten characters or numbers.  If you use an eight
+     character  TSO  name, you may have to chop off the last letter
+     to get your Panvalet number onto the end.
