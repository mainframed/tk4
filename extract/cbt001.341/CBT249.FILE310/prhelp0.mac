%TUTORIAL ------------- RETRIEVE A DATASET FROM PANVALET TO SPF --------
%PANVALET MENU OPTION P.R - RETRIEVE       NEXT SELECTION ==>_OPT
+
+     The  Panvalet  Retrieve  Menu is reached by entering an option
+     "R"  from the Panvalet Interface Menu.  This does the opposite
+     of  the  Panvalet  "Add"  menu;  it  retrieves  a dataset from
+     Panvalet  and  writes  it to an SPF/TSO dataset.
+
%PANVALET NAME
+        Fill  in  the name of the Panvalet dataset that you want to
+     retrieve.   For  example, you might enter SAMPLE500 if you had
+     previously added this to Panvalet.
+
%SPF PROJECT, LIBRARY, AND TYPE
+        Under the SPF library field, enter in the Project, Library,
+     and type.  "Project" should be your TSO Userid.
+     The "Library" field should be the name of the dataset that you
+     want to create. SPF tries  to   create   the   dataset   named
+     Project.Library.Type  on  TSO;  if it exists already, the menu
+     will  fail.   If  you  have a PDS, the PDS must exist already,
+     however;  SPF will not create one for you.  In the case of the
+     PDS you must specify a member name.
