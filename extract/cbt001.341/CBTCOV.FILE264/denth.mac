)F FUNCTION -
  THE DENT COMMAND IS USED TO CREATE OR MODIFY SEQUENTIAL DATA SETS OR
  MEMBERS OF PARTITIONED DATA SETS.  THE CARD IMAGES MUST BE FIXED
  LENGTH, 80 BYTE RECORDS, AND THE DATA SET MAY BE NO LARGER THAN
  APPROXIMATELY 12,000 RECORDS.
 +NOTE THAT WHILE UNDER THE DENT COMMAND, YOUR SESSION WILL NOT BE
  CANCELLED IF YOUR TERMINAL IS IDLE FOR 30 MINUTES.
 +NOTE THAT HELP CAN BE ENTERED UNDER DENT EITHER AS A SUBCOMMAND
  TO FIND OUT ABOUT OTHER SUBCOMMANDS OF THE DENT COMMAND (FIND,
  TOP, BOTTOM, ETC.), OR AS A MAJOR COMMAND TO FIND OUT ABOUT OTHER
  MAJOR COMMANDS (PLI, LISTC, LISTDS, ETC.).  WHILE UNDER DENT, IF
  YOU ARE NOT CURRENTLY IN XMODE (SEE HELP DATA FOR THE X
  SUBCOMMAND), AND YOU ENTER "HELP" IN THE COMMAND AREA (WITH OR
  WITHOUT OPERANDS), DENT ASSUMES THE HELP SUBCOMMAND, AND WILL GIVE
  YOU SUBCOMMAND HELP DATA.  ONCE THE HELP DATA HAS BEEN
  DISPLAYED, DENT WILL PUT YOU IN XMODE.  IF YOU HAVE ENTER XMODE
  IN THIS FASHION, UNTIL YOU RETURN TO SCAN MODE, ANY HELP COMMANDS
  YOU ENTER ARE ASSUMED TO BE REQUESTS FOR SUBCOMMAND DATA.  IF YOU
  ENTER XMODE VIA THE X SUBCOMMAND, ANY HELP COMMANDS YOU ENTER ARE
  ASSUMED TO BE REQUESTS FOR MAJOR COMMAND DATA.

  REQUIRED - 'DSNAME'
)O OPERANDS -
  'DSNAME' - NAME OF THE DATA SET TO BE CREATED OR EDITED.
   IF THE FULLY QUALIFIED DATA SET NAME IS SPECIFIED, IT MUST
   BE ENCLOSED IN SINGLE QUOTES. IF THE DATA SET NAME IS NOT
   ENTERED WITHIN QUOTES, THE USERID IS ALWAYS APPENDED TO
   THE LEFT OF THE NAME. IF THE RIGHTMOST QUALIFIER IS NOT
   ENTERED BY THE USER, ONE WILL BE APPENDED FOR HIM.  IF
   MORE THAN ONE DATA SET EXISTS WITH THE SPECIFIED NAME,
   THE USER WILL BE PROMPTED TO SELECT THE APPROPRIATE QUALIFIER.
  NOTE - THE DENT COMMAND WILL ENQUEUE ON THIS DATA SET, DISP=OLD,
   UNLESS THE OUTPUT OPERAND IS SPECIFIED, IN WHICH CASE IT WILL
   ENQUEUE DISP=SHR.
))OUTPUT() - THIS KEYWORD SPECIFIES AN OPTIONAL OUTPUT DATA SET
   INTO WHICH THE EDITED DATA WILL BE WRITTEN WHEN A SAVE SUBCOMMAND
   IS ISSUED WITHOUT A DSNAME OPERAND.  IF THE FULLY QUALIFIED DATA
   SET NAME IS SPECIFIED, IT MUST BE ENCLOSED IN SINGLE QUOTES.
   IF THE DATA SET NAME IS NOT ENTERED WITHIN QUOTES, THE USERID
   IS ALWAYS APPENDED TO THE LEFT OF THE NAME.  IF THE RIGHTMOST
   QUALIFIER IS NOT ENTERED BY THE USR, ONE WILL BE APPENDED FOR
   HIM IF THE OUTPUT DATA SET ALREADY EXISTS.  IF
   MORE THAN ONE DATA SET EXISTS WITH THE SPECIFIED NAME,
   THE USER WILL BE PROMPTED TO SELECT THE APPROPRIATE
   QUALIFIER.  IF NO DATA SETS EXIST WITH THE SPECIFIED NAME,
   ONE WILL BE CREATED.
))PANEL() - THIS KEYWORD SPECIFIES AN OPTIONAL LOAD LIBRARY DATA SET
   CONTAINING LOAD MODULES CREATED BY THE SCRDEF COMMAND (SEE
   ELSEWHERE).  THESE LOAD MODULES REPRESENT USER DEFINED DISPLAY
   PANELS TO BE USED DURING THE EDIT.
=PANEL=P
)F FUNCTION -
  THE PANEL SUBCOMMAND IS USED TO SPECIFY A DISPLAY PANEL TO BE USED
  TO FORMAT DATA ON THE SCREEN.  THE DESCAN PANEL IS
  THE NORMAL DEFAULT PANEL WHEN THE EDIT IS FIRST ENTERED.

  DEFAULT  - NONE
  ALIAS    - P
)O OPERANDS -
 'PANEL-NAME' - IS THE NAME OF A PANEL TO BE DYNAMICALLY LOADED.
   IF THE FIRST TWO CHARACTERS OF THE PANEL NAME ARE 'DE', THEN
   THE PANEL NAME REFERS TO A STANDARD PANEL (STANDARD PANELS CAN BE
   USED WITHOUT SPECIFYING A PANEL OPERAND ON THE DENT COMMAND).
   CURRENTLY, ONLY
   TWO STANDARD PANELS, DESCAN AND DEASM, ARE DEFINED.  DESCAN IS
   ALWAYS THE FIRST PANEL USED TO DISPLAY DATA UNDER THE DENT
   COMMAND (LOGICALLY, YOU MAY CONSIDER THAT THE SUBCOMMAND
   "PANEL DESCAN" IS AUTOMATICALLY ENTERED FOR YOU AT ENTRY TO THE
   DENT COMMAND).  DEASM IS A PANEL FORMAT DESIGNED FOR ENTERING
   ASSEMBLER SOURCE STATEMENTS.
 'NUMBER' - IF A SINGLE NUMBER IS ENTERED IN THE COMMAND FIELD,
   THEN IT IS ASSUMED TO BE AN IMPLICIT PANEL SUBCOMMAND.  THE
   NUMBER SPECIFIES THE PANEL NUMBER IN THE ORDER IN WHICH PANELS
   WERE INITIALLY REFERENCED BY EXPLICIT PANEL SUBCOMMANDS.
   IF YOU ENTERED "1" FOR EXAMPLE, YOU WOULD BE INDICATING THAT YOU
   NOW WANT DATA DISPLAYED UNDER THE DESCAN PANEL.

             DATA SET IS USED, OR THE SAVE COMMAND WAS PREVIOUSLY
             ISSUED SPECIFYING A DSNAME, IN WHICH CASE THAT DATA SET
             IS USED.
  ALIAS    - SF, SB, SE, SX
  NOTE     - THE ALIAS SE IS
             EQUIVALENT TO ENTERING A SAVE SUBCOMMAND FOLLOWED BY THE
             END SUBCOMMAND.
  NOTE     - THE ALIAS SX IS EQUIVALENT TO ENTERING A SAVE SUBCOMMAND
             FOLLOWED BY THE X SUBCOMMAND.  THE RESULT IS THAT AFTER
             THE SAVE HAS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED, THE TERMINAL IS
             PLACED IN X MODE (SEE THE X SUBCOMMAND).
  NOTE     - SAVE MUST BE ISSUED IF THE USER WANTS TO RETAIN A NEW DATA
             SET CREATED BY THE EDIT COMMAND, OR TO INCORPORATE INTO AN
             OLD DATA SET CHANGES MADE UNDER DENT.  YOU WILL NOT BE
             PROMPTED IF YOU ENTER THE END SUBCOMMAND BEFORE SAVING
             ANY CHANGES YOU HAVE MADE.

           + SPECIFIES AN EXISTING SEQUENTIAL DATA SET OR PDS MEMBER
             DIFFERENT FROM THAT SPECIFIED WITH THE EDIT COMMAND, THE
             DATA SET WILL BE REUSED, AND WILL BECOME THE DEFAULT
             FOR THE NEXT SAVE SUBCOMMAND.
           + SPECIFIES A DATA SET WHICH DOES NOT ALREADY EXIST, A NEW
             SEQUENTIAL DATA SET WILL BE ALLOCATED.
   IF THE FULLY QUALIFIED DATA SET NAME IS SPECIFIED, IT MUST BE
   ENCLOSED IN TRIPLE QUOTES (E.G. '''SYS2.PROCLIB(AU109209)''').
   IF THE DATA SET NAME IS NOT ENTERED WITHIN QUOTES, THE USERID
   IS ALWAYS APPENDED TO THE LEFT OF THE NAME.  IF THE RIGHTMOST
   QUALIFIER IS NOT ENTERED BY THE USER, ONE WILL BE APPENDED FOR
   HIM IF THE OUTPUT DATA SET ALREADY EXISTS.  IF
   MORE THAN ONE DATA SET EXISTS WITH THE SPECIFIED NAME,
   THE USER WILL BE PROMPTED TO SELECT THE APPROPRIATE
   QUALIFIER.  IF NO DATA SETS EXIST WITH THE SPECIFIED NAME,

   LINE1      - SPECIFIES THE FIRST LINE IN THE RANGE TO BE
                MOVED.  IF THERE IS NO LINE IN THE
                DATA SET WITH THIS LINE NUMBER, THEN THE RANGE
                BEGINS WITH THE NEXT LOWER NUMBER FOR WHICH
                A LINE EXISTS IN THE DATA SET.

   LINE2      - IF 3 LINE NUMBERS ARE SPECIFIED, LINE2
                SPECIFIES THE LAST LINE IN THE RANGE TO BE
                MOVED. IF THERE IS NO LINE IN THE
                DATA SET WITH THIS NUMBER, THE RANGE ENDS WITH
                THE LINE HAVING THE LARGEST NUMBER LESS THAN
                THE NUMBER SPECIFIED.  IF ONLY 2 LINE NUMBERS
                ARE SPECIFIED, LINE2 IS THE LINE NUMBER FOLLOWING
                WHICH THE SINGLE LINE SPECIFIED BY LINE1 IS TO

   LINE3      - SPECIFIES THE LINE FOLLOWING WHICH THE MOVED LINE(S)
                WILL BE PLACED. IF THIS NUMBER SPECIFIES A LINE WHICH
                DOES NOT EXIST IN THE DATA SET, THEN THE MOVED LINE(S)
                WILL BE PLACED FOLLOWING THE LINE WITH THE NEXT LOWER
                LINE NUMBER. THE MOVED LINE(S) WILL BE RESEQUENCED
                INCREMENTING BY 1.  FOLLOWING LINES IN THE DATA SET
                WILL AUTOMATICALLY HAVE THEIR NUMBERS CHANGED AS
                NEEDED TO ACCOMMODATE THE NEW LINES.  ONLY THE
                MINIMUM NUMBER OF LINES WILL BE RENUMBERED.
                THE DEFAULT INCREMENT FOR MOVED LINES IS THE
                CURRENT INCREMENT. THE INCREMENT FOR ANY

             IN THE RANGE OF LINES.  IF THE STRING CONTAINS EITHER
             BLANKS OR COMMAS, IT MUST BE CONTAINED IN QUOTES.
             NOTE THAT THE SYNTAX FOR THIS SUBCOMMAND IS NOT THE
             SAME AS THAT FOR THE CHANGE SUBCOMMAND OF EDIT.
             "C * 9999 /HOW/NOW/" UNDER EDIT, FOR EXAMPLE, WOULD BE
             ENTERED AS "C * 9999 HOW NOW" UNDER DENT.  THE OTHER

)F FUNCTION -
  USE THE HELP SUBCOMMAND TO OBTAIN INFORMATION ABOUT OTHER DENT
  SUBCOMMANDS.  THE SYNTAX IS IDENTICAL TO THE HELP SUBCOMMANDS
  FOR EDIT, OPER, AND TEST.
 +NOTE THAT HELP CAN BE ENTERED UNDER DENT EITHER AS A SUBCOMMAND
  TO FIND OUT ABOUT OTHER SUBCOMMANDS OF THE DENT COMMAND (FIND,
  TOP, BOTTOM, ETC.), OR AS A MAJOR COMMAND TO FIND OUT ABOUT OTHER
  MAJOR COMMANDS (PLI, LISTC, LISTDS, ETC.).  WHILE UNDER DENT, IF
  YOU ARE NOT CURRENTLY IN XMODE (SEE HELP DATA FOR THE X
  SUBCOMMAND), AND YOU ENTER "HELP" IN THE COMMAND AREA (WITH OR
  WITHOUT OPERANDS), DENT ASSUMES THE HELP SUBCOMMAND, AND WILL GIVE
  YOU SUBCOMMAND HELP DATA.  ONCE THE HELP DATA HAS BEEN
  DISPLAYED, DENT WILL PUT YOU IN XMODE.  IF YOU HAVE ENTER XMODE
  IN THIS FASHION, UNTIL YOU RETURN TO SCAN MODE, ANY HELP COMMANDS
  YOU ENTER ARE ASSUMED TO BE REQUESTS FOR SUBCOMMAND DATA.  IF YOU
  ENTER XMODE VIA THE X SUBCOMMAND, ANY HELP COMMANDS YOU ENTER ARE
  ASSUMED TO BE REQUESTS FOR MAJOR COMMAND DATA.
