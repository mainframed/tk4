)O OPERANDS
))VOLSER - IS THE VOLUME SERIAL OF THE DISK VOLUME.
))ADD -  YOUR CHOICE BETWEEN THE KEYWORDS ADD, CHANGE, AND DELETE
    INDICATES TO THE COMMAND PROCESSOR WHETHER RECORD OF A VOLUME IS
    TO BE ADDED, CHANGED, OR DELETED.
))CHANGE -  YOUR CHOICE BETWEEN THE KEYWORDS ADD, CHANGE, AND DELETE
    INDICATES TO THE COMMAND PROCESSOR WHETHER RECORD OF A VOLUME IS
    TO BE ADDED, CHANGED, OR DELETED.
))DELETE -  YOUR CHOICE BETWEEN THE KEYWORDS ADD, CHANGE, AND DELETE
    INDICATES TO THE COMMAND PROCESSOR WHETHER RECORD OF A VOLUME IS
    TO BE ADDED, CHANGED, OR DELETED.
))TYPE - INDICATES THE TYPE OF DIRECT ACCESS DEVICE.  THE
    CHOICES ARE 2314, 3330, 3330-1, AND 3350.  THE DEFAULT IS 3330.
))TRK - USED TO INDICATE THE TOTAL NUMBER OF TRACKS AVAILABLE FOR
    ALLOCATION ON THE VOLUME.  THE DEFAULT ARE 4060 FOR TYPE(2314),
    7676 FOR TYPE(3330), 15352 FOR TYPE(3330-1), AND 16650 FOR 3350.
))OLDVOL - THIS PARAMETER IS USED ONLY IF CHANGE IS SPECIFIED.
    IT IS USED IF A GIVEN VOLUME IS CLIPPED FROM ONE VOLUME SERIAL
    TO ANOTHER.  FOR EXAMPLE, IF OSD401 IS CLIPPED TO OSD403, THEN
    THE FOLLOWING COMMAND SHOULD BE ENTERED:  NEWVOL OSD403
    OLDVOL(OSD401).
))DAILY - DATA SETS WITH A FREQUENCY OF DAILY WILL BE ACCEPTED.
))WEEKLY - DATA SETS WITH A FREQUENCY OF WEEKLY WILL BE ACCEPTED.
))MONTHLY - DATA SETS WITH A FREQUENCY OF MONTHLY WILL BE ACCEPTED.
))REQUEST - DATA SETS WITH A FREQUENCY OF REQUEST WILL BE ACCEPTED.
))RESIDENT - DATA SETS WITH A FREQUENCY OF RESIDENT WILL BE ACCEPTED.
))OFFLINE - DATA SETS WITH A FREQUENCY OF OFFLINE WILL BE ACCEPTED.B
))LOCAL - DATA SETS WHICH ARE USED BY JOBS WHICH ARE SUBMITTED LOCALLY.
))REMOTE - DATA SETS WHICH ARE USED BY JOBS WHICH ARE SUBMITTED
           REMOTELY.
))NDAILY - REMOVE THE FREQUENCY SPECIFICATION DAILY.
))NWEEKLY - REMOVE THE FREQUENCY SPECIFICATION WEEKLY.
))NMONTHLY - REMOVE THE FREQUENCY SPECIFICATION MONTHLY.
))NREQUEST - REMOVE THE FREQUENCY SPECIFICATION REQUEST.
))NRESIDEN - REMOVE THE FREQUENCY SPECIFICATION RESIDENT.
))NOFFLINE - REMOVE THE FREQUENCY SPECIFICATION OFFLINE.
))NLOCAL - REMOVE THE FREQUENCY SPECIFICATION LOCAL.
))NREMOTE - REMOVE THE FREQUENCY SPECIFICATION REMOTE.
))NULLFREQ - SPECIFIES THAT ALL FREQUENCY SPECIFICATIONS FOR
     THE VOLUME ARE TO BE ELIMINATED.
))CHG - USE THIS KEYWORD TO SPECIFIY DEFAULT DIVISION AND DEPARTMENT
     CODES FOR BILLING PURPOSES.  IF YOU ENTER A VALUE, IT MUST BE
     FIVE DECIMAL DIGITS, THE FIRST TWO BEING THE DIVISION CODE, AND
     THE LAST THREE BEING THE DEPARTMENT CODE.  THE DEFAULT FOR THIS
     KEYWORD IS 00000.  WHEN THE BI-WEEKLY DISK SPACE MANAGEMENT BATCH
     JOB IS RUN (AU109856), AND AN UNAUTHORIZED DATA SET IS FOUND
     (ONE FOR WHICH A REQSPACE COMMAND HAS NOT BEEN ISSUED),  IF THE
     CHG KEYWORD FOR THE VOLUME IS 00000, THE DATA SET WILL BE
     SCHEDULED FOR DELETION.  OTHERWISE, PROVIDING THE DISK SPACE IS
     AVAILABLE, A REQSPACE COMMAND WILL BE ISSUED AUTHORIZING THE
     DATA SET WITH THE DIVISION AND DEPARTMENT CODES SPECIFIED IN THE
     CHG KEYWORD FOR THE VOLUME.  THIS MEANS THAT THE SPECIFIED
     DIVISION AND DEPARTMENT WILL BE CHARGED FOR THE SPACE.
))BDAILY() - SPECIFIES THE NUMBER OF DAILY BACKUP TAPES THAT ARE
     TO BE RETAINED.  DO "HELP NEWVOL O(BACKUPS)" TO OBTAIN
     MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT DISK BACKUPS.
))BSWKLY() - SPECIFIES THE NUMBER OF SEMI-WEEKLY BACKUP TAPES THAT ARE
     TO BE RETAINED.  DO "HELP NEWVOL O(BACKUPS)" TO OBTAIN
     MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT DISK BACKUPS.
))BWEEKLY() - SPECIFIES THE NUMBER OF WEEKLY BACKUP TAPES THAT ARE
     TO BE RETAINED.  DO "HELP NEWVOL O(BACKUPS)" TO OBTAIN
     MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT DISK BACKUPS.
))BMNTHLY() - SPECIFIES THE NUMBER OF MONTHLY BACKUP TAPES THAT ARE
     TO BE RETAINED.  DO "HELP NEWVOL O(BACKUPS)" TO OBTAIN
     MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT DISK BACKUPS.
))BQTRLY() - SPECIFIES THE NUMBER OF QUARTERLY BACKUP TAPES THAT ARE
     TO BE RETAINED.  DO "HELP NEWVOL O(BACKUPS)" TO OBTAIN
     MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT DISK BACKUPS.
))BYEARLY() - SPECIFIES THE NUMBER OF YEARLY BACKUP TAPES THAT ARE
     TO BE RETAINED.  DO "HELP NEWVOL O(BACKUPS)" TO OBTAIN
     MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT DISK BACKUPS.
))BACKUPS - NOTE THAT THERE IS NO OPERAND CALLED BACKUPS ON THE
     NEWVOL COMMAND.  THIS IS MERELY A KEY TO IDENTIFY GENERAL
     INFO ABOUT DISK BACKUPS.  THE OPERANDS BDAILY, BSWKLY, BWEEKLY,
     BMNTHLY, BQTRLY, AND BYEARLY ARE USED TO SPECIFY THE FREQUENCY
     WITH WHICH A GIVEN DISK VOLUME IS TO BE BACKED UP, AND TO SPECIFY
     THE NUMBER OF GENERATIONS OF BACKUP TAPES TO BE RETAINED.
     SPECIFYING BDAILY(5), FOR EXAMPLE, INDICATES THAT THE DISK
     VOLUME IS TO BE BACKED UP DAILY, AND THAT 5 GENERATIONS ARE TO
     BE RETAINED.

     BACKUPS ARE MAINTAINED AS GENERATION DATA GROUPS WITH NAMES
     OF THE FORMS U.SD.U000.BACKUP.&VOLSER.&CYCLE WHERE &VOLSER
     IS THE VOLUME SERIAL OF THE BACKED-UP VOLUME, AND &CYCLE IS
     EITHER DAILY, SWKLY, WEEKLY, MNTHLY, QTRLY, OR YEARLY.  WHEN YOU
     ENTER THE NEWVOL COMMAND SPECIFYING ONE OF THE BACKUP OPERANDS,
     THE COMMAND WILL REBUILD THE APPROPRIATE GENERATION DATA GROUP
     TO CONTAIN THE PROPER NUMBER OF GENERATIONS.  IF THERE WERE
     DATA SETS IN THE GENERATION DATA GROUP WHEN THE COMMAND WAS
     ENTERED, THEY WILL BE RE-CATALOGED IN THE NEW GROUP.

     SIX JOBS PERFORM THE ACTUAL BACKUP OF THE DISK VOLUMES BASED
     ON FREQUENCY.  SEE THE FOLLOWING TABLE:

                    JOB NAME     FREQUENCY
                    AU109694     DAILY
                    AU109695     SEMI-WEEKLY
                    AU109696     WEEKLY
                    AU109697     MNTHLY
                    AU109698     QTRLY
                    AU109699     YEARLY

     EACH JOB INTERROGATES THE REQSPACE DATA BASE, AND WILL GENERATE
     THE NECESSARY JCL TO BACK UP THE APPROPRIATE PACKS BASED ON THE
     INDICATED FREQUENCY.  IN ADDITION, JOB AU109694 WILL ALSO CHECK
     TO SEE IF AT LEAST ONE BACKUP TAPE EXISTS FOR THE FREQUENCIES
     WEEKLY, MNTHLY, QTRLY, AND YEARLY.  IF ONE DOES NOT, AND THE
     DATA BASE INDICATES THAT BACKUPS OF THAT FREQUENCY SHOULD BE
     MAINTAINED, JCL TO DO A BACKUP OF THAT FREQUENCY WILL BE
     GENERATED.

     NOTE THAT THE LISTVOL COMMAND WILL INDICATE THE NUMBER OF
     TAPES THAT ARE TO BE RETAINED FOR EACH FREQUENCY, AND WILL
     ALSO INDICATE THAT DATE THE MOST RECENT BACKUP WAS MADE FOR
     EACH FREQUENCY.
))SCRTCH(YES) - THIS KEYWORD IS USED TO SPECIFY THAT THE VOLUME
     IS NOT TO BE PROCESSED BY JOB AU109856.  THIS JOB SCANS DISK
     VOLUMES FOR UNAUTHORIZED DATA SETS, AND GENERATES EXCEPTIONS
     REPORTS ON THE STATUS OF THE SPACE ON THE VOLUME.  THE
     DEFAULT IS SCRTCH(YES).  SPECIFYING SCRTCH(NO) WILL CAUSE
     THE VOLUME TO BE OMITTED FROM PROCESSING BY AU109856.
))PHYSER() - THIS KEYWORD IS USED TO SPECIFY THE PHYSICAL VOLUME
     SERIAL NUMBER RECORDED ON THE DISK BY THE MANUFACURER.  A
     MAXIMUM OF 8 ALPHANUMERIC CHARACTERS MAY BE SPECIFIED.
