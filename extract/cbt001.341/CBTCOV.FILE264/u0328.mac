THIS PI COURSE WILL PROVIDE YOU WITH SUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE SO THAT
YOU CAN USE THE FACILITIES OF THE 3270 CRT TERMINAL, AND WILL BE ABLE
TO INITIATE AND TERMINATE A TSO SESSION.

BEFORE YOU START A TSO TERMINAL SESSION, YOU MUST FIRST ESTABLISH THE
STATUS OF YOUR TERMINAL, AND THAT TSO IS AVAILABLE.  IF THE POWER IS
OFF ON THE 3270, PULL OUT THE POWER CONTROL KNOB, LABELLED "OFF-PUSH"
ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE DISPLAY SCREEN.  TURN THE POWER CONTROL KNOB ALL
THE WAY CLOCKWISE INITIALLY.  AFTER A MINUTE, WHEN THE CURSOR (AN
UNDERSCORE CHARACTER WHICH IS DESCRIBED IN DETAIL LATER ON) APPEARS
ON THE SCREEN, YOU CAN TURN THE KNOB BACK PART WAY TO REDUCE EXCESSIVE
BRIGHTNESS.

IF THE POWER IS ALREADY ON, CHECK TO SEE IF THE INPUT INHIBITED LIGHT
IS ON.  THIS IS THE LOWEST OF THREE LIGHTS WHICH CAN APPEAR ALONG THE
RIGHT-HAND EDGE OF THE SCREEN.  IF THIS LIGHT IS ON, IT NORMALLY
INDICATES THAT TSO IS PROCESSING A PREVIOUSLY ENTERED COMMAND, AND
IS NOT READY TO ACCEPT ANOTHER COMMAND YET.  IF THIS IS THE CASE, IT
MAY BE THAT THE PREVIOUS USER OF THIS TERMINAL HAS LEFT FOR A SHORT
TIME, PERHAPS TO GET A DRINK.  YOU SHOULD CHOOSE ANOTHER TERMINAL IF
ONE IS AVAILABLE.

IF THE INPUT INHIBITED LIGHT IS ON, IT MAY ALSO INDICATE THAT TSO
IS NOT AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME.  YOU CAN FIND THIS OUT BY DIALING
5476.  THIS IS A RECORDED MESSAGE SET UP BY THE COMPUTER OPERATOR,
AND IT INDICATES THE STATUS OF THE COMPUTER AND MANY OF THE SYSTEMS
SUCH AS TSO.  NOTE THAT IF YOU ARE OUTSIDE THE MAIN OFFICE BUILDING,
THE NUMBER IS 729-5476.

IF THE RECORDED TELEPHONE MESSAGE INDICATES TSO IS AVAILABLE, AND
YOU WANT TO LOGON WITH A TERMINAL THAT HAD THE INPUT INHIBITED LIGHT
ON WHEN YOU ARRIVED, TRY HITTING THE RESET AND CLEAR KEYS IN THAT
ORDER.  IF THE INPUT INHIBITED LIGHT COMES ON AND STAYS ON FOR AT
LEAST 5 MINUTES, REDIAL 5476 TO MAKE SURE THAT THE STATUS OF TSO HAS
NOT CHANGED.  IF THE RECORDED MESSAGE INDICATES TSO IS AVAILABLE,
CONTACT SYSTEM SUPPORT.
$ Q1
IF YOU ARE HAVING TROUBLE GAINING ACCESS TO TSO THROUGH YOUR TERMINAL
WHAT TELEPHONE NUMBER WOULD YOU CALL TO FIND OUT IF TSO IS AVAILABLE?
$ANS 5476 Q1A
NO, THE NUMBER IS 5476.  THIS IS A RECORDED MESSAGE THAT INDICATES THE
STATUS OF THE COMPUTER AND SYSTEMS SUCH AS TSO.  JUST TO MAKE SURE
YOU REMEMBER
$GOTO Q1
$ Q1A
RIGHT.
ONCE YOU HAVE A TERMINAL THAT SEEMS TO BE WORKING PROPERLY, THE
NEXT STEP IS TO HIT THE CLEAR KEY.  THIS WILL CAUSE THE SCREEN
TO BE ERASED, AND THE CURSOR WILL BE MOVED TO THE UPPER LEFT
HAND CORNER OF THE SCREEN.  IF THE INPUT INHIBITED LIGHT STAYS
ON, OR THE MESSAGE "TSO IS NOT ACTIVE" APPEARS, DIAL 5476 AS
INDICATED ABOVE.  IF NO MESSAGE APPEARS ON THE SCREEN, OR THE
MESSAGE "IKJ54012A ENTER LOGON -" APPEARS, HIT THE ERASE INPUT
KEY, THEN KEY THE WORD LOGON, AND HIT THE ENTER KEY.

IF THE MESSAGE "LOGON INVALID SUBCOMMAND" NOW APPEARS, THIS
INDICATES THAT THE PREVIOUS USER OF THIS TERMINAL IS STILL LOGGED
ON.  IF YOU WISH TO CONTINUE TO LOGON, HIT THE PA1 KEY IN THE
UPPER RIGHT-HAND CORNER OF THE KEYBOARD REPEATEDLY UNTIL THE WORD
READY APPEARS ON THE SCREEN.
$ LOGON

THEN KEY THE WORD LOGON AND HIT THE ENTER KEY.  THE NEXT MESSAGE
THAT WILL APEAR WILL BE "ENTER USERID -" TO WHICH YOU SHOULD RESPOND
BY KEYING YOUR USERID AND HITTING THE ENTER KEY.

THE NEXT MESSAGE WILL BE "ENTER PASSWORD -."  DON'T BE ALARMED WHEN
YOU BEGIN TO KEY YOUR PASSWORD, AND THE CHARACTERS DON'T APPEAR ON
THE SCREEN.  THERE IS A SPECIAL FEATURE ON THE 3270 TERMINAL WHICH
SUPPRESSES PRINTING AS YOU KEY.  THIS FEATURE IS USED TO PROTECT
YOUR PASSWORD.

AT THIS POINT, A SERIES OF MESSAGES WILL APPEAR ON YOUR SCREEN WHICH
WON'T BE DISCUSSED NOW.  IT IS SUFFICIENT FOR YOU TO KNOW THAT WHEN
YOU SEE THE WORD READY PRINTED ON A LINE BY ITSELF, AND THE INPUT
INHIBITED LIGHT GOES OFF, YOU HAVE SUCCESSFULLY INITIATED YOUR TSO
SESSION, AND THE FULL ARRAY OF TSO COMMANDS IS AT YOUR DISPOSAL.

$ Q2
WHAT ARE THE TWO ITEMS OF INFORMATION THAT THE LOGON COMMAND WILL
PROMPT YOU FOR?

A.  DATE AND TIME-OF-DAY.
B.  USER IDENTIFICATION AND PASSWORD.
C.  BOTH OF THE ABOVE.

ENTER THE LETTER MATCHING THE ANSWER YOU FEEL IS CORRECT.
$ANS A Q2A
$ANS B Q2B
$ANS C Q2A
ENTER "A", "B" OR "C"
$GOTO Q2
$ Q2A
WRONG.  PLEASE REVIEW THE TEXT DEALING WITH THE PROMPTS FOR INFORMATION
THAT RESULT FROM ENTERING THE LOGON COMMAND.
$GOTO LOGON
$ Q2B
RIGHT.  THIS SENDS YOU ON TO THE NEXT TOPIC.

$ TYPING

PREVIOUSLY, WE MENTIONED THE CURSOR.  THIS IS THE CONTROL SYMBOL WHICH
LOOKS LIKE AN UNDERSCORE.  ITS POSITION ON THE SCREEN INDICATES THE
LOCATION WHERE THE NEXT CHARACTER YOU KEY WILL BE PLACED.  YOU
CONTROL THE CURSOR BY USING THE FOUR KEYS WITH ARROWS ON THEM
LOCATED ON THE LOWER RIGHT CORNER OF THE KEYBOARD.  THE ARROWS
INDICATE THE DIRECTION THE CURSOR WILL MOVE IF YOU PRESS THE KEY.

IF YOU WISH TO CORRECT TYPING ERRORS, YOU MAY DO SO BEFORE HITTING
THE ENTER KEY BY MOVING THE CURSOR UNDER THE ERROR AND TYPING THE
CORRECT CHARACTER.  YOU CAN ALSO CAUSE A COMMAND TO BE ENTERED A
SECOND TIME BY MOVING THE CURSOR BACK UP THE SCREEN AND RE-KEYING
ANY ONE CHARACTER.  FOR EXAMPLE, SUPPOSE YOU ENTERED THE FOLLOWING
COMMAND:

    PLCI PILMAIN CS(60) OBJ(PIL PILMAIN) LIB(JCL.CNTL)

AS A RESULT, YOU WILL RECEIVE THE ERROR MESSAGE "COMMAND PLCI NOT
FOUND."  THIS IS BECAUSE "PLCI" SHOULD BE SPELLED "PLIC."
INSTEAD OF KEYING THE ENTIRE COMMAND OVER AGAIN, YOU CAN MOVE THE
CURSOR BACK UP THE SCREEN AND JUST REKEY "PLIC" OVER THE
CHARACTERS "PLCI."

A WORD OF CAUTION:  THERE ARE CERTAIN PLACES ON THE SCREEN CALLED
PROTECTED FIELDS.  IF YOU HAPPEN TO MOVE THE CURSOR INTO ONE OF
THESE AREAS, AND THEN ATTEMPT TO KEY IN DATA, THE INPUT INHIBITED
LIGHT WILL COME ON, AND THE KEYBOARD WILL LOCK.  TO GET OUT OF THIS
SITUATION, HIT THE RESET KEY.  THIS WILL TURN OFF THE INPUT INHIBITED
LIGHT, AND WILL UNLOCK THE KEYBOARD.  THEN MOVE THE CURSOR OUT OF THE
PROTECTED AREA BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO KEY.
$ Q3

FOR EXAMPLE, THE FIRST POSITION ON EACH LINE OF THE SCREEN IS USUALLY
PROTECTED.  SUPPOSE YOU HAD KEYED IN THE WORD "GULL" AT THE BEGINNING
OF THE LINE WHEN YOU MEANT TO SAY "PULL."  WHEN MOVING THE CURSOR
BACK TO CORRECT YOUR MISTAKE, YOU MOVE IT ONE POSITION TOO FAR, AND
THEN TRIED TO KEY.  THIS WOULD CAUSE THE INPUT INHIBITED LIGHT TO
COME ON, AND THE KEYBOARD TO LOCK UP.  WHAT IS THE FIRST KEY YOU
WOULD HIT TO CORRECT THIS PROBLEM?

A.  CLEAR KEY.
B.  ERASE INPUT KEY.
C.  RESET KEY.

$ANS A Q3A
$ANS B Q3B
$ANS C Q3C
ENTER "A", "B" OR "C"
$GOTO Q3
$ Q3A
NO, THE CLEAR KEY, WHICH WOULD BE LOCKED ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE
KEYBOARD IF THE INPUT INHIBITED LIGHT WERE ON, NORMALLY IS USED TO
CLEAR THE SCREEN OF ALL DISPLAY.  TRY READING THE TEXT AGAIN.
$GOTO TYPING
$ Q3B

NO, THE ERASE INPUT KEY IS ONLY USED IN THE INITIAL LOGON SEQUENCE.
TRY READING THE TEXT AGAIN.
$GOTO TYPING
$ Q3C
RIGHT.  FIRST HIT THE RESET KEY TO TURN THE INPUT INHIBITED LIGHT
OFF, THEN MOVE THE CURSOR OUT OF THE PROTECTED AREA.

THERE IS JUST ONE MORE THING YOU SHOULD KNOW ABOUT USING THE CURSOR.
SUPPOSE I WANT TO ENTER A LINE OF DATA, AND INSTEAD OF USING THE
SPACE BAR AT THE BOTTOM OF THE KEYBOARD TO SPACE BETWEEN WORDS,
I USE ONE OF THE CURSOR CONTROL KEYS AT THE LOWER RIGHT OF THE
KEYBOARD.  SUPPOSE I ENTERED THE FOLLOWING LINE IN THIS FASHION.

 DO ANTS SLEEP?

ALTHOUGH THE LINE LOOKS CORRECT, WITH A PROPER SPACE BETWEEN EACH
PAIR OF WORDS, WHAT ACTUALLY GOT TRANSMITTED TO THE COMPUTER WAS THE
FOLLOWING:

 DOANTSSLEEP?

THIS IS BECAUSE MOVING THE CURSOR USING THE CURSOR CONTROL KEY DOES
NOT CAUSE A BLANK TO BE GENERATED.  IF YOU WANT A BLANK, THEN YOU MUST
USE THE SPACE BAR.  THIS CONCLUDES THE DISCUSSION ON THE CURSOR.

$ DELKEY

THE DEL KEY, LOCATED AT THE RIGHT OF THE KEYBOARD, HAS A VERY SIMPLE
FUNCTION.  IT DELETES WHATEVER CHARACTER IS LOCATED OVER THE CURSOR.
FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU KEYED IN THE WORD "BEAST" AND MOVED THE CURSOR
BACK UNDER THE CHARACTER "A" AND HIT THE DEL KEY, THE WORD WOULD THEN
READ "BEST".

$ INSERTK

THE INSERT KEY IS USED TO INSERT ADDITIONAL CHARACTERS IN A LINE.
PRESSING THIS KEY TURNS ON THE INSERT-MODE LIGHT AT THE RIGHT OF THE
SCREEN.  WITH THIS LIGHT ON, AS YOU KEY IN CHARACTERS, THEY ARE
INSERTED AFTER SHIFTING OVER ALL OF THE CHARACTERS ON THAT LINE,
BEGINNING WITH THE ONE OVER THE CURSOR.

$ Q4

FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU KEYED IN THE PHRASE "GET YOUR OUT OF THAT CHAIR,"
AND MOVED THE CURSOR BACK UNDER THE "O" IN "OUT," HIT THE INSERT KEY,
AND THEN KEYED "FOOT ", HOW WOULD THE PHRASE THEN READ?

A.  GET YOUR FOOT THAT CHAIR
B.  GET YOUR FOOT OUT OF THAT CHAIR

$ANS A Q4A
$ANS B Q4B
$ Q4A
WRONG.  TRY AGAIN.
$GOTO INSERTK
$ Q4B
RIGHT.
$ INSERT2
TO GET OUT OF INSERT MODE, HIT THE RESET KEY.

UNDER THE TSO EDIT COMMAND, WHICH IS USED TO MAKE ALTERATIONS TO
RECORDS IN A DATA SET, IT IS COMMON PRACTICE TO CAUSE A RECORD TO
BE LISTED AT THE TERMINAL BY USING THE LIST SUBCOMMAND.  THEN, BY
MOVING THE CURSOR BACK UP TO THE LISTED LINE AND RE-KEYING PART OF
IT BEFORE HITTING THE ENTER KEY, THE USER CAN CAUSE THE RECORD TO BE
CHANGED ON THE DATA SET.

$ Q4.1
FOR EXAMPLE,  THE USER MIGHT ENTER THE COMMAND "LIST 20," WHICH
CAUSES LINE 20 OF THE DATA SET BEING EDITED TO PRINT AT THE TERMINAL.
SUPPOSE LINE 20 READ AS FOLLOWS:

     20 WHITE WAS THE COLOR OF HER HAIR

BY MOVING THE CURSOR BACK UP UNDER THE W IN WHITE ON LINE 20, AND
THEN KEYING IN THE WORD "BROWN," AND THEN HITTING THE ENTER KEY,
LINE 20 IS CHANGED IN THE DATA SET.  WHICH OF THE FOLLOWING CHOICES
DO YOU THINK IS CORRECT FOR THE WAY LINE 20 LOOKS AFTERWARDS.

A.  WHITE BROWN WAS THE COLOR OF HER HAIR
B.  BROWN WAS THE COLOR OF HER HAIR

$ANS A Q4.1A
$ANS B Q4.1B
ENTER "A" OR "B"
$GOTO Q4.1
$ Q4.1A
NO, THE CHARACTERS ARE SHIFTED ONLY IN INSERT MODE.  TRY READING
THE TEXT AGAIN.
$GOTO INSERT2
$ Q4.1B
RIGHT.  THE WORD WHITE WOULD HAVE BEEN OVERLAYED BY THE WORD BROWN.
$ Q4.2

SUPPOSE, AS IN THE PREVIOUS EXAMPLE, YOU WERE EDITING A DATA SET, AND
HAD LISTED OUT LINE 30 WITH THE INTENTION OF CHANGING IT.  LINE 30
LOOKS AS FOLLOWS:

     30 THE COLOR OF HER HAIR

YOU WANT TO MAKE THE LINE READ AS FOLLOWS:

     30 BROWN WAS THE COLOR OF HER HAIR

IS THE FOLLOWING CORRECT?

     YOU CAN FIX LINE 30 BY GETTING INTO INSERT MODE, MOVING THE CURSOR
     UP UNDER THE "T" IN "THE," AND KEYING "BROWN WAS " AND HITTING
     THE ENTER KEY.

ANSWER YES OR NO.

$ANS YES Q4.2YES
$ANS NO Q4.2NO
$ Q4.2YES
SORRY, BUT IT WOULDN'T WORK.  PREVIOUSLY, WE INDICATED THAT CERTAIN
PLACES, SUCH AS THE FIRST POSITION ON EACH LINE OF THE SCREEN, ARE
PROTECTED.  WELL, WHEN TSO LISTS A LINE ON YOUR SCREEN, IT PUTS A
PROTECTED FIELD IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE LAST NON-BLANK CHARACTER
ON THAT LINE.  IN INSERT MODE, CHARACTERS ARE SHIFTED TO THE RIGHT
AS YOU KEY IN DATA. IN THIS CASE, THAT WOULD CAUSE DATA TO BE SHIFTED
INTO THE PROTECTED AREA.  NOTE THAT YOU ALSO COULDN'T ADD ON TO THE
END OF THIS LINE BY MOVING THE CURSOR UP AND KEYING DATA.  THIS, TOO,
WOULD OVERLAY THE PROTECTED AREA.
$ Q4.2NO
RIGHT.
$ Q4.2NO.A
WHEN YOU TRY TO DO THIS, THE INPUT INHIBITED LIGHT WOULD GO ON, AND
THE KEYBOARD WOULD LOCK.  HOW WOULD YOU GET THE KEYBOARD TO
UNLOCK?

A.  HIT CLEAR.
B.  HIT RESET.
C.  HIT ENTER.

$ANS A Q4.3A
$ANS B Q4.3B
$ANS C Q4.3A
ENTER "A" "B" OR "C"
$GOTO Q4.2NO.A

$ Q4.3A
WRONG.  THIS INDICATES YOU NEED A GREAT DEAL OF REVIEW.  THE
COURSE WILL SKIP BACK TO THE SECTION REGARDING TYPOGRAPHICAL ERRORS.
$GOTO TYPING
$ Q4.3B
CORRECT.  NOW FOR THE NEXT TOPIC ON ATTENTION INTERRUPTS.
$ PA1

DURING YOUR TSO SESSION, OCCASIONS MAY ARISE WHEN YOU WISH TO
PREMATURELY ABORT A COMMAND OR SUBCOMMAND.  YOU DO THIS BY HITTING
THE PA1 KEY WHEN THE INPUT INHIBITED LIGHT IS OFF.  THIS SIGNALS
AN ATTENTION INTERRUPTION, WHICH IS A SIGNAL FROM YOUR TERMINAL
TO TSO THAT YOU WANT TO INTERRUPT THE COMMAND OR SUBCOMMAND
THAT IS EXECUTING.

THE MOST COMMON USES FOR THIS FACILITY ARE INTERRUPTING A LARGE
VOLUME OF OUTPUT BEING PRINTED AT YOUR TERMINAL, AND INTERRUPTING
A COMMAND THAT IS PROMPTING YOU FOR DATA YOU DON'T HAVE.
$ Q5

FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN TSO DISPLAYS OUTPUT ON THE NEXT TO THE LAST LINE
ON YOUR SCREEN, TSO WILL DISPLAY "***" ON THE LAST ROW.  "***" MEANS
THAT TSO IS ABOUT TO CLEAR THE DISPLAY SCREEN AND IS ALLOWING YOU TIME
TO REVIEW THE CONTENTS.  YOU CAN DO ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:

     A.  CLEAR THE DISPLAY SCREEN BY HITTING EITHER THE CLEAR KEY
         OR THE ENTER KEY.  DISPLAY OF OUTPUT WILL CONTINUE ON THE
         NEXT PAGE.
     B.  HIT THE PA1 KEY TO CAUSE AN ATTENTION INTERRUPT.

IF YOU DON'T WISH TO SEE ANY MORE OUTPUT, WHICH OF THE ABOVE WOULD
YOUR DO; A OR B?
$ANS A Q5A
$ANS B Q5B
$ Q5A
NO, HITTING THE CLEAR KEY WOULD CAUSE MORE OUTPUT TO APPEAR ON A FRESH
SCREEN.  TRY READING THE TEXT AGAIN.
$GOTO PA1
$ Q5B
RIGHT.
             ENDING A TERMINAL SESSION

$ LOGOFF
TO END A TERMINAL SESSION, ENTER EITHER LOGOFF OR LOGON.  LOGON ENDS
THE PRESENT SESSION AND AUTOMATICALLY STARTS A NEW SESSION.  IN EITHER
CASE, TSO DISPLAYS:

     'USERID' LOGGED OFF TSO AT 'TIME' ON 'DATE'

NOTE THAT IF YOU RECEIVE THE MESSAGE "LOGOFF INVALID SUBCOMMAND,"
HIT THE PA1 KEY REPEATEDLY UNTIL THE WORD READY IS PRINTED.  THEN
ENTER THE LOGOFF COMMAND AGAIN.

THIS CONCLUDES THIS PI COURSE.  BY NOW, YOU SHOULD BE FAMILIAR
WITH THE BASIC FACILITIES OF YOUR 3270 TERMINAL, AND SHOULD KNOW HOW
TO LOGON AND LOGOFF.

LATER, WHEN YOU BECOME MORE FAMILIAR WITH TSO, YOU WILL FIND THAT THERE
IS A COMMAND FOR PRINTING DATA SETS AT THE PRINTER.  YOUR MIGHT WANT
TO PRINT THE TEXT FOR THIS PI COURSE AS A REFERENCE.  THE DATA
SET IS NAMED EUP027.U0328.DATA.

THE NEXT PI COURSE IN THIS SERIES IS U0329.  TO START, ENTER THE
COMMAND "PIL U0329" WHEN YOU SEE THE WORD "READY" PRINT OUT
AT THE TERMINAL.
