THIS TUTORIAL WILL INSTRUCT YOU ON HOW TO TAKE A PROGRAMMED
INSTRUCTION COURSE USING PIL.  PI (PROGRAMMED INSTRUCTION) COURSES ARE
ONES WHICH ARE ORGANIZED INTO BLOCKS OF TEXT, EACH OF WHICH IS FOLLOWED
BY A QUESTION AND MULTIPLE-CHOICE ANSWERS.  IF YOU GIVE THE WRONG ANSWER
ADDITIONAL BLOCKS OF TEXT ARE PRESENTED WHICH EXPLAIN
THE TOPIC IN GREATER DETAIL.  IF YOU GIVE THE RIGHT ANSWER
IT IS BE ASSUMED THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT TOPIC, AND THE
COURSE WILL MOVE ON TO NEW MATERIAL.  IN THIS MANNER, EACH STUDENT
GETS AS MUCH DETAILED EXPLANATION AS HE REQUIRES TO UNDERSTAND WHAT
IS BEING TAUGHT.

FOLLOWING IS A QUESTION TO ILLUSTRATE HOW A PROGRAMMED INSTRUCTION
COURSE WORKS.  YOU ARE GIVEN A MULTIPLE CHOICE TO ANSWER THE QUESTION.
JUST TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS, THE FIRST TIME, GIVE AN ANSWER SUCH AS "C",
WHICH IS NOT ONE OF THE ACCEPTABLE CHOICES.  YOU WILL BE GIVEN A SECOND
OPPORTUNITY TO ANSWER THE QUESTION CORRECTLY.  WHEN THIS HAPPENS,
GIVE THE WRONG ANSWER.

$ Q1
QUESTION #1:  THE MOON IS MADE OUT OR GREEN CHEESE; ANSWER TRUE OR
FALSE.
$ANS TRUE TRUEANS
$ANS FALSE FALSANS
YOU DID NOT ANSWER THE QUESTION WITH ONE OF THE ACCEPTABLE
ANSWERS.  PLEASE TRY AGAIN AND ANSWER EITHER "TRUE" OR "FALSE."
$GOTO Q1
$ TRUEANS
YOU GAVE AN INCORRECT ANSWER TO QUESTION NUMBER 1.  AS ANY MOUSE
WILL TELL YOU WHO HAS BEEN THERE, THE MOON IS MADE OF LINDBERGHER.
AT THIS POINT IN A NORMAL PROGRAMMED INSTRUCTION COURSE, YOU WOULD BE
GIVEN ADDITIONAL BLOCKS OF TEXT EXPLAINING IN FURTHER DETAIL WHY THE
MOON IS MADE OF LINDBERGHER CHEESE.  NOW GO BACK AND TRY QUESTION 1
AGAIN.  THIS TIME GIVE THE ANSWER "FALSE."
$GOTO Q1
$ FALSANS
NOW THAT YOU'VE SEEN A SAMPLE OF HOW A PI COURSE WORKS, LETS
TAKE A LOOK AT A FEW SPECIFIC DETAILS ABOUT USING PIL.
THE FIRST ITEM IS THE ATTENTION FACILITY.  DO NOT USE THE
ATTENTION FEATURE ON YOUR TERMINAL TO INTERRUPT A PI SESSION.
INSTEAD, IF YOU WANT TO TERMINATE THE COURSE UNTIL A LATER TIME,
ENTER THE CHARACTERS "ATTN" WHEN YOU ARE ASKED FOR A RESPONSE
SUCH AS THE ANSWER TO A QUESTION.  THIS WILL CAUSE THE PIL COMMAND
TO STORE INFORMATION INDICATING WHERE YOU ARE IN THE PI COURSE,
AND TO EXIT SO THAT YOUR TERMINAL WILL ONCE AGAIN BE IN TSO READY
MODE.  LATER, WHEN YOU ENTER THE PIL COMMAND SPECIFYING THE SAME
COURSE NAME, YOU WILL BE RESTARTED WHERE YOU LEFT OFF.  TO
GIVE YOU AN IDEA HOW THIS WORKS, ENTER THE CHARACTERS "ATTN"
NOW, AND WHEN THE WORD "READY" PRINTS OUT, ENTER THE COMMAND
"PIL U0327" AGAIN.
$ ATTN
ENTER "CONT" TO CONTINUE, OR "ATTN" TO SUSPEND THE PI COURSE
UNTIL LATER.
$ANS CONT ANSCONT
$GOTO ATTN
$ ANSCONT
AS YOU CAN SEE, THE PI COURSE IS RESUMED WHERE YOU LEFT OFF.
THIS ABOUT SUMS UP THE USE OF PIL.  REMEMBER THAT "HELP PILINDEX
FUNCTION" GIVES YOU A LISTING OF ALL PI COURSES AVAILABLE
THROUGH PIL, AND THE "HELP PILINDEX OPERANDS(U0327)" FOR EXAMPLE,
WILL GIVE A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PI COURSE NAMED U0327.
CONCLUDES THIS PI.
THIS CONCLUDES THIS PI.
