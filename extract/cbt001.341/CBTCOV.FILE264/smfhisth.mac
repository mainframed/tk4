)F FUNCTION -
       THE SMFHIST COMMAND IS USED TO ADD SMF DATA TO THE
  HISTORY TAPES, AND TO UPDATE THE CONDENSED HISTORICAL
  PERFORMANCE DATA.
       THE SMF HISTORY TAPES HAVE DSNAMES IN THE FORMAT
  U.SD.U000.SMF.YEARYY.MON WHERE YY IS THE YEAR, AND MON IS ONE
  OF THE STRINGS JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT,
  NOV, OR DEC.  EACH HISTORY TAPE CONTAINS ONLY SMF RECORDS
  WITH WRITE DATES (OFFSET +6 IN EACH RECORD) CORRESPONDING TO THE
  YEAR AND MONTH IN THE DSNAME.  THE RECORDS ON EACH TAPE ARE IN
  SEQUENCE BY WRITE TIME (OFFSET +2).
       CONDENSED PERFORMANCE DATA MAY ALSO OPTIONALLY BE UPDATED
  WITH THE COMMAND.  THIS DATA MAY BE DISPLAYED WITH THE PLOT
  COMMAND (SEE HELP DATA).
       TO UPDATE THE SMF HISTORY TAPES, THE COMMAND WORKS
  BY GENERATING JCL FOR A JOB NAMES EUP027S1, WHICH WILL
  SORT THE INPUT SMF RECORDS INTO THE PROPER SEQUENCE,
  PRODUCING DATA SET U.SD.U000.SMF.SORTED.  AS EUP027S1 DOES THIS,
  IT KEEPS TRACK OF WHAT DATES ARE CONTAINED IN THE SMF DATA,
  AND GENERATES JCL FOR JOB EUP027S2 TO UPDATE THE APPROPRIATE
  HISTORY TAPES.
       NOTE THAT DUPLICATE RECORDS WILL BE CHECKED FOR, AND WILL NOT
  BE ALLOWED ON THE HISTORY TAPES.  THIS MEANS THAT YOU CAN FEED THE
  SAME TAPE TO THE SYSTEM TWICE WITHOUT MESSING UP THE HISTORY FILES.
       ***** NOTE ***** BECAUSE THE SYSTEM WON'T HANDLE CORRECTLY A
  SECOND UPDATE RUN BEFORE THE PRIOR ONE HAS COMPLETED, YOU SHOULD
  NOT ISSUE THE SMFHIST COMMAND ON YOUR OWN.  INSTEAD, HAVE TOM
  SMITH ISSUE THE COMMAND FOR YOU.  IN THIS WAY, HE CAN KEEP TRACK
  OF OUTSTANDING UPDATE RUNS, AND WON'T ISSUE A NEW SMFHIST COMMAND
  UNTIL PROCESSING FOR THE PREVIOUS ONE HAS COMPLETED.
       NOTE THAT THIS JOB WILL USE DATA SET &SYSUID.SMFHIST.CNTL
  TO CONTAIN THE GENERATED JCL FOR BOTH JOBS EUP027S1 AND EUP027S2.
)X SYNTAX -
  SMFHIST DA() MSGCLASS(A) CLASS(F) DISK -
          PLOT ONLYPLOT YY() MON() NEW PERFLIB()
          TEST SORTED PRINT OUTDA(TEST.DATA)
          UNIT(3350) SER(FSRTS1)
  REQUIRED - DA() IF ONLYPLOT IS NOT SPECIFIED
             YY() AND MON() IF ONLYPLOT IS SPECIFIED
  EXAMPLES -
          SMFHIST DA(NEW.SMF.DATA)
             CAUSES THE SMF RECORDS IN DATA SET NEW.SMF.DATA
             TO BE SORTED AND MERGED ONTO THE APPROPRIATE SMF
             HISTORY TAPES.
          SMFHIST ONLYPLOT YY(77) MON(JAN) NEW
             CAUSES THE PERFORMANCE DATA FOR JANUARY 1977 TO
             BE RECREATED BASED ON THE SMF RECORDS CURRENTLY
             IN SMF HISTORY DATA SET U.SD.U000.SMF.YEAR77.JAN.
          SMFHIST TEST
             CAUSES PERFORMANCE DATA TO BE GENERATED IN
             DATA SET USERID.TEST.DATA BASED ON INPUT SMF RECORDS
             IN DATA SET U.SD.U000.SMFDATA.  THE PERFORMANCE
             PROGRAMS USED TO GENERATE THE DATA MUST BE
             PREVIOUSLY STORED IN DATA SET USERID.TEST.LOAD.
             THE PERFORMANCE DATA GENERATED IN DATA SET
             USERID.TEST.DATA CAN SUBSEQUENTLY BE EXAMINED
             BY USING THE PLOT TSO COMMAND.
)O OPERANDS -
))DA('DSNAME') - THIS MUST BE A FULLY QUALIFIED NAME AND SHOULD
   NOT BE CONTAINED IN QUOTES.  IT INDICATES THE INPUT DATA SET
   CONTAINING SMF RECORDS.
   (SEE HELP FOR THE YY AND MON OPERANDS).  OTHERWISE, YOU
   WILL BE PROMPTED FOR A DSNAME.
        IF THE ONLYPLOT KEYWORD IS SPECIFIED, AND THE DA
   KEYWORD IS NOT, A DEFAULT DSNAME OF THE FORM
   U.SD.U000.YEAR&YY..&MON WILL BE USED, AND YOU WILL BE
   PROMPTED FOR THE YY AND MON OPERANDS.
        IF TEST IS SPECIFIED, AND THE DA KEYWORD IS NOT, IF
   THE YY AND MON OPERANDS WERE ALSO NOT SPECIFIED, THE
   DEFAULT IS DATA SET U.SD.U000.SMFDATA.  IF EITHER OF THE
   OPERANDS YY OR MON IS SPECIFIED, A DEFAULT DSNAME OF THE
   FORM U.SD.U000.YEAR&YY..&MON WILL BE USED, AND YOU WILL
   BE PROMPTED IF BOTH MON AND YY WERE NOT SPECIFIED.  NOTE
   ALSO THAT IF ONE OR BOTH OF THE OPERANDS MON AND YY ARE
   SPECIFIED, ANY VALUE SPECIFIED FOR THE DA OPERAND WILL BE
   IGNORED.
        IF NEITHER TEST NOR ONLYPLOT IS SPECIFIED, YOU WILL
   BE PROMPTED FOR A DSNAME IF THE DA OPERAND IS OMITTED.
))MSGCLASS(A) - THIS IS THE MSGCLASS THAT WILL BE USED ON THE
   JOBCARDS FOR EUP027S1 AND EUP027S2, WHICH ARE THE TWO JOBS
   GENERATED BY THIS COMMAND.  THE DEFAULT IS MSGCLASS(A).
))CLASS(F) - THIS IS THE JOB CLASS USED FOR JOBS EUP027S1 AND
   EUP027S2.  SINCE SMF RECORDS USUALLY COME IN LARGE QUANTITIES,
   AND WILL PROBABLY TAKE A LARGE CHUNK OR RESOURCES TO SORT AND
   MERGE, THE DEFAULT CLASS IS F, WHICH INDICATES OVERNIGHT
   PROCESSING.
))DISK - THIS KEYWORD SHOULD BE SPECIFIED IF THE INPUT DATA SET
   (DA() OPERAND) IS A DISK DATA SET.  OTHERWISE, THE COMMAND
   ASSUMES THAT THE DATA SET IS ON TAPE, AND WILL GENERATE A
   SETUP CARD ACCORDINGLY.
))PLOT - THIS KEYWORD SHOULD BE SPECIFIED IF THE CONDENSED
   PERFORMANCE DATA IS TO BE UPDATED IN ADDITION TO THE SMF
   HISTORY TAPES (SEE HELP DATA FOR THE PLOT COMMAND).
   NOTE THAT THIS KEYWORD IS MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE WITH THE
   ONLYPLOT AND TEST KEYWORDS.
))ONLYPLOT - THIS KEYWORD SHOULD BE SPECIFIED IF ONLY THE CONDENSED
   PERFORMANCE DATA (SEE HELP FOR THE PLOT COMMAND) IS TO BE
   UPDATED BASED ON THE INPUT SMF HISTORY TAPES AS THEY CURRENTLY
   EXIST.  IF THIS KEYWORD IS SPECIFIED, YOU MUST SPECIFY
   VALUES FOR THE YY AND MON KEYWORD PARAMETERS.  IF NOT, YOU WILL
   BE PROMPTED.  NOTE THAT THIS KEYWORD IS MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE
   WITH THE PLOT AND TEST KEYWORDS.
))TEST - THIS KEYWORD IS USED TO TEST OUT A NEW PERFORMANCE
   GENERATION MODULE (SEE DOCUMENTATION FOR THE @PLOT, @TYPE, AND
   @EOJ MACROS).  FOLLOWING IS THE SOURCE FOR A TYPICAL
   MODULE:
       /* PERF001 */
       % INCLUDE PERFA;
       @TYPE(5);
       @PLOT(1,'TOTAL JOBS RUN/HOUR',1);
       % INCLUDE PERFB;

   WHICH WOULD BE COMPILED AND LINKEDITED WITH THE FOLLOWING
   SEQUENCE OF TSO COMMANDS:

       PLI PERF001 M LIB('SYS2.MACLIB') OBJ CS(60)
       LINK (PERF001 *) LOAD(TEST(PERF001)) -
            LIB('SYS2.PLIBASE') PLIBASE PRINT(*)
         --ENTER LINKEDIT CONTROL STATEMENTS--
        ENTRY PERF
        (NULL LINE)

   OTHER OPERANDS THAT APPLY WHEN TEST IS USED ARE THE SORTED,
   PRINT, DA, OUTDA, UNIT, AND SER OPERANDS.
))MON() - THIS KEYWORD
   IN COMBINATION WITH THE VALUE SPECIFIED FOR THE YY KEYWORD
   WILL BE USED TO GENERATE THE DSNAME FOR THE SMF HISTORY
   DATA SET TO BE USED AS INPUT AND/OR OUTPUT.  THIS NAME WILL
   BE IN THE FORM U.SD.U000.SMF.YEAR&YY..&MON.  IF PERFORMANCE
   DATA IS BEING GENERATED VIA THE ONLYPLOT KEYWORD, MON
   AND YY ARE REQUIRED AND ARE ALSO USED TO GENERATE THE MEMBER
   NAME IN THE FORM &MON&YY FOR THE OUTPUT DATA.  THIS MEMBER
   WILL BE STORED IN PARTITIONED DATA SET U.SD.U000.PLOT.DATA.
   THIS KEYWORD AND THE YY KEYWORD SHOULD NOT BE USED UNLESS
   THE ONLYPLOT OR TEST KEYWORDS ARE ALSO USED.  IF TEST
   IS SPECIFIED, MON AND YY CAN OPTIONALLY BE USED TO SPECIFY
   THE NAME OF THE INPUT SMF HISTORY DATA SET NAME OF THE
   FORM U.SD.U000.SMF.YEAR&YY..&MON.  IN THIS CASE, ANY VALUE
   SPECIFIED IN THE DA OPERAND WILL BE IGNORED.
))YY() - USE THIS KEYWORD TO SPECIFY THE YEAR CONTAINING THE
   PERFORMANCE DATA TO BE GENERATED.  THIS KEYWORD IS USED IN
   COMBINATION WITH THE MON KEYWORD.  SEE HELP FOR MON OPERAND FOR
   FURTHER DETAILS.
))NEW - THIS KEYWORD APPLIES ONLY IF THE ONLYPLOT KEYWORD IS
   ALSO SPECIFIED.  IT IS USED IF THE MEMBER NAME &MON&YY DOESN'T
   ALREADY EXIST IN DATA SET U.SD.U000.PLOT.DATA, OR IF YOU DON'T
   WANT THE DATA FROM THE OLD MEMBER TO BE MERGED WITH THE NEW ONE.
))PERFLIB('DSNAME') - THIS KEYWORD SHOULD ONLY BE USED IF EITHER
   THE ONLYPLOT OR TEST KEYWORDS IS ALSO USED.  IT SPECIFIES THE
   LOAD LIBRARY CONTAINING NEW PLOT PROGRAMS, AND MUST BE A
   FULLY QUALIFIED NAME AND SHOULD NOT BE CONTAINED IN QUOTES.
   PLOT PROGRAMS ARE GENERATED USING THE @PLOT, @TYPE, AND @EOJ
   MACROS (SEE DOCUMENTATION ELSEWHERE).  IF THIS PARAMETER IS
   NOT SPECIFIED, IN THE CASE OF ONLYPLOT, THE DEFAULT IS
   U.SD.U000.PERF.LOAD, WHICH IS THE STANDARD PRODUCTION LIBRARY
   FOR EXISTING PLOT MODULES.  IN THE CASE OF TEST, THE DEFAULT
   IS USERID.TEST.LOAD, WHERE USERID IS YOUR TSO USERID.
))OUTDA('DSNAME') -  THIS KEYWORD APPLIES ONLY IF THE TEST
   KEYWORD IS ALSO SPECIFIED.  IT IS USED TO SPECIFY THE
   NAME OF THE OUTPUT DATA SET TO CONTAIN THE GENERATED
   PERFORMANCE DATA (THIS DATA CAN BE ACCESSED USING THE
   PLOT COMMAND).  THE DSNAME MUST BE A FULLY QUALIFIED NAME
   AND SHOULD NOT BE CONTAINED IN QUOTES.  IF OUTDA IS NOT
   USED, THE DEFAULT IS USERID.TEST.DATA, WHERE USERID IS YOUR
   TSO USERID.  JCL WILL SET UP SO THAT, IF THE SPECIFIED
   DATA SET DOESN'T ALREADY EXIST, IT WILL BE ALLOCATED
   AUTOMATICALLY.  IF THE DATA SET ALREADY EXISTS, IT WILL BE
   REUSED.
))SORTED - THIS KEYWORD APPLIES ONLY IF THE TEST KEYWORD IS ALSO
   SPECIFIED.  IT IS USED TO INDICATE WHETHER OR NOT THE INPUT
   SMF RECORDS HAVE BEEN SORTED OR NOT (NOTE THAT THE DEFAULT
   INPUT SMF DATA SET U.SD.U000.SMFDATA IS NOT SORTED).  IF
   SORTED IS SPECIFIED, THE INPUT SMF RECORDS ARE ASSUMED TO
   BE IN SEQUENCE BY CREATION TIME WITHIN DATE, AND SEPARATE
   PERFORMANCE RECORDS WILL BE GENERATED FOR EACH DAY
   ENCOUNTERED.  IF SORTED IS NOT SPECIFIED, CREATION TIMES AND
   DATES IN THE INPUT SMF RECORDS WILL BE IGNORED, AND ONLY
   ONE SET OF PERFORMANCE RECORDS WILL BE GENERATED CONTAINING
   ACCUMULATIONS FOR ALL SMF RECORDS INPUT.  YOU MIGHT ELECT
   TO OMIT THE SORTED KEYWORD IF YOU WERE TESTING A NEW PLOT
   MODULE, AND DIDN'T WANT TO GENERATE A LARGE VOLUME OF OUTPUT.
))PRINT - APPLIES ONLY IF THE TEST KEYWORD IS ALSO SPECIFIED.
   IF SPECIFIED, PRINTED HISTOGRAMS WILL BE GENERATED ON
   SYSOUT FOR ALL OF THE GENERATED PERFORMANCE DATA.
))UNIT(3350) - APPLIES ONLY IF THE TEST KEYWORD IS ALSO SPECIFIED.
   IT IS USED TO INDICATE THE UNIT PARAMETER TO BE USED IF THE
   OUTDA DATA SET DOES NOT EXIST AND MUST BE NEWLY ALLOCATED.
))SER(FSRTS1) - APPLIES ONLY IF THE TEST KEYWORD IS ALSO SPECIFIED.
   IT IS USED TO INDICATED THE VOLUME SERIAL ON WHICH THE
   OUTDA DATA SET IS TO BE ALLOCATED IF IT DOES NOT ALREADY
   EXIST.
