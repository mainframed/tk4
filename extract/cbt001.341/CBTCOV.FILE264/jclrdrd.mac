PURPOSE
.SP 1
JCLRDR IS A CATALOGED PROCEDURE WHICH, WHEN EXECUTED AS A STEP IN
YOUR JOB, WILL CAUSE THE OS READER/INTERPRETER TO PROCESS THE
JOB CONTROL STATEMENTS YOU SPECIFY, PLACING THE JOBS DESCRIBED
IN THE OS INPUT QUEUE.  THIS PROCEDURE CAN BE ESPECIALLY USEFUL IN A
SYSTEM IN WHICH YOU HAVE TWO OR MORE JOBS WHICH MUST ALWAYS
BE EXECUTED IN A CERTAIN SEQUENCE.  TYPICALLY, THE OPERATOR
IS ASSIGNED THE RESPONSIBILITY OF ENSURING THE PROPER
SEQUENCE OF EXECUTION.  THIS MANUAL INTERVENTION MAKES SUCH
SYSTEMS PRONE TO ERROR.  BY USING JCLRDR IN THE LAST STEP OF
EACH JOB TO READ IN THE NEXT JOB IN THE SEQUENCE, THE SYSTEMS
ANALYST CAN ENSURE THE PROPER EXECUTION OF HIS SYSTEM.

LIB=PDSNAME SPECIFIES THE PARTITIONED DATA SET CONTAINING
THE JCL YOU WISH TO BE READ INTO THE SYSTEM.  IF YOU DO
NOT SPECIFY A NAME, THE DEFAULT IS SYS2.JOBPROC.  NORMALLY,
THIS IS WHERE YOU SHOULD STORE YOUR JOB CONTROL.
.SP 1
JOB=MEMNAME SPECIFIES THE MEMBER IN THE PARTITIONED DATA
SET SPECIFIED BY THE LIB= KEYWORD.  NORMALLY, THIS MEMBER
SHOULD CONTAIN THE JCL DESCRIBING JUST ONE JOB, BUT IT
CAN DESCRIBE AS MANY JOBS AS YOU LIKE.
.SP 1
FJOB=JOBNAME IS AN OPTIONAL PARAMETER THAT SPECIFIES THE JOBNAME
OF A JOB IN THE INPUT STREAM TO BE PROCESSED.  IF THIS PARAMETER
IS SPECIFIED, THE READER/INTERPRETER WILL BYPASS ALL JOBS IN THE
INPUT STREAM UNTIL IT ENCOUNTERS A JOB WITH THE SPECIFIED JOBNAME.
