)F FUNCTION
 USE THE SCRDEF COMMAND TO DEFINE THE 3270 FULL SCREEN FORMAT FOR
 INPUT AND OUTPUT TO EITHER A USER-WRITTEN PLI PROGRAM OR TO THE
 DATAENT (DENT) COMMAND.  THE COMMAND WILL ACCEPT YOUR SCREEN FORMAT
 DEFINITION, AND WILL GENERATE PLI DECLARE STATEMENTS DEFINING A
 SERIES OF CONTROL BLOCKS CONTAINING YOUR SCREEN DEFINITION.  YOU
 MAY SUBSEQUENTLY INCLUDE THIS SOURCE IN YOUR PROGRAM.
)X SYNTAX
 SCRDEF INDA('DSN') OUTDA('DSN') LOAD('DSN') PANEL('NAME') DE
)O OPERANDS
))INDA('DSN') - DEFINES AN INPUT DATA SET.  THIS INPUT MUST BE
     SOURCE PREVIOUSLY GENERATED BY THE SCRDEF COMMAND.  YOU WOULD USE
     THIS OPERAND TO CHANGE A PREVIOUSLY DEFINED SCREEN FORMAT.
     NOTE THAT THIS OPERAND MAY NOT BE SPECIFIED IF THE PANEL KEYWORD
     IS SPECIFIED.
))OUTDA('DSN') - DEFINES AN OUTPUT DATA SET TO CONTAIN THE PLI SOURCE
     STATEMENTS GENERATED BY THE SCRDEF COMMAND.  THIS OPERAND MAY
     NOT BE SPECIFIED IF THE PANEL KEYWORD IS SPECIFIED.
))LOAD('DSN') - DEFINES AN OUTPUT LOAD LIBRARY.  THIS OPERAND MAY
     ONLY BE SPECIFIED IF THE DE KEYWORD IS ALSO SPECIFIED OR IMPLIED,
     AND SPECIFIES THE LOAD LIBRARY IN WHICH THE LOAD MODULE
     CONTAINING THE DATAENT (DENT) SCREEN FORMAT DEFINITION IS TO
     BE PLACED.
))PANEL('NAME') - USE OF THE PANEL KEYWORD IMPLIES THE DE KEYWORD,
     AND ELIMINATES THE USE OF THE INDA, OUTDA, AND LOAD KEYWORDS.
     'NAME' SPECIFIES THE MEMBER NAME OF THE PLI SOURCE IN DATA SET
     PANEL.PLI.  IF THE MEMBER ALREADY EXISTS, IT IS ASSUMED THAT
     A PREVIOUSLY DEFINED SCREEN DEFINITION IS TO BE CHANGED.  A
     LOAD MODULE WITH THE MEMBER NAME 'NAME' WILL BE CREATED IN
     DATA SET PANEL.LOAD.  THIS LIBRARY MAY THEN BE SUBSEQUENTLY
     REFERENCED BY THE DATAENT (DENT) COMMAND.
))DE - THIS KEYWORD, WHICH IS IMPLIED BY THE PANEL OPERAND, INDICATES
     THAT THE SCREEN DEFINITION IS ONE TO BE USED FOR DATA ENTRY
     UNDER THE DATAENT (DENT) COMMAND.  THE SOURCE CREATED IN THIS
     CASE WILL BE A COMPLETE PLI PROGRAM, AND THE SCRDEF COMMAND
     WILL INVOKE THE PLI COMPILER TO COMPILE IT, AND WILL SUBSEQUENTLY
     CREATED A LOAD MODULE WHICH CAN BE REFERENCE IN THE DATAENT (DENT)
     COMMAND.
