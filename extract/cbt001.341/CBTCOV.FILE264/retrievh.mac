)F FUNCTION
  USE THE RETRIEVE COMMAND TO RESTORE TO DISK A DATA SET WHICH
  HAS BEEN DUMPED TO AN ARCHIVES TAPE.  A UTILITY PROGRAM IS RUN
  REGULARLY WHICH SELECTS TSO DATA SETS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN
  EITHER READ OR WRITTEN FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME, AND DUMPS THEM
  TO TAPE.  THE RETRIEVE COMMAND WILL GENERATE JCL AND SUBMIT IT
  FOR BATCH EXECUTION TO DO THE RETRIEVAL FROM TAPE.  NOTE THAT
  YOU MAY CREAT A DATA SET CONTAINING A VALID JOB JCL STATEMENT, OR
  YOU MAY USE ONE OF THE DEFAULT JOBCARDS SUPPLIED.

  FOLLOWING THREE DATA SETS EXIST -

     EUP027.TESTPGM.VSBASIC
     EUP027.TESTPGM.LIST
