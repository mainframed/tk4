 * THIS CONTROL BLOCK REQUESTS THAT DAIR ALLOCATE A DATA SET.          *
 * THE EXACT ACTION TAKEN BY DIAR DEPENDS UPON THE PRESENCE
 * OF THE OPTIONAL FIELDS AND THE SETTING OF BITS IN THE CONTROL
 * BYTE.
 *     IF THE DATA SET IS NEW AND YOU SPECIFY DSNAME, (NEW,CATLG)
 * DAIR CATALOGS THE DATA SET UPON SUCCESSFUL ALLOCATION.  THIS IS
 * THE ONLY TIME A DATA SET WILL BE CATALOGED AT ALLOCATION TIME.
 * IF THE CATALOG ATTEMPT IS UNSUCCESSFUL, DAIR FREES THE DATA SET.
 *     IF THE PROPER INDICES ARE NOT PRESENT, A NEW CATALOG MACRO,
 * CATBX, ATTEMPTS TO BUILD INDICES FOR DAIR.  DAIR NO LONGER DOES IT.
 *     DAIR SEARCHES THE DATA SET EXTENSION IN A MANNER THAT DEPENDS UPO
 * THE INFORMATION YOU SUPPLY IN THE DAIR PARAMETER BLOCK.
 * DAIR MAY SEARCH ON DSNAME ALONE, DSNAME AND DDNAME IF BOTH
 * ARE SPECIFIED, DDNAME ALONE IF NO DSNAME IS SPECIFIED,
 * OF DAIR MAY SEARCH FOR ANY AVAILABLE ENTRY.  IF DAIR
 * SEARCHES FOR AN AVAILABLE ENTRY IN THE DSE, THE ORDER OF
 * SELECTION IS:
 *       1. A DYNAM ENTRY
 *       2. A DATA SET THAT IS CURRENTLY ALLOCATED BUT NOT IN USE
 *       3. AND NOT PERMANENTLY ALLOCATED.
 *     IF NEITHER OF THE ABOVE TYPES OF DSE ENTRIES CAN BE FOUND
 * ALLOCATION CANNOT TAKE PLACE. IF AN ENTRY CAN BE FOUND FROM NUMBER
 * 2 ABOVE DAIR FREES THE ENTRY AND USES IT FOR THE REQUESTED
 * ALLOCATION.  IF DAIR CAN FIND AN ENTRY FROM NUMBER 3 ABOVE,
 * IT DECONCATENATES, THEN FREES THE DATA SET.
 *     TO ALLOCATE A UTILITY DATA SET USE DAIR CODE X'08' AND USE
 * A DSNAME OF THE FORM &NAME.  IF THE &NAME IS FOUND ALLOCATED IN
 * THE DATA SET EXTENSION, THAT DATA SET IS USED.  IF THE &NAME IS
 * NOT FOUND, DAIR ATTEMPTS TO ALLOCATE A DATA SET.
 *     TO SUPPLY DCB INFORMATION, PROVIDE THE NAME OF AN ATTRIBUTE
