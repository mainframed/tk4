 * DESCRIBES THE IN-STORAGE LIST POINTED TO BY THE NEW ELEMENT YOU     *
 * ADDING TO THE INPUT STACK.  IF YOU ARE DESIGNATING THE TERMINAL AS  *
 * THE INPUT SOURCE, NO LSD IS NECESSARY AND THE SECOND WORD OF THE    *
 * STPB WILL BE ZERO.  THE LSD MUST BEGIN ON A DOUBLE WORD BOUNDARY,   *
 * AND MUST BE CREATED IN THE SHARED SUBPOOL DESIGNATED BY THE TERMINAL
 * MONITOR PROGRAM; THE IBM-SUPPLIED TMP SHARES SUBPOOL 78 WITH THE    *
 * COMMAND PROCESSORS.
