*              TO DETERMINE HOW MANY PIECES ARE ON THE BOARD, AND     *
*              ON WHICH SQUARES THE PIECES ARE LOCATED.  THE NUMBER   *
*              OF PIECES WILL BE FOUND IN PACKED DECIMAL FORM IN A    *
*              TWO-BYTE AREA CALLED 'CHBPCTR'.  THE SQUARES ON WHICH  *
*              PIECES ARE LOCATED WILL BE FOUND IN UNSIGNED DECIMAL   *

*              THE TABLE WILL CONTAIN A NUMBER REPRESENTING ONE OF    *
*              THE 64 SQUARES OF THE BOARD.  THE END OF THE TABLE IS  *
