)O OPERANDS
))DSNAME - THIS IS THE FULLY QUALIFIED DATA SET NAME FOR WHICH
    SPACE IS TO BE RESERVED.
))PGMR - THIS IS THE THREE DIGIT PROGRAMMER NUMBER AS DESCRIBED
    IN SECTION 1.B OF THE ISD STANDARDS MANUAL.  NOTE THAT THIS
    KEYWORD IS ALWAYS REQUIRED ON THE REQSPACE COMMAND.
))DIV - THIS IS THE DIVISION CODE AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION 7.B.2
    IN THE ISD STANDARDS MANUAL.  NOTE THAT THIS KEYWORD IS ALWAYS
    REQUIRED ON THE REQSPACE COMMAND.
))CHANGE - INDICATES THAT A PREVIOUS REQSPACE REQUEST IS TO BE
    ALTERED ACCORDING TO THE OTHER OPERANDS SPECIFIED ON THIS
    CURRENT REQSPACE COMMAND.  PROGRAMMER NUMBER, DIVISION NUMBER,
    TRACKS RESERVED, AND FREQUENCY ARE SOME OF THE DATA ITEMS YOU
    MIGHT WANT TO CHANGE.  NOTE THAT IF NONE OF THE ALTERNATIVE CHOICES
    CHANGE, DELETE, OR SCRATCH ARE SPECIFIED, ADD IS ASSUMED.
    NOTE THAT CHANGE CAN BE SPECIFIED AS EITHER CHANGE, CHANGE(+),
    OR CHANGE(-).  IF NEITHER PLUS(+) NOR MINUS(-) IS SPECIFIED, ANY
    VALUE SPECIFIED IN THE TRK KEYWORD BECOMES THE NEW SPACE VALUE
    FOR THE DATA SET.  IF PLUS(+) OR MINUS(-) IS SPECIFIED, THE
    TRK VALUE IS ADDED OR SUBTRACTED FROM THE CURRENT SPACE VALUE
    FOR THE DATA SET.
))DELETE - INDICATE THAT A PREVIOUS REQSPACE REQUEST IS TO BE DELETED.
    NOTE THAT IF MORE THAN ONE DATA SET EXISTS WITH THE SAME NAME, YOU
    WILL HAVE TO SPECIFY THE VOLUME KEYWORD TO UNIQUELY IDENTIFY THE
    DATA SET FOR WHICH THE REQSPACE REQUEST IS TO BE DELETED.  NOTE
    ALSO THAT THIS COMMAND DOES NOT DELETE THE PHYSICAL DATA SET FOR
    YOU.  IT MERELY UPDATES THE REQSPACE DATA BASE TO INDICATE THAT
    THE DATA SET IS NO LONGER AUTHORIZED.  NOTE THAT IF NONE OF THE
    ALTERNATIVE CHOICES CHANGE, DELETE, OR SCRATCH ARE SPECIFIED, ADD
    IS ASSUMED.
))SCRATCH - MEANS THE SAME AS DELETE.
))TRK - INDICATES THE NUMBER OF TRACKS THAT THE USER DESIRES.  NOTE THAT
    ON A NON-SPECIFIC REQUEST FOR A NEW DATA SET (ONE ON WHICH THE VOLUM
    KEYWORD IS NOT SPECIFIED),  THE REQSPACE COMMAND WILL DOUBLE THE
    NUMBER OF TRACKS ALLOCATED IF THE SPACE MUST BE RESERVED ON A 2314.
))VOLUME - THIS PARAMTER SHOULD BE SPECIFIED ON AN INITIAL REQUEST ONLY
    IF THE DATA SET MUST BE ALLOCATED TO A SPECIFIC VOLUME FOR SOME
    REASON.  NORMALLY, THIS KEYWORD SHOULD NOT BE SPECIFIED SO THAT THE
    REQSPACE COMMAND PROCESSOR CAN RESERVE SPACE ON THE APPROPRIATE
    VOLUME BASED ON THE FREQUENCY OF USE OF YOUR DATA SET.  HOWEVER, IF
    YOUR DATA SET NAME IS NOT UNIQUE, THEN YOU MUST SPECIFY THE VOLUME
    KEYWORD.
))NEWVOL - THIS KEYWORD WOULD BE SPECIFIED IF A DATA SET FOR WHICH SPACE
    WAS PREVIOUSLY RESERVED IS BEING MOVE TO A DIFFERENT VOLUME.
))RESIDENT -  THIS KEYWORD SHOULD BE SPECIFIED ONLY ON DATA SETS
    DIRECTLY RELATING TO THE OPERATING SYSTEM.
))DAILY - INDICATES THAT THE FREQUENCY OF USE OF THE DATA SET IS DAILY.
))WEEKLY - INDICATES THAT THE FREQUENCY OF USE OF THE DATA SET IS
    WEEKLY.
))MONTHLY - INDICATES THAT THE FREQUENCY OF USE OF THE DATA SET IS
    MONTHLY.
))REQUEST - INDICATES THAT THE FREQUENCY OF USE OF THE DATA SET IS
    VARIABLE, AND IS AT THE REQUEST OF THE USER.
))OFFLINE - INDICATES THAT THE DATA SET MAY BE ALLOCATED TO A DISK
    VOLUME WHICH IS NOT NORMALLY ONLINE.  NOTE THAT JOBS WHICH
    REFERENCE SUCH DATA SETS WILL REQUIRE A HASP SETUP CARD.
))COMMENTS - THIS KEYWORD PERMITS THE USER TO RECORD DESCRIPTIVE
    TEXT ABOUT THE SPACE BEING RESERVED.  THE REQSPACE COMMAND
    WILL CONTINUE TO ACCEPT LINES OF TEXT UNTIL THE CHARACTERS "AA"
    ARE ENTERED ON A LINE BY THEMSELVES.
))GDG - THIS KEYWORD PERMITS THE USER TO REQUEST SPACE FOR A GENERATION
    DATA GROUP ON DISK.  THE NUMBER SPECIFIED INDICATES THE NUMBER
    OF ENTRIES IN THE GDG.  THE REQSPACE COMMAND MULTIPLIES THIS
    NUMBER TIMES THE AMOUNT SPECIFIED IN THE TRK KEYWORD TO DETERMINE
    HOW MUCH SPACE TO RESERVE.
