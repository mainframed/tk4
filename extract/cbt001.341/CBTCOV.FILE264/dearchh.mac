)F FUNCTION
  USE THE DEARCH COMMAND TO DELETE THE CATALOG ENTRIES FOR ARCHIVED
  DATA SETS (DO "HELP ARCHIVE") WHICH YOU NEVER INTEND TO RETRIEVE
  FROM THE ARCHIVES TAPES.  THE ADVANTAGE TO USING THIS COMMAND IS
  THAT YOU WILL CUT DOWN THE SIZE OF THE OUTPUT FROM THE LISTC COMMAND,
  AND ALSO YOU WILL BE HELPING TO IMPROVE TSO PERFORMANCE,  SINCE THE
  FEWER ENTRIES THERE ARE IN THE SYSTEM CATALOG, THE LESS TIME IT WILL
  TAKE FOR TSO TO DO A CATALOG SEARCH.

  DATA SETS EXCEPT YOUR OWN.  ALL CATALOGED DATA SETS WITH THE SPECIFIED
  HIGH LEVEL INDEXES IN THEIR DSNAME, AND WHICH ARE TAPE DATA SETS WILL
  BE UNCATALOGED.
