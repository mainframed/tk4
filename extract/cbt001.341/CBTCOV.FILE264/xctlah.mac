)F FUNCTION -
 USE THE XCTLA COMMAND AS A SHORT FORM OF THE CALL COMMAND TO
 CAUSE THE LOADING AND EXECUTION OF MODULES FROM A SET OF ONE OR
 MORE SPECIFIED LIBRARIES.  THE ADVANTAGE OF THIS COMMAND OVER THE
 XCTL COMMAND IS THAT A PROGRAM STRUCTURE IN WHICH SUB-MODULES ARE
 DYNAMICALLY INVOKED FROM A MAIN PROGRAM CAN BE SUPPORTED WHEN THE
 MODULES ARE IN ONE OR MORE LOAD LIBRARIES NOT CONCATENATED TO
 SYS1.LINKLIB AT IPL TIME.
)X SYNTAX -
     XCTL 'MODULE' LIB('LOAD-LIBRARY-LIST') PARM('PARM')
 EX:  XCTLA DAG01V LIB(TEST 'EUP063.GPSSLINK.LOAD') PARM('C')
)O OPERANDS -
))MODULE
     - NAME OF THE MODULE TO BE EXECUTED (NOTE - ENCLOSING
       QUOTES NOT NEEDED; THEY ARE SHOWN TO DIFFERENTIATE
       FROM A KEYWORD PARAMETER.
))PARM('PARM')
     - PARAMETER TO BE PASSED TO THE CALLED PROGRAM.  THIS PARAMETER
       WILL BE PASSED IN THE SAME FORMAT AS IT WOULD HAVE IF IT WERE
       SPECIFIED IN THE PARM FIELD ON AN EXEC JCL STATEMENT.
))LIB('LOAD-LIBRARY-LIST')
       SPECIFIES ONE OR MORE LOAD LIBRARIES TO BE SEARCHED FOR
       THE SPECIFIED PROGRAM NAME, AND FOR ANY SUB-MODULES WHICH
       MAY BE DYNAMICALLY INVOKED.  NOTE THAT IF A LIBRARY NAME
       IN THE LIST IS NOT CONTAINED IN QUOTES, AND THE DESCRIPTIVE
       QUALIFIER IS NOT LOAD, THE QUALIFIER LOAD WILL BE SUFFIXED.
