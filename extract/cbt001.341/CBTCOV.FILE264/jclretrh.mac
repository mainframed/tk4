)F FUNCTION
 USE THE JCLRETR COMMAND TO RETRIEVE PRODUCTION JCL WHICH
 HAS BEEN WRITTEN TO TAPE.  ALL SYSOUT CLASS 9, WHICH IS THE DEFAULT
 MSGCLASS FOR PRODUCTION JOBS SCHEDULED LOCALLY, IS WRITTEN BY
 OPERATIONS TO A TAPE IN GENERATION DATA GROUP U.SD.U000.KCXLOG.
 GENERALLY, ONE TAPE IS ADDED TO THE GENERATION DATA GROUP DAILY.
 THUS, GENERATION 0 REFERS TO TODAYS TAPE, GENERATION -1 REFERS
 TO YESTERDAYS TAPE, ETC.  THE NEW TAPE IS ADDED TO THE GDG EACH
 DAY AT ABOUT EIGHT O'CLOCK.

 NOTE:  IF THE JOB FOR WHICH YOU WANT JCL RETRIEVED WAS RUN RECENTLY,
 YOU SHOULD FIRST ISSUE THE STATUS COMMAND TO FIND OUT IF THE JCL
 HAS BEEN DUMPED TO TAPE YET.  IF THE STATUS COMMAND SHOWS THE JOB
 IS ON THE OUTPUT QUEUE, CONTACT COMPUTER OPERATIONS AND ASK THEM
 TO USE KCXWTR TO DUMP THE JCL TO TAPE.

 NOTE THAT THE JCLRETR COMMAND NEEDS DATA SET JOBCARD.CNTL.
 TO GET MORE DETAILS ABOUT THIS DATA SET, ENTER
