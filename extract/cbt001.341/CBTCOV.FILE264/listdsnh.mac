)F FUNCTION
  USE THE LISTDSN COMMAND TO OBTAIN INFORMATION STORED IN THE
  REQSPACE DATA BASE.  NOTE THAT SYSPRINT IS ASSUMED TO BE ALLOCATED
  TO THE TERMINAL.  NOTE THAT THIS COMMAND MAY GENERATE LARGE OUTPUT,
  AND MAY TAKE CONSIDERABLE TIME TO EXECUTE.  YOU EXECUTE IT IN BATCH
  AS IN THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLE:

       // EXEC REQSPACE
       //REQ.SYSUT1 DD *
       LISTDSN DIV(3)

  LISTDSN DATASET() DIV() DEPT() PGMR() REF() PERCENT() INDX()
          VOLUME() ALLOC() DELETE LESS MORE ORDER()

 EX 1:  LISTDSN DA(U.SD.U000.TGSLOAD)
            LISTS INFORMATION ABOUT DATA SET U.SD.U000.TGSLOAD
    2:  LISTDSN DIV(3) DEPT(10)
            LISTS INFORMATION FOR ALL DATA SETS BELONGING TO
            DIVISION 3, DEPARTMENT 10.
    3:  LISTDSN INDX(U.)
            LISTS INFORMATION FOR ALL DATA SETS WITH NAME BEGINNING
            WITH "U.".
    4:  LISTDSN DELETE
            LISTS ALL DATA SETS WHICH ARE SCHEDULED FOR DELETION
    5:  LISTDSN PERCENT(1) LESS
            LISTS ALL DATA SETS WHICH ARE USING LESS THAN 1 PERCENT
            OF THEIR ALLOCATED SPACE.
    6:  LISTDSN VOLUME(VSD500)
            LISTS ALL DATA SETS AUTHORIZED ON VSD500.
    7:  LISTDSN ALLOC(500) MORE
            LISTS ALL DATA SETS LARGER THAN 500 TRACKS.
    8:  LISTDSN DIV(1) DEP(5) PGMR(27) INDX(K.IS) PERCENT(5) LESS
            LISTS ALL DATA SETS BELONGING TO DIVISION 1, DEPARTMENT
            5, PROGRAMMER 27, WITH NAMES BEGINNING WITH "K.IS", AND
            ARE USING LESS THAN 5 PERCENT OF THE ALLOCATED SPACE.
    9:  LISTDSN PERC(2) LESS ORDER(DIV,DEPT,PGMR)
            LISTS ALL DATA SETS USING LESS THAN 2 PERCENT OF THE
            ALLOCATED SPACE.  THE REPORT WILL BE IN SEQUENCE BY
            DIVISION, DEPARTMENT, AND PROGRAMMER, RATHER THAN DATA
            SET NAME SEQUENCE, WHICH IS THE DEFAULT.
)O OPERANDS
))DATASET() - IS THE FULLY QUALIFIED DATA SET NAME FOR WHICH
    INFORMATION IS TO BE LISTED.  NOTE THAT STANDARD TSO NAMEING
    CONVENTIONS ARE NOT OBSERVED; THAT IS, THE NAME MUST BE FULLY
    QUALIFIED, AND IS NEVER SPECIFIED IN QUOTES.  NOTE THAT IF THIS
    OPERAND IS SPECIFIED, THE ONLY OTHER OPERAND THAT WILL BE
    RECOGNIZED IS THE VOLUME OPERAND.
))VOLUME() - RESTRICTS THE LISTING TO THOSE DATA SETS ON THE
    SPECIFIED VOLUME.
))DIV() - RESTRICTS THE LISTING TO THOSE DATA SETS BELONGING TO
    THE SPECIFIED DIVISION.
))DEPT() - RESTRICTS THE LISTING TO THOSE DATA SETS BELONGING TO
    THE SPECIFIED DEPARTMENT.
))PGMR() - RESTRICTS THE LISTING TO THOSE DATA SETS BELONGING TO
    THE SPECIFIED PROGRAMMER.
))REF() - RESTRICTS THE LISTING TO THOSE DATA SETS WHICH HAVEN'T
    BEEN REFERENCED FOR EITHER MORE OR LESS THAN THE SPECIFIED NUMBER
    OF DAYS (SEE THE LESS AND MORE OPERANDS).  NOTE THAT THIS
    INFORMATION IS ACQUIRED FROM THE REQSPACE DATA BASE, WHICH IS ONLY
    UPDATED ONCE EVERY TWO WEEKS.
))PERCENT() - RESTRICTS THE LISTING TO THOSE DATA SETS WHICH ARE
    USING EITHER MORE OR LESS THAN (SEE THE LESS AND MORE OPERANDS)
    THE SPECIFIED PERCENTAGE OF THE ALLOCATED SPACE.  NOTE THAT THIS
    INFORMATION IS ACQUIRED FROM THE REQSPACE DATA BASE, WHICH IS ONLY
    UPDATED ONCE EVERY TWO WEEKS.
))INDX() - RESTRICTS THE LISTING TO THOSE DATA SETS WHOSE NAMES BEGIN
    WITH THE SPECIFIED VALUE.
))ALLOC() - RESTRICTS THE LISTING TO THOSE DATA SETS WHICH HAVE
    ALLOCATED EITHER MORE OR LESS THAN (SEE THE LESS AND MORE OPERANDS)
    THE SPECIFIED AMOUNT IN TRACKS.  NOTE THAT THIS INFORMATION IS
    ACQUIRED FROM THE REQSPACE DATA BASE, WHICH IS ONLY UPDATED ONCE
    EVERY TSO WEEKS.
))DELETE - RESTRICTS THE LISTING TO THOSE DATA SETS WHICH ARE
    SCHEDULED FOR DELETION.  IF THIS OPERAND IS SPECIFIED, ALL OTHER
    OPERANDS ARE IGNORED.
))LESS - THIS OPERAND IS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE REF, PERCENT,
    AND ALLOC OPERANDS.  IT SPECIFIES THAT ONLY DATA SETS WITH LESS
    THAN THE SPECIFIED VALUE ARE TO BE LISTED.  IF NEITHER LESS NOR
    MORE ARE SPECIFIED, MORE IS ASSUMED.
))MORE - THIS OPERAND IS USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE REF, PERCENT,
    AND ALLOC OPERANDS.  IT SPECIFIES THAT ONLY DATA SETS WITH MORE
    THAN THE SPECIFIED VALUE ARE TO BE LISTED.  IF NEITHER LESS NOR
    MORE ARE SPECIFIED, MORE IS ASSUMED.
))ORDER - THIS OPERAND MAY BE USED TO SPECIFY THE ORDER IN WHICH THE
    OUTPUT IS TO BE SORTED.  ALL OF THE OPERANDS DATASET, DIV, DEPT,
    PGMR, REF, PERCENT, VOLUME, AND ALLOC MAY BE SPECIFIED, IN ANY
    SEQUENCE DESIRED.  NOTE THAT IF YOU JUST WANT THE REPORT IN
    DATA SET NAME SEQUENCE, DO NOT SPECIFY THE ORDER KEYWORD.  THE
    REPORT IS IN SEQUENCE BY DATA SET NAME BY DEFAULT, AND A SORT DOES
    NOT NEED TO BE DONE.
