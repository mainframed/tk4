                           OACFSORT MACRO

   The OACFSORT macro generates a dsect of the parameter list for
   OACFSORT, a fixed record length in storage sort routine.
   The DSECT and PREFIX keywords are supported.

   OACFSORT is reentrant and issues no system calls.  Thus it
   requires that a workarea be provided for it's use.

   Note that the work area size must be long enough to include
        one record, the sort stack, and sort working storage.

   record length + 100 bytes will be enough for most cases.

   (OACFSORT currently uses partition exchange)

.*---------------------------------------------------------------------
.*
.*  FSORT - FIXED LENGTH RECORD SORT (IN STORAGE)
.*
.* ENTRY: R1 = @ P# LIST
.*
.* EXIT: R15 = RETURN CODE (CC SET)
.*              0 - RECORDS SORTED (INPLACE)
.*              4 - WORK AREA TOO SMALL
.*
.* THE WORK AREA LENGTH IS:
.*  W#L + LENGTH OF ONE RECORD + STACK SPACE
.*
.*    COMPARE ROUTINE CALLED WITH:  R15 - ENTRY POINT
.*                                  R14 - RETURN ADDRESS
.*                                  R13 - @ 72 BYTE SAVE AREA
.*                                  R1  - @ ELEMENT
.*                                  R2  - @ ELEMENT
.*                                  R3  - COMPARE ROUTINE PARM
.*
.* CONDITION CODE RETURNED FROM COMPARE ROUTINE DETERMINES ORDER,
.*   IF HIGH THEN ELEMENT (R1) WILL APPEAR AFTER (R2),
.*   IF LOW  THEN ELEMENT (R1) WILL APPEAR BEFORE (R2),
.*   ELSE ORDER OF RECORDS IS UNDEFINED.
.*
.*  THE COMPARE ROUTINE MUST RESTORE *ALL* THE REGISTERS R0-R15.
