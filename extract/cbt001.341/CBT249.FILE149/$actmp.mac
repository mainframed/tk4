                      OACTMP

     The OACTMP service provides a standard method of attaching
 TSO commands or command proceedures. The OACTMP service automatically
 takes care of the rather complicated bookkeeping neccessary to accompli
 acomplish this, and it supports the % and ACF2 command limiting
 features. Use of this service insures consistency, and the needless
 duplication of code in TSO. It should be used in all OAC written
 command proceedures which attach TSO commands as subcommands.

     To invoke the OACTMP service, code the following assembly
 language macro:
                              'pgm name' or
                          PGM= pgm-name-addr

 label OACTMP         or  CBUF= buffer-addr

                                'command string' or
                          CMD = (cmd-addr,cmd-length)

     optionally you may code the following operands:

                                 'parm-string' or
                          ,PARM=  parm-addr

                                  0     (the default) or
                           ,DCB=  addr

                                  YES   (the default) or
                        ,CMDLIB=  NO

                                  0     (the default) or
                       ,TASKLIB=  addr

                                  YES   (the default) or
                          ,EXEC=  NO

                                  YES   (the default) or
                         ,STACK=  NO

                                  YES or
                          ,SCMD=  NO    (the default)

                                  YES   (the default) or
                                  'herald string' or
                          ,STAX=  herald-addr

                                  MSG    (the default) or
                       ,CMDFAIL=  NOMSG

                                  I      (the default) or
                                  L      or
                                  (E,parm-list-addr) or
                            ,MF=  (b,parm-list-addr)

     NOTE: That the PGM= and PARM= operands support "calling"
           programs with standard os batch calling conventions
           instead of as a TSO command proceedure.

   PGM=                the name of a program or the address of a
                       cl8 program name to be "called" by the
                       OACTMP service.

   CBUF=               The address of a TSO command buffer in
                       standard TSO format. The command line is
                       assumed to start at the position indicated
                       by the offset field.

   CMD=                Either the commmand line to be executed
                       exactly as it would be typed if entered from
                       the terminal; or the address and length of
                       such a command string.

   PARM=               The parm to be passed in R1 to the program
                       specified by PGM=, called by the OACTMP
                       service.

   DCB=                Either the address of an open DCB to be
                       searched for the command given, or 0 to
                       indicate that no specific library is to be
                       searched except as specified by CMDLIB=

   CMDLIB=             YES - The linklist is searched for the command
                       NO  - The linklist is not searched.

   TASKLIB=            Either the address of an open DCB to be
                       used as a TASKLIB for the attached command;
                       or 0 to indicate no TASKLIB.

   EXEC=               YES - If the command is not found in the
                             specified libraries, it is assumed
                             to be a CLIST and is EXEC'd
                       NO  - The command is not a CLIST.

   STACK=              YES - Any command added to the TSO stack
                             by a command executing under OACTMP
                             will be executed by OACTMP before
                             returning to it's caller.
                       NO  - Exactly one command is to be executed
                             by the OACTMP service.

   SCMD=               YES - Conditions the ECT so that the HELP
                             command will return information about
                             the calling command.
                       NO  - Conditions the ECT so that the HELP
                             command will return information about
                             the command being executed by OACTMP.

   STAX=               YES - An attention exit will be established
                             by the OACTMP service. or
                       Either a string, or the address of a halfword
                             length, followed by a string to be used
                             as a prompt by the OACTMP when an attention
                             is recieved. A pointer a halfword length
                             followed by the reply is returned in the
                             parameter list.

   CMDFAIL=            MSG   - If appropriate, the following messages
