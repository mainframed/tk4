          UNIQUE - select records with unique keys

//UNIQUE   EXEC PGM=UNIQUE,PARM='<offset>,<field len>,<order>,...'

//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*                  * record counts *

//IN       DD ---                       * input file    *
//OUT      DD ---                       * output file   *

   the parameter field specifies the position(s) of the key.
(more than one field may be specified).  Each field
is specified as:
     the offset of the field (origin 1, range 1 -> 4095)
     the length of the field (origin 0, range 1 -> 256)
     the sort order of the field (a or d)

  the input file must be in order by the specified fields
or the results are unpredictable.

  The output file will contain the first record found in the
input file for each unique input key.
The output file can be any recfm/lrecl, RDW's will be build/destroyed
and the resulting records will be truncated or padded if required.
