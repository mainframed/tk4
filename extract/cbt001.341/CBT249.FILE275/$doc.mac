*      THIS PROGRAM, CALLED 'CATUPDTE' IN EARLIER VERSIONS, IS     DCL
*      INTENDED FOR USE IN MVS SYSTEMS CONTAINING A VSAM MASTER    DCL
*      CATALOG AND ONE OR MORE NONVSAM 'USER' CATALOGS.  IT EDITS  DCL
*      NONVSAM DATASET ENTRIES IN BOTH MASTER CATALOG AND USER     DCL
*      CATALOGS, DELETING ENTRIES FOR DATASETS INDICATED AS RE-    DCL
*      SIDING ON DIRECT-ACCESS STORAGE VOLUMES BUT FOUND TO NOT    DCL
*      EXIST ON THE VOLUMES SPECIFIED, DELETING EMPTY INDEX LEV-   DCL
*      ELS IN NONVSAM 'USER' CATALOGS, AND CORRECTING TTR VALUES   DCL
*      IN CATALOG ENTRIES FOR WHICH THESE VALUES FAIL TO DESCRIBE  DCL
*      CORRECTLY THE LOCATIONS OF DATASET CONTROL BLOCKS (DSCB'S)  DCL
*      FOR THE DATASETS CONCERNED.  IT ALSO DELETES ENTRIES FROM   DCL
*      USER CATALOGS FOR WHICH NO ALIAS RECORDS POINTING TO THE    DCL
*      CATALOGS IN WHICH THEY OCCUR ARE FOUND IN THE MASTER CATA-  DCL
*      LOG.  RECORDS NOT SUBJECT TO ANY OF THE ABOVE CRITERIA ARE  DCL
*      PASSED WITHOUT MODIFICATION.                                DCL
*                                                                  DCL
*      THE PROGRAM PROCESSES NONVSAM DATASET RECORDS IN THE MAS-   DCL
*      TER CATALOG IN THE SEQUENCE IN WHICH IT ENCOUNTERS THEM     DCL
*      DURING A SEQUENTIAL SCAN OF THAT CATALOG.  WHENEVER IT EN-  DCL
*      COUNTERS A NONVSAM RECORD IDENTIFYING A NONVSAM 'USER'      DCL
*      CATALOG, IT PROCESSES THAT CATALOG FIRST AS A DATASET AND   DCL
*      THEN AS A CATALOG BEFORE PROCESSING THE NEXT MASTER CATA-   DCL
*      LOG NONVSAM RECORD.  EXECUTION ENDS AFTER THE LAST NONVSAM  DCL
*      RECORD IN THE MASTER CATALOG HAS BEEN PROCESSED.  WITHIN    DCL
*      EACH NONVSAM CATALOG, THE PROGRAM PROCESSES ENTRIES FOR     DCL
*      DATASETS AND EMPTY INDEXES IN AN ASCENDING EBCDIC SEQUENCE  DCL
*      OF THEIR NAMES.                                             DCL

*      TO FORM AN EXECUTABLE LOAD MODULE FROM THE SOURCE MODULES,  DCL
*      EACH MODULE MUST BE ASSEMBLED, AND THE RESULTING OBJECT     DCL
*      MODULES MUST BE LINKED INTO A SUITABLE LIBRARY.  CSECT      DCL
*      CTLGDRVR MAY BE ASSEMBLED WITH THE &SYSPARM ASSEMBLY PARA-  DCL
*      METER AS EXPLAINED LATER IN THIS INTRODUCTION.  IN LINKING  DCL
*      THE OBJECT MODULES INTO A SINGLE LOAD MODULE, THE ENTRY     DCL
*      POINT FOR CSECT CTLGDRVR MUST BE DESIGNATED AS THE MAIN     DCL
*      ENTRY POINT FOR THE LOAD MODULE.                            DCL
*                                                                  DCL
*      THE PROGRAM MAY BE EXECUTED IN BATCH VIA THE FOLLOWING JOB  DCL
*      CONTROL STATEMENTS (JCL):                                   DCL
*                                                                  DCL

*      IT MAY ALSO BE EXECUTED IN TSO, EITHER DIRECTLY OR UNDER    DCL
*      TEST.  FOR EXECUTION IN BATCH, IT MUST EITHER BE LOADED     DCL
*      FROM AN APF-AUTHORIZED LIBRARY OR HAVE BEEN ASSEMBLED WITH  DCL
*      THE PARM OPTION &SYSPARM='SVC=XXX', IN WHICH 'XXX' IS THE   DCL
*      NUMBER OF AN EXISTING TYPE-3 SVC WHICH RETURNS TO PROBLEM   DCL
*      STATE WITH PROTECT KEY 0 AND REQUIRES ENTRY WITH REG 15     DCL
*      POINTING TO A FULL-WORD ALIGNED 16-BYTE FIELD WITH THE 8TH  DCL
*      BYTE SET TO C'S' AND THE 9TH THROUGH 16TH BYTES AVAILABLE   DCL
*      TO THE SVC FOR USE AS A WORK AREA.  FOR EXECUTION UNDER     DCL
*      TSO, THE PROGRAM MUST HAVE BEEN ASSEMBLED WITH THE &SYS-    DCL
*      PARM SPECIFICATION UNLESS THE SYSTEM PERMITS TSO TO RUN     DCL
*      WITH APF AUTHORIZATION.  WHEN THE &SYSPARM OPTION IS USED,  DCL
*      THE PROGRAM MAY BE LOADED FROM ANY LIBRARY.                 DCL
*                                                                  DCL
*      THE PRESENT VERSION OF THE PROGRAM WAS DEVELOPED FROM A     DCL
*      VERSION DISTRIBUTED BY UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS AT CHICAGO    DCL
*      CIRCLE (UICC) ON 07/16/76.  CHANGES INCLUDE: (1) PROVISION  DCL
*      FOR DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATING AND READING SYS1.NUCLEUS(SYS-    DCL
*      CATLG) TO OBTAIN THE NAME AND LOCATION OF THE VSAM MASTER   DCL
*      CATALOG; (2) PROVISION FOR DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATING AND       DCL
*      READING THE VSAM MASTER CATALOG TO ACCESS ENTRIES FOR NON-  DCL
*      VSAM DATASETS CONTAINED IN THAT CATALOG, INCLUDING THOSE    DCL
*      FOR NONVSAM 'USER' CATALOGS, AND TO VERIFY CONNECTION OF    DCL
*      HIGH-LEVEL INDEXES IN USER CATALOGS TO ALIAS NAMES IN THE   DCL
*      MASTER CATALOG; (3) PROVISION FOR DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATING    DCL
*      THE USER CATALOGS; (4) CORRECTION OF A CODING ERROR WHICH   DCL
*      CAUSED DELETION OF EMPTY INDEXES TO FAIL; (5) AND EDITING   DCL
*      OF DOCUMENTATION IN GENERAL TO IMPROVE READABILITY OF       DCL
*      SOURCE LISTINGS.  INCORPORATION OF DYNAMIC ALLOCATION       DCL
*      ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR THE DD STATEMENTS FOR USER CATA-    DCL
*      LOGS REQUIRED BY THE 07/16/76 VERSION OF THE PROGRAM.  THE  DCL
*      REMAINDER OF THIS OPENING DOCUMENTATION IS COPIED WITH      DCL
*      ONLY MINOR EDITING FROM THAT ACCOMPANYING THE 07/16/76      DCL

*      DOCUMENTATION OF MVS VERSION OF CATUPDTE 7/16/76
*               BARRY SCHRAGER (UIC)
*
*
*      THIS VERSION OF CATUPDTE HAS ELIMINATED ITS DEPENDENCE ON
*      AN ASSEMBLED DEVICE TABLE; IT NOW USES SYSTEM SOURCES.
*
*      THIS VERSION OF CATUPDTE ALSO ACCEPTS SOME CONTROL CARDS VIA
*      SYSIN TO ALLOW FOR RECATALOGING DATASETS FROM ONE VOLUME TO
*      ANOTHER OR UNCATALOGING BY DEVICE TYPE, ETC.  THE LISTING FOR
*      THE PROCESS SUBROUTINE PROVIDES FURTHER INFORMATION.
*
*      CATUPDTE WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN BY BARRY SCHRAGER AND TOM KOLE
*      AT U OF I, WAS MODIFIED AND ENHANCED BY BOEING COMPUTER SER-
*      VICES, AND WAS FINALLY ENHANCED AT UICC BY EB KLEMENS.  THE LAST
*      VERSION HAD TO BE MODIFIED SINCE MVS NO LONGER SUPPORTED LOCATE
*      BY TTR.  THE PRESENT VERSION USES BDAM TO READ THE CATALOGS.
