0             TO HELP IDENTIFY THE DATE OF A LOG DATA SET, LOGSCAN
              RECOGNIZES THE DATE FROM MESSAGE IEE102I AS IT APPEARS
              IN THE LOG FROM A JES3/MVS SYSTEM.  A RECORD IS PRINTED
              THE FIRST TIME THIS MESSAGE IS FOUND AND EACH TIME THE
              DATE CHANGES.  TO UTILIZE THIS FEATURE ON OTHER TYPES OF
              SYSTEMS, ADD A MESSAGE THAT WILL BE ISSUED PERIODICALLY
              IN THIS FORMAT -
                                        IEE102I HH.MM.SS YY.DDD

0             THIS JCL IS SUFFICIENT TO SCAN THE CURRENT SYSTEM LOG
              WHEN ONE DATA SET IS EMPTY.  (THIS WILL NOT WORK FOR AN
              MVS SYSTEM LOG.  SPECIFY A DATA SET CREATED BY AN
              EXTERNAL WRITER.)  EXAMPLES OF OTHER USES APPEAR
              ON PAGE--9.
0----------------------------- INPUT DATA SETS ------------------------
0             LOGSCAN WILL PROCESS FIXED, FIXED BLOCKED, VARIABLE
              AND VARIABLE BLOCKED DATA WITH LRECL NOT LARGER THAN
              133, OR UNDEFINED RECORDS WITH BLKSIZE NOT LARGER
              THAN 133.  AS A CONVENIENCE, LOGSCAN WILL ACCEPT
              RECORDS UP TO 255 BYTES LONG, BUT ONLY THE FIRST
              133 BYTES CAN BE SCANNED, PRINTED OR PUNCHED.
              LOGSCAN STRIPS THE FIRST BYTE FROM INPUT RECORDS
              IF PRINT CONTROL CHARACTERS ARE INDICATED
              IN THE JCL OR THE DATA SET LABEL.  THE RECORD
              DESCRIPTOR WORD IS REMOVED FROM VARIABLE RECORDS.
0             THE CONTROL DATA SET IS FIXED OR FIXED BLOCKED WITH
              LRECL OF 80.  UNLIKE DATA SETS CAN BE CONCATENATED.
0----------------------------- OUTPUT DATA SETS -----------------------
0             PRINT OUTPUT IS RECFM=FB,LRECL=133.  A BLKSIZE OF 1995
              IS ASSUMED UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN THE JCL AS A
              MULTIPLE OF 133.  THE OUTPUT IS ALWAYS SINGLE-SPACED.
              THE PRINT DATA SET CONTAINS A LISTING OF THE CONTROL
              STATEMENTS USED, THE RECORDS SELECTED, AND STATISTICS
              ABOUT THE NUMBER OF RECORDS PROCESSED. THE STATISTICS
              KEPT ARE TOTAL RECORDS READ FROM THE LOG DATA SET,
              THE NUMBER WITHIN THE SPECIFIED TIME AND SEQUENCE
              NUMBERS, AND THE NUMBER FINALLY SELECTED.  AN IDENTIFIER
              IS PRINTED EACH TIME A NEW DATE IS OBTAINED FROM MESSAGE
              IEE102I (MVS ACTIVITY MESSAGE) OR IAT3100 (JES3 RESTART).
              THE STATISTICS DO NOT INCLUDE THESE RECORDS.
0             PUNCH OUTPUT IS PROVIDED IF //PUNCH DD IS INCLUDED IN THE
              JCL FOR A STEP.  RECFM IS FB, AND LRECL IS ASSUMED TO BE
              80 UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THE JCL.  BLKSIZE IS ASSUMED TO
              BE THE SAME AS LRECL UNLESS IT IS SPECIFIED IN THE JCL.
              RECORDS LONGER THAN THE LRECL ARE TRUNCATED.  ONLY
              SELECTED RECORDS ARE INCLUDED IN THIS DATA SET.
1------------------------- PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS --------- PAGE--3
0             LOGSCAN MAY BE EXECUTED ON OS/360 OR OS/VS SYSTEMS.
              THE AMOUNT OF CPU TIME USED VARIES GREATLY,DEPENDING ON
              THE SIZE OF THE DATA SET BEING PROCESSED, THE NUMBER OF
              DATA TYPE CONTROL STATEMENTS, THE RANGE OF TIME
              SPECIFIED, AND USE OF THE MARGIN CONTROL CARD.  IF THE
              POSITION OF A DESIRED MESSAGE IS KNOWN, A MARGIN CARD
              CAN BE USED TO COMPARE THAT ONE POSITION INSTEAD OF
              COMPARING 133 POSITIONS.  THIS ALSO CAN PREVENT UNWANTED
              RECORDS FROM BEING PRINTED.  IF SEVERAL DATA TYPE CARDS
              ARE BEING USED WITH A LARGE DATA SET, JUDICIOUS USE OF
              THE TIME CARD CAN REDUCE THE RUN TIME CONSIDERABLY.
0----------------------------- CONDITION CODES -----------------------
0             THE FOLLOWING CONDITION CODES ARE RETURNED BY LOGSCAN
0        0 - NORMAL RUN
         1 - NO OUTPUT BECAUSE NO RECORDS MATCHED THE ARGUMENT
         2 - EMPTY DATA SET
         4 - DATA SET LRECL LARGER THAN 255
         8 - CONTROL CARD HAD SYNTAX ERROR
        12 - REQUIRED DD CARD MISSING
1------------------------------ CONTROL CARDS ----------------- PAGE--4
0             ALL CONTROL CARDS ARE OPTIONAL EXCEPT THAT AT LEAST
              A TIME CARD OR SEQUENCE CARD OR ONE OR MORE DATA TYPE
              CARDS IS REQUIRED.  STATEMENTS MAY BEGIN IN ANY COLUMN.
0        TIME=HHMM,HHMM
0             SPECIFIES THE BEGINNING AND END OF THE DESIRED PERIOD.
              MAY BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH DATA TYPE CARDS.
              THE LAST TIME CARD READ IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE ENTIRE STEP.
              HHMM MUST BE FOUR DIGITS, WITH LEADING ZEROS IF NEEDED.
              IF THE BEGINNING TIME IS GREATER THAN THE ENDING TIME,
              IT IS ASSUMED THAT A TIME PERIOD SPANNING MIDNIGHT
              IS DESIRED.  THE PROGRAM PROCESSES RECORDS UP TO THE
              END OF THE DATA SET, SO RECORDS FROM MORE THAN ONE
              DAY MAY BE PRODUCED.  LOGSCAN RECOGNIZES TIME STAMPS
              OF 6 TO 8 DIGITS STARTING IN POSITION 1 OR 2 OF
              EACH RECORD OR IN THE FORMAT HH.MM.SS STARTING IN
              POSITION 6.  RECORDS WITHOUT TIME STAMPS ARE HANDLED
              ACCORDING TO THE MOST RECENT TIME-STAMPED RECORD.
0        MARGIN=SSS,EEE
0             SETS LIMITS OF THE SCAN, IF DESIRED.  DEFAULT IS 1,133.
              THIS SETS THE RANGE OF POSITIONS THE FIRST CHARACTER
              OF DATA MUST BE FOUND IN.  AS MANY MARGIN CARDS AS
              DESIRED CAN BE USED.  EACH ONE IS EFFECTIVE FOR ALL
              DATA TYPE CARDS FOLLOWING IT UNTIL RESET BY ANOTHER
              MARGIN CARD.  SSS AND EEE CAN BE ONE TO THREE DIGITS
              WITH VALUES BETWEEN 1 AND 133.  IF EEE IS OMITTED, IT IS
              ASSUMED TO BE THE SAME AS SSS, I.E. ONLY ONE POSITION.
              A FORMS RULER MAY BE USED WITH A SAMPLE OF A DATA SET
              FOR EXACT MARGIN DETERMINATION, SINCE CONTROL CHARACTERS
              AND RECORD DESCRIPTOR WORDS ARE REMOVED BEFORE
              PROCESSING, AND ONLY DATA IS SCANNED.

              THE WORD PARAMETER, IF USED, REQUIRES THE MATCHING DATA

              OR DEVICE NUMBER WHICH COULD ALSO APPEAR AS PART OF AN
              UNRELATED NAME, TO REDUCE UNWANTED OUTPUT.  CHARACTERS
              OTHER THAN LETTERS, NUMBERS, AND NATIONAL CHARACTERS ARE
              CONSIDERED TO BE PUNCTUATION.  THE ABBR PARAMETER
              REQUIRES THE MATCHING DATA TO BE PRECEDED BY A BLANK
              OR PUNCTUATION.  THIS WOULD BE DESIRED, FOR EXAMPLE,
              WHEN SEARCHING FOR A CERTAIN MESSAGE PREFIX.  IF NEITHER
              PARAMETER IS SPECIFIED, MATCHING DATA WILL BE SELECTED
              EVEN IF IT IS EMBEDDED IN A LONGER NAME.

              RECORD WILL BE PRINTED BEFORE THE NEW RECORD.  THE SAVED

              UNDER THAT SEARCH ARGUMENT WILL BE SAVED AND PROCESSED
              IN THE SAME WAY.  ONLY THE LAST SAVED RECORD WILL BE

              STATEMENT MAY CAUSE RECORDS TO BE PRINTED IN A DIFFERENT

0             THE SKIP STATEMENT CAUSES RECORDS TO BE IGNORED.  THIS
              CAN BE USED TO THIN OUT RECORDS AND REDUCE THE NEED FOR
