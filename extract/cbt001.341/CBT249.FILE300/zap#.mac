)F FUNCTION
   The ZAP command is used to examine, dump, and modify any type of
   sequential, partitioned, or direct access dataset.
   Any recfm is accepted. This command is the TSO interactive
   equivalent of IBM's service aid 'IMASPZAP' or 'SUPERZAP'
)X SYNTAX
     ZAP 'dsname' VOLUME('serial') CRT NOT3270
         TERSE/VERBOSE
         NOLOG/LOG
         ALLOCDSN('dsntoalloc')
   REQUIRED: 'dsname'
   DEFAULTS:  TERSE, NOLOG
              No volume implies a cataloged dataset.
   NOTE:  Usage of the ALLOCDSN keyword is required only for the
          'dsname' of FORMAT4.DSCB.
)O OPERANDS
))'dsname' - The name of the dataset to be ZAP'd.
))VOLUME   - The volume serial on which the dataset resides. The volume
             must be online and resident or storage.
))CRT      - Conditions ZAP to display four lines on either side of the
             current position in the file.
))NOT3270  - Inhibits use of full screen display mode on a 3270-type
             terminal and implies line by line display mode.
))LOG      - Conditions ZAP to log to SYSOUT all ZAP transactions to
             the file. Note that ZAP may be put in the logging state
             after it has been entered by use of the LOG  command, and
             that use of any of the DUMP commands causes ZAP to
             automatically enter the logging state.
             The log goes to SYSOUT(A) unless ddname 'ZAPLOG' is
             pre-allocated to wherever you want it to go.
))NOLOG    - suppress the hardcopy log.
))ALLOCDSN - specifies the name of a cataloged dataset on the same
             volume as the one to be zapped.  ZAP will allocate this
             dataset, but open the one given in the first operand.
             Usage of this keyword is required for FORMAT4.DSCB
             references. Note that a FORMAT4.DSCB reference is a
             priviledged operation.
))TERSE /VERBOSE -
             Conditions ZAP to omit the positional 'WHERE'
             information when displaying a portion of the file.
))VERBOSE /TERSE -
             Conditions ZAP to give the positional 'WHERE'
             information when displaying a portion of the file.
