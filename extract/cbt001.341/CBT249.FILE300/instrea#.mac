)F FUNCTION -
  THE INSTREAM COMMAND ALLOCATES A TEMPORARY DATA
  SET FOR UTILITY CONTROL STATEMENTS, AND COPIES
  SUBSEQUENT CLIST OR TERMINAL INPUT TO THAT DATA SET.

  THE COPYING CONTINUES UNTIL AN 'END' STATEMENT
  IS ENCOUNTERED.  THIS IS USEFUL IN CLISTS THAT
  CALL UTILITY PROGRAMS THAT REQUIRE 80-CHARACTER
  CONTROL STATEMENT INPUT.  SINCE THE CONTROL STATEMENTS
  ARE PART OF THE CLIST, THEIR CONTENTS CAN BE SET BY
  VARIABLES IN THE CLIST.

  AN EXAMPLE OF A CLIST THAT USES INSTREAM
     PROC 0 CC(A)
     FREE FI(SYSIN)
     INSTREAM
     X PRINT PREFORM=&CC.
     END
     CALL 'SYS1.LINKLIB(IEBPTPCH)'

  NOTE - CLIST STATEMENTS THAT ARE INDENTED ARE
  LEFT-JUSTIFIED AT THE TIME THEY ARE EXECUTED, SO
  CONTROL STATEMENTS THAT REQUIRE LEADING BLANKS
  REQUIRE SPECIAL HANDLING.  SEE OPERAND(NOTES).
)X SYNTAX  -
         INSTREAM   FILE('DDNAME')   END('STRING')  BLKSIZE('SIZE')
                    REUSE   CONTIN   INSERT
  REQUIRED - NONE
  DEFAULTS - FILE(SYSIN) END(END) BLKSIZE(400)
  ALIAS    - NONE
)O OPERANDS -
))FILE('DDNAME') - THE DDNAME TO WHICH THE NEW TEMPORARY
             DATA SET IS TO BE ALLOCATED.  IF NOT SPECIFIED,
             FILE(SYSIN) IS USED.  THE DDNAME MUST NOT BE
             CURRENTLY ALLOCATED, UNLESS 'REUSE' IS SPECIFIED.
))REUSE    - THIS KEYWORD INDICATES THAT IF THE DDNAME IS
             CURRENTLY ALLOCATED, IT IS TO BE FREED AND THEN
             RE-ALLOCATED TO THE NEW TEMPORARY DATA SET.
))BLOCK('SIZE') - THE BLOCKSIZE OF THE TEMPORARY DATA SET.
             IF NOT SPECIFIED, 400 IS USED.
))END('STRING') - THE STRING THAT WILL REPLACE 'END' AS THE
             DELIMITER OF THE INPUT DATA.
))INSERT   - THIS KEYWORD SPECIFIES THAT IF AN INPUT LINE
             STARTS WITH THE CHARACTERS 'I' OR 'IN' OR 'INSERT'
             FOLLOWED BY A BLANK, ONLY THE DATA FOLLOWING THE
             BLANK WILL BE COPIED.  THIS ALLOWS YOU TO INDENT
             YOUR CLIST AND STILL CONTROL LEADING BLANKS IN YOUR
             INPUT DATA.
))CONTIN   - THIS KEYWORD INDICATES THAT THE FIRST BYTE OF DATA
             IN EACH INPUT LINE IS TO BE PUT IN COLUMN 72, AND
             BYTES 2 THRU 72 SHIFTED OVER TO 1 THRI 71.
             USEFUL IF THE UTILITY PROGRAM USES COLUMN 72
             FOR CONTINUATION.
))NOTES    - THIS IS NOT AN OPERAND, BUT SOME AIDS TO USING
             THE INSTREAM COMMAND.
             ... LEADING BLANKS ...
             LEADING BLANKS ARE NORMALLY REMOVED FROM A
             CLIST STATEMENT AT THE TIME IT IS EXECUTED.
             THIS CAN BE PREVENTED BY PLACING THE STATEMENT
             BETWEEN A 'DATA' AND 'ENDDATA' STATEMENT (SEE
             THE TSO COMMAND LANGUAGE REFERENCE MANUAL).
             THESE TWO STATEMENTS WILL BE INVISIBLE TO INSTREAM
             AND NOT COPIED TO THE TEMPORARY DATA SET.
             ANOTHER WAY TO COPY A LEADING BLANK IS TO USE THE
             'INSERT' KEYWORD AND BEGIN EACH INPUT LINE WITH
             THE WORD 'INSERT' FOLLOWED BY A BLANK FOLLOWED BY
             YOUR LEADING BLANK(S).  THIS GIVES YOU THE FREEDOM
             TO CODE YOR CLIST WITH INDENTATION FOR READABILITY.
