  MESSAGE-NOTE:
                  IN ORDER TO GIVE THE USER MORE CONTROL OVER THE
               SCREEN FORMAT, KOMM SCANS THE MESSAGE AND DOES THIS:

                  UPON ENCOUNTERING A Ö (CENT SIGN), KOMM REMOVES
               THE Ö (CENT SIGN) FROM THE MESSAGE AND TRANSLATES
               THE FOLLOWING CHARACTER TO A 3270 CONTROL CHARACTER
               OR A TSO PROBLEM CHARACTER, USING THE TABLE BELOW:

          3270 CONTROL:                  TSO PROBLEM CHARS:
    CHAR   TRANSLATION   HEX          CHAR   TRANSLATION   HEX
     _         IC       X'13'          <         (        X'4D'
     -         SBA      X'11'          >         )        X'5D'
     ×         SF       X'1D'          "         '        X'7D'
     *         NULL     X'00'          /         ^        X'5F'
     #         RA       X'3C'          Ö         Ö        X'4A'
     @         EUA      X'12'          A    (BROKEN BAR)  X'6A'
     .         PT       X'05'          B         ,        X'6B'

            OTHERS SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED AS DEFINED AT THIS TIME,
        BUT ARE GENERALLY TRANSLATED TO THEMSELVES. THE PROBLEM CHARS
        ARE TRANSLATED BECAUSE ALL 3270 CHARS ARE USED IN ADDRESS
        SPECIFICATION ETC. BUT SOME HAVE SPECIAL SIGNIFICANCE TO TSO.

  EXAMPLE:
            KOMM CLEAR MESS(10,40,'Ö#  Z')
        WOULD CLEAR THE SCREEN AND FILL FROM LINE 10, COLUMN 40 TO
        THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN WITH THE LETTER 'Z'.
