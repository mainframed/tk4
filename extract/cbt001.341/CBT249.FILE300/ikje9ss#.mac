)F FUNCTION -
  SAVESHR IS JUST LIKE SAVE EXCEPT IT ALLOCATES THE SAVE DATA SET
  SHARED INSTEAD OF OLD WHEN THE SAVE DATA SET IS A PDS.

  SAVESHR IS SERIALIZED WITH SAVESHR'S DONE BY OTHER USERS ON THE
  SAME DATA SET, AND WITH SPF FUNCTIONS DONE BY OTHER USERS ON THE
  SAME DATA SET, SO SIMULTANEOUS UPDATE OF THE PDS DOES NOT OCCUR.
  BUT SIMULTANEOUS UPDATE (UNPREDICTABLE RESULTS) COULD OCCUR IF
  ANOTHER USER OR JOB WRITES INTO THE PDS DISP=SHR USING SOMETHING
  OTHER THAN SPF OR THE SAVESHR SUBCOMMAND OF EDIT, AT THE SAME TIME.

  NOTE THAT IF ANOTHER USER IS DOING A REGULAR SAVE SUBCOMMAND AT THE
  SAME TIME YOU ENTER A SAVESHR SUBCOMMAND TO THE SAME PDS, ONE OF YOU
  WILL GET A MESSAGE TELLING YOU THE DATA SET CANNOT BE ALLOCATED,
  BECAUSE THE REGULAR SAVE SUBCOMMAND REQUESTS EXCLUSIVE CONTROL OF
  THE DATA SET.

                    OR
                UNNUM/UNN
  REQUIRED - NONE
  DEFAULTS - 'DSNAME' DEFAULTS TO THE DATA SET NAME SPECIFIED WITH THE
             EDIT COMMAND.
           - BOTH 'NEW-LINE' AND 'INCREM' DEFAULT TO 10 .
             'OLD-LINE' DEFAULTS TO THE FIRST LINE IN THE DATA SET.
             'END-LINE' DEFAULTS TO THE LAST LINE IN THE DATA SET.
  ALIAS    - S
  NOTE     - 'NEW-LINE' IS REQUIRED IF 'INCREM' IS SPECIFIED.
             BOTH ARE REQUIRED IF 'OLD-LINE' IS SPECIFIED.
             SPECIFICATION OF 'END-LINE' REQUIRES ALL OTHER OPERANDS
             TO BE SPECIFIED.
  NOTE     - 'DSNAME'/* IS REQUIRED IF EITHER RENUM OR UNNUM IS
             SPECIFIED.
  NOTE     - SAVE MUST BE ISSUED IF THE USER WANTS TO RETAIN A NEW DATA
             SET CREATED BY THE EDIT COMMAND, OR TO INCORPORATE INTO AN
             OLD DATA SET CHANGES MADE UNDER EDIT.
)O OPERANDS -
  'DSNAME' - NAME TO BE ASSIGNED THE RETAINED COPY. IF 'DSNAME'
           + SPECIFIES AN EXISTING PARTITIONED DATA SET (PDS), WITHOUT
             SPECIFYING MEMBER NAME, MEMBER NAME 'TEMPNAME' IS USED.
             A NEW MEMBER IS CREATED IF NAMED MEMBER DOES NOT EXIST.
           + SPECIFIES AN EXISTING SEQUENTIAL DATA SET OR PDS MEMBER
             DIFFERENT FROM THAT SPECIFIED WITH THE EDIT COMMAND, THE
             USER WILL BE NOTIFIED. ANOTHER DATA SET NAME OR A CARRIAGE
             RETURN CAN BE ENTERED. A CARRIAGE RETURN WILL CAUSE THE
             SPECIFIED DATA SET OR PDS MEMBER TO BE REPLACED.
           + SPECIFIES A DATA SET WHICH DOES NOT ALREADY EXIST, A NEW
             SEQUENTIAL DATA SET, OR PDS IF A MEMBER NAME IS STATED,
             WILL BE ALLOCATED.
  'RENUM'  - SPECIFIES THE RENUMBERING OF ALL OR PART OF THE EDIT
             DATA SET OR THE ASSIGNING OF A NUMBER TO EACH LINE OF
             AN UNNUMBERED DATA SET
  'UNNUM'  - SPECIFIES THE REMOVAL OF LINE NUMBERS FROM LINES OF THE
             EDIT DATA SET
  'NEW-LINE'
           - THE NUMBER TO BE ASSIGNED TO THE FIRST LINE PROCESSED.
  'INCREM' - SPECIFIES THE INCREMENT TO BE USED IN RENUMBERING.
  'OLD-LINE'
           - SPECIFIES A LINE NUMBER IN THE DATA SET. NEW LINE NUMBERS
             ARE TO BE ASSIGNED BEGINNING WITH THIS LINE. THIS OPERAND
             IS VALID ONLY WITH LINE NUMBERED DATA SETS. IF THIS
             OPERAND IS OMITTED, THE ENTIRE DATA SET IS RENUMBERED.
  'END-LINE'
           - SPECIFIES A LINE NUMBER IN THE DATA SET. THIS OPERAND IS
             VALID ONLY WITH LINE-NUMBERED DATA SETS. NEW LINE NUMBERS
             ARE TO BE ASSIGNED BEGINNING AT 'OLD-LINE' AND
             ENDING AT 'END-LINE'. IF THIS OPERAND IS OMITTED,
             RENUMBERING APPLIES FROM 'OLD-LINE' THROUGH THE END
             OF THE DATA SET.
