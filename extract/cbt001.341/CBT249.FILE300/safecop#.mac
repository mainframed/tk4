)F Function -

     SAFECOPY is a copy command which enables several users to update
     the same dataset simultaneously, without conflicting with each
     other or with users who are reading the dataset.  SAFECOPY is
     especially useful in CLISTs which write to a common dataset.

)X Syntax -

     REQUIRED:  1.  FROMDSNAME or FROMDATASET or FROMFILE or FROMDDNAME
                2.  TODSNAME or TODATASET or TOFILE or TODDNAME

     DEFAULTS:  1.  OLD

)O Operands -

))FROMDSNAME(dsname×*)
    The name of the dataset from which the data is to be copied.
    'dsname' may be the name of a member of a partitioned dataset.
    The use of an asterisk (*) indicates that the data will come from
    the timesharing terminal, or from instream data in a CLIST.

    NOTE:  When using FROMDSNAME(*), the end of the input data is
           signalled by a null line, or the characters 'END'.
           See examples in this HELP document.

))FROMDATASET(dsname×*)
    Means the same thing as FROMDSNAME.

))FROMFILE(filename)
    The name of the preallocated file from which the data is to be
    copied.  Some files are allocated automatically during LOGON.
    After LOGON, you can allocate files dynamically with the ALLOCATE
    command.

))FROMDDNAME(filename)
    Means the same thing as FROMFILE.

))TODSNAME(dsname)
    The name of the dataset to which the data is to be copied.
    'dsname' may be the name of a member of a partitioned dataset.

    NOTE:  This dataset may be shared with other users.

))TODATASET(dsname)
    Means the same thing as TODSNAME.

))TOFILE(filename)
    The name of the preallocated file to which the data is to be
    copied.  Some files are allocated automatically during LOGON.
    After LOGON, you can allocate files dynamically with the ALLOCATE
    command.

))TODDNAME(filename)
    Means the same thing as TOFILE.

))OLD
    The data copied into the output dataset will REPLACE data which is
    already there.  You have the choice of OLD or MOD.

    NOTE:  OLD is the default.

))MOD
    The data copied into the output dataset will be ADDED ONTO THE END
    of data which is already there.  You have the choice of OLD or MOD.

    NOTE:  MOD is invalid if you are copying into a member of a
           partitioned dataset.

))NUM
    Indicates that the data contains line numbers.  When copying data,
    the line numbers may be physically moved to conform to the output
    dataset's record format.

))NONUM
    Indicates that the data does not contain line numbers.  All data
    will be copied as is, without special processing of line number
    fields.

    NOTE:  NONUM is the default.


))EXAMPLES -

  1.  Copy MYSET.TEXT into member MEM1 of 'YOURID.YOURLIB.TEXT':

        SAFEC  FROMDS(myset.text)  TODS('yourid.yourlib.text(mem1)')


  2.  Add data from MYSET.DATA onto the end of data already in
     'YOURID.YOURSET.DATA':

        SAFEC  FROMDS(myset.data)  TODS('yourid.yourset.data')  MOD


  3.  Copy data from MYSET.TEXT to file name OUTDD2:

        SAFEC  FROMDS(myset.text)  TOFILE(outdd2)


  4.  CLIST to write three-line message, including your userid,
      current date and time onto the end of 'YOURID.USAGE.DATA'.
      The end of instream data is indicated by the word 'END':

        PROC 0
        SAFECOPY FROMDSNAME(*) TODATASET('yourid.usage.data') MOD
        DATA ADDED BY &SYSUID
        DATA WAS ADDED ON &SYSDATE
        AT &SYSTIME
        END
        EXIT

))Messages issued by SAFECOPY are:

))SCY0000I - COPY OPERATION COMPLETE
           Normal end of copy operation.

))SCY0004E - 'TO' DATASET OR FILE NAME IS REQUIRED
           Either TODATASET or TODSNAME or TOFILE or TODDNAME must be
           used.

))SCY0008E - UNABLE TO ALLOCATE 'TO' FILE/DD NAME
           SAFECOPY was not able to use the name designated in the
           TOFILE or TODDNAME operand.  This message should be
           preceeded by another explaining the cause of the failure.

))SCY000CE - UNABLE TO ALLOCATE 'TO' DATASET NAME
           SAFECOPY was not able to use the name designated in the
           TODSNAME or TODATASET operand.  This message should be
           preceeded by another explaining the cause of the failure.

))SCY0010E - UNABLE TO ALLOCATE 'FROM' DATASET NAME
           SAFECOPY was not able to use the name designated in the
           FROMDSNAME or FROMDATASET operand.  This message should be

           preceeded by another explaining the cause of the failure.

))SCY0018E - 'FROM' DATASET OR FILE NAME IS REQUIRED
           Either FROMDATASET or FROMDSNAME or FROMFILE or FROMDDNAME
           must be used.

))SCY001CE - UNABLE TO OPEN INPUT FILE
           Input file failed to open.  Call systems programmer.

))SCY0020E - UNABLE TO OPEN OUTPUT FILE
           Output file failed to open.  Call systems programmer.

))SCY0024E - UNABLE TO CLOSE INPUT FILE
           Input file failed to close.  LOGOFF, then call systems
           programmer.

))SCY0028E - UNABLE TO CLOSE OUTPUT FILE

           Flow of data from the terminal was interrupted.  Retry.  If
           problem persists, call systems programmer.

))SCY0030E - UNABLE TO PROCESS INPUT OR OUTPUT RECORD FORMAT
           Input and output formats must be fixed or variable.  One or
           both are not.  This condition will also occur if the TOFILE
           or TODDNAME operand is used, and the file name it
           designates has been allocated to the terminal.

))SCY0034E - UNABLE TO CONVERT FROM INPUT TO OUTPUT RECORD FORMAT
           Internal error.  Call systems programmer.

))SCY0038E - 'TO' MEMBER NAME IS REQUIRED.  DATASET IS PARTITIONED.
           If the dataset designated by TODSNAME or TODATASET is
           partitioned, or if the dataset allocated to the file name
           designated by TOFILE or TODD is partitioned, a member name
           must be supplied.

))SCY003CE - 'FROM' MEMBER NAME IS REQUIRED.  DATSET IS PARTITIONED.
           If the dataset designated by FROMDSNAME or FROMDATASET is
           partitioned, or if the dataset allocated to the file name

           name must be supplied.

))SCY0040E - 'MOD' IS INVALID WHEN COPYING INTO A PARTITIONED DATASET
           MOD is only valid for adding data onto the end of a
           sequential dataset.

))SCY0044E - 'FROM' AND 'TO' DATASETS MUST BE DIFFERENT
           Data cannot be copied from a dataset onto itself.  Also,
           data cannot be copied from one member of a partitioned
           dataset to another member of the same partitioned dataset.
           An intermediate dataset must be used.

))SCY0048E - RECORD TOO SHORT FOR LINE NUMBER.  USE 'NONUM.'
           The record length of the input or output output data is too
           short to contain an 8-digit line number.  Minimum record
           length for fixed length records is 8.  Minimum length for
           variable length records is 12.  Data may still be copied,
           as is, by using the 'NONUM' operand.
