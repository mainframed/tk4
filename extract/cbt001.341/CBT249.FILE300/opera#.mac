)F FUNCTION -
  THE OPERA COMMAND ALLOWS ANY CONSOLE COMMAND TO BE
  ENTERED FROM A TSO TERMINAL.

  NOTE: JES2 COMMANDS ($ COMMANDS) SHOULD NOT BE ENTERED.
  OUTPUT FROM JES2 DISPLAY COMMANDS WILL NOT BE SENT TO
  THE TERMINAL.

  MANY MVS COMMANDS DO NOT RECOGNIZE A TSO TERMINAL AS A
  VALID PLACE TO RESPOND, SO YOU WILL NOT SEE THE OUTPUT.
  FOR EXAMPLE, DONT TRY D U,,,XXX,1 BECAUSE THE DISPLAY
  WILL NOT BE SENT TO THE TERMINAL.

  NOTE: THIS IS AN APF-AUTHORIZED COMMAND, AND THEREFORE
  WILL NOT RUN PROPERLY UNDER SPF.  YOU MUST EXIT SPF TO
  'READY' MODE BEFORE USING THIS COMMAND.
