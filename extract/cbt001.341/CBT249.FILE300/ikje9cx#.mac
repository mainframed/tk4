)F FUNCTION -
  THE CHANGEX SUBCOMMAND IS USED TO MODIFY A CHARACTER-STRING IN A
  LINE OR RANGE OF LINES USING HEXADECIMAL STRINGS.  THE SYNTAX IS
  IDENTICAL TO THE 'CHANGE' SUBCOMMAND, EXCEPT THE TEXT STRINGS
  ARE HEXADECIMAL REPRESENTATIONS OF THE STRINGS TO BE CHANGED.
  HEX STRINGS MAY CONTAIN ONLY THE CHARACTERS 0 THRU 9 AND A THRU F.
  HEX STRINGS WITH AN ODD NUMBER OF DIGITS ARE PREFIXED WITH A 0.
)X SYNTAX -
         CHANGEX  'LINE-SPEC'  'STRING'  OR  =TEXT1=TEXT2= ALL
  REQUIRED - 'STRING' OR =TEXT1=TEXT2
  DEFAULTS - 'LINE-SPEC' DEFAULTS TO * .
  ALIAS    - CX
)O OPERANDS -
  'LINE-SPEC'
           - * FOR THE CURRENT LINE. * 'COUNT1' OR 'LINENUM1,LINENUM2'
             FOR A RANGE OF LINES. 'LINENUM' FOR A PARTICULAR LINE.
  'STRING'
           - A SEARCH FOR THE SPECIFIED CHARACTER STRING IS MADE IN THE
             LINE(S) SPECIFIED. THE FIRST LINE IN WHICH IT IS FOUND IS
             PRINTED UP TO THE STRING, AND THE USER COMPLETES THE LINE,
             BUT WITH ACTUAL CHARACTERS, NOT HEX STRINGS.
  '=TEXT1=TEXT2='ALL
           - = MAY BE ANY NON-NUMERIC CHARACTER EXCEPT BLANK, COMMA,
             TAB,PARENTHESIS,ASTERISK,APOSTROPHE,OR SEMICOLON. IT
             DELIMITS THE STRING AND CANNOT APPEAR WITHIN THE CHARACTER
             STRINGS TEXT1 AND TEXT2. THE LINE OR RANGE OF LINES IS
             SEARCHED FOR TEXT1, WHICH, IF FOUND, IS REPLACED BY TEXT2.
             THE KEYWORD 'ALL' IS OPTIONAL AND CAUSES EVERY OCCURRENCE
             OF TEXT1 TO BE REPLACED IN THE LINE(S). EXAMPLES -
             ==TEXT2=  TEXT2 WILL BE INSERTED IN FRONT OF THE LINE(S).
             =TEXT1==  TEXT1 WILL BE DELETED FROM THE LINE(S).
