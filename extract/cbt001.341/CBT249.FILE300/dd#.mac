)F FUNCTION -
  THE DD COMMAND IS LIKE A SHORTHAND 'ALLOC' COMMAND.

  IT IS SIMILAR TO THE ALLOC COMMAND EXCEPT THE FILENAME
  AND DATASET NAME ARE REQUIRED POSITIONAL OPERANDS INSTEAD
  OF KEYWORD OPERANDS.  FOR EXAMPLE, INSTEAD OF TYPING
     ALLOC FI(SYSPROC) DA(CLIST) SHR
  YOU CAN TYPE
     DD SYSPROC CLIST

  IF THE FILENAME IS CURRENTLY ALLOCATED, IT WILL BE FREED AND REUSED.

  NOT ALL OPERANDS OF ALLOC ARE AVAILABLE IN THE DD COMMAND.
  SOME OPERANDS ARE NEW FUNCTIONS NOT AVAILABLE IN THE ALLOC COMMAND.

  REQUIRED - 'FILENAME', 'DSNAME'
  DEFAULTS - SHR (UNLESS SPACE, DIR, OR TRACKS/CYL/BLOCKS SPECIFIED,
                  IN WHICH CASE THE DEFAULT IS NEW)
             FOR NEW DATA SETS, IF 'SPACE' IS NOT SPECIFIED AND
             SPACE TYPE (TRACKS, CYL, BLOCK) IS NOT SPECIFIED, THEN
             THE SYSTEM DEFAULT SPACE VALUES WILL BE USED.
             THESE ARE CURRENTLY SPACE(10,50) BLOCKS(1000) RLSE.
  ALIAS    - NONE
)O OPERANDS -
  'FILENAME' - THE FILENAME TO BE ALLOCATED.
  'DSNAME'  -  THE DATA SET(S) TO BE ALLOCATED TO THE FILENAME.
               IF MORE THAN ONE IS SPECIFIED, THEY WILL BE CONCATENATED.
               IF '*' IS SPECIFIED, THE TERMINAL WILL BE ALLOCATED.
               IF 'SYSOUT' OR 'SYSOUT(X)', A SYSOUT FILE WILL BE
               ALLOCATED (X IS SYSOUT CLASS, AND CAN BE A THRU Z OR
               #0 THRU #9 WHICH ARE TREATED AS 0 THRU 9).
               IF 'DUMMY', A DUMMY FILE WILL BE ALLOCATED.
               IF '$', A TEMPORARY DATA SET WILL BE ALLOCATED.
               IF '$.NAME', A TEMPORARY DATA SET WILL BE ALLOCATED,
               WITH 'NAME' APPENDED TO THE GENERATED DSNAME.
))OLD       -  THE DATA SET IS TO BE ALLOCATED EXCLUSIVELY
               TO THIS SESSION.
))MOD       -  THE DATA SET IS TO BE ALLOCATED EXCLUSIVELY
               TO THIS SESSION, TO APPEND MORE DATA.
))NEW       -  THE DATA SET IS TO BE CREATED.
))UNIT('UNIT') - THE UNIT NAME OF THE DEVICE ON WHICH THE DATA SET
               RESIDES, IF NOT CATALOGED.
))VOLUME('VOLUME') - THE VOLUME SERIAL ON WHICH THE DATA SET
               RESIDES, IF NOT CATALOGED.
))USING('ATTR-LIST-NAME') - THE NAME OF AN ATTRIBUTE LIST
               OF DCB PARAMETERS TO BE MERGED WITH THE DATA SET.
))DATASET   -  THIS KEYWORD IS NEEDED ONLY IF YOU WISH TO
               ALLOCATE A DATA SET HAVING THE NAME 'SYSOUT'
               OR 'DUMMY' OR '$' OR '$.NAME'.  THIS KEYWORD
               FORCES THE COMMAND TO USE THE SECOND OPERAND
               AS A DSNAME IF IT IS ANY OF THESE NAMES.
))SPACE('PRIME','SEC') - THE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY AMOUNTS OF SPACE
               TO BE ALLOCATED TO A NEW DATA SET ON DISK.
))TRACKS    -  THE VALUES IN THE 'SPACE' OPERANDS ARE IN TRACKS.
))CYLINDERS -  THE VALUES IN THE 'SPACE' OPERANDS ARE IN CYLINDERS.
))BLOCKS('SIZE')  -  THE VALUES IN THE 'SPACE' OPERANDS ARE IN BLOCKS
               AND THIS IS THE SIZE OF A BLOCK.
))DSORG(PS/PO/DA/PSU/POU/DAU) - DCB DSORG.
))RECFM('X') - DCB RECORD FORMAT.
))LRECL('N') - DCB LOGICAL RECORD LENGTH.
))BLKSIZE('N') - DCB BLOCK SIZE.
))FORM('ID') - SYSOUT FORM NUMBER.
))FCB('ID')  - SYSOUT FORMS CONTROL BUFFER IMAGE ID.
))HOLD       - SYSOUT TO BE HELD.
))DEST('ID') - SYSOUT DESTINATION.
))COPIES('NUMBER') - SYSOUT COPIES (1 TO 99).
