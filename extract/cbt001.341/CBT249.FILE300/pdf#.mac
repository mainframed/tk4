))option   - An initial option that may be entered to bypass the first
             display of the primary option menu and go directly to the
             option you select.  (This is not a keyword parameter.
             Simply enter the option number, or omit to display the
             primary option menu.)  For example, typing "PDF 3.2" in
             TSO will take you directly to the ISPF/PDF dataset utility
             option.

))TEST     - PDF is to be run in TEST mode.  Test mode includes:
              1. re-reading from disk all panels and messages.  This
                 enhances the ability to test panels and messages in
                 the same PDF session that they are modified.
              2. Disabling ABEND recovery.  This allows ABENDs to be
                 tracked down using TSO TEST.
              3. Disabling ATTENTION key handling.  This allows the
                 ATTENTION key to be used to enter TSO TEST.

))TESTX    - PDF is to be run in TEST mode EXTENDED.  In addition to
             TEST mode, any lines that are written to the LOG file are
             also displayed on the display screen.

))TRACE    - PDF is to be run in TRACE mode.  TRACE mode includes all
             of the functions of TEST mode.  In addition, all ISPEXEC
             service invocations from a dialog will be logged.

))TRACEX   - PDF is to be run in TRACE mode EXTENDED.  In addition to
             TRACE mode, any lines that are written to the LOG file are
             also displayed on the display screen.
