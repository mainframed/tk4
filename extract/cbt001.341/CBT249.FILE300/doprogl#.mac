*)F       THE # COMMAND CAN BE USED IN PLACE OF THE CALL COMMAND
*         FOR PROGRAMS THAT ARE IN THE 'SYS1.LINKLIB' DATA SETS;
*         THIS INCLUDES ALL COMPILERS AND UTILITIES AS WELL AS
*         MEMOREX UTILITIES SUCH AS LISTPDS AND DSUTIL.
*
*         ADVANTAGES OF THE # COMMAND OVER CALL:
*         1) THE # COMMAND REQUIRES NO DYNAMIC DD CARD NOR
*            ALLOCATION AND IS, THEREFORE, CONSIDERABLY FASTER;
*         2) THE # COMMAND SIMPLIFIES SYNTAX AND REQUIRES LESS TYPING;
*         3) THE # COMMAND ALLOWS USE OF PROGRAMS IN ANY OF THE LINKLIB
*            DATA SETS, WITHOUT KNOWING WHICH OF THE DATA SETS THE
*            PROGRAM IS IN.
*         DISADVANTAGES OF THE # COMMAND:
*         THE ONLY DISADVANTAGE OF THE # COMMAND IS THAT THE PROGRAM
*         BEING CALLED MUST BE IN A LINKLIB DATA SET; HENCE,
*         TO CALL A USER'S PROGRAM FROM HIS LIBRARY, THE CALL COMMAND
*         MUST STILL BE USED.
*)X       THE SYNTAX OF THE # COMMAND IS AS FOLLOWS:
*         # PROGRAM 'PARM'
*         WHERE PROGRAM IS THE NAME OF THE PROGRAM TO BE EXECUTED AND
*         'PARM' IS AN OPTIONAL PARM FIELD OF UP TO 100 CHARACTERS
*         WHICH IS TO BE PASSED TO THE PROGRAM.
*)O       THE OPERANDS OF THE # COMMAND ARE:
*         PROGRAM - THE 1 TO 8 CHARACTER NAME OF THE PROGRAM TO BE
*                   EXECUTED.
*         'PARM'  - THE OPTIONAL 0 TO 100 CHARACTER STRING, ENCLOSED IN
*                   QUOTES, REPRESENTING THE PARAMETER TO BE PASSED TO
*                   THE PROGRAM.
*
*         EXAMPLE - INVOKING MRCLEAN FOR VOLS PUBDA1 AND TSODA1
*         # MRCLEAN 'PUBDA1,TSODA1'
*
*         EXAMPLE - INVOKING ASSEMBLER F WITH PARMS OF TEST AND RENT
*         # IEUASM 'TEST,RENT'
