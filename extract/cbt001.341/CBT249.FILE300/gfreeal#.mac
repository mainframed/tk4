)F Function -

    FREEALL is a command for freeing (unallocating) several unused
    files all at once.  This command should be executed from time to
    time during a TSO session to reduce session overhead.

    FREEALL will free all files except:
        1.  Those which are in use (for example, open datasets).
        2.  Those which are excepted from processing by the computer
            center (see the SYSMASKS operand).
        3.  Those which you designate not to be unallocated (see
            the EXCEPT operand, and the NOTEMP, NODUMMY, NOSYSOUT
            and NOTERM operands).

             SYSMASKS
             NOLIST × LIST
             CONCATS × NOCONCATS
             DYNAM × ALL
             TEMP × NOTEMP  (OR  SCRATCH × NOSCRATCH)
             DUMMY × NODUMMY
             SYSOUT × NOSYSOUT
             TERM × NOTERM

    ALIAS:  FA

    REQUIRED:  None
    DEFAULTS:  NOLIST, CONCATS, DYNAM, TEMP (OR SCRATCH),
               DUMMY, SYSOUT, TERM


)O Operands -

))LIST -
    List the names and types of all files which are freed.  List
    the dataset names associated with each file (for concaten-
    ations:  list the first dataset name).  Default: NOLIST
))NOLIST -
    Don't list the names of files which are freed.  Default:
    NOLIST

))CONCATS -
    Unallocate concatenations.  (Concatenations are groupings
    of several datasets into a single logical file.)
    Default: CONCATS
))NOCONCATS -
    Don't unallocate concatenations.  Default: CONCATS

))DYNAM -
    Only free files which have been allocated during the current
    TSO session.  Do not free files which were allocated during
    initial LOGON processing, or with JCL when running TSO in
    batch.  Default: DYNAM
))ALL -
    Free files which have been allocated during the current TSO
    session, and also files which were allocated during initial
    LOGON processing, or with JCL when running TSO in batch.
    Default: DYNAM

))SYSMASKS -
    Show the list of file name (ddname) masks which are
    installation defined.  These file names will always be
    excepted from unallocation processing.

    Note:  When SYSMASKS is used, all other operands are ignored.
           Only a list will be produced.  No files will be freed.

))EXCEPT(mask1,mask2,...)
    This operand instructs FREEALL not to free files whose
    names match the masks in the parentheses.  See EXAMPLES,
    below.

))TEMP
    Temporary datasets (those which have system-assigned dataset
    names) will be freed.  Default: TEMP
))NOTEMP
    Temporary datasets (those which have system-assigned dataset
    names) will not be freed.  Default: TEMP

))SCRATCH
    Means the same thing as TEMP.
))NOSCRATCH
    Means the same thing as NOTEMP.

))DUMMY
    Dummy files will be freed.  Default: DUMMY
))NODUMMY
    Dummy files will not be freed.  Default: DUMMY

))SYSOUT
    Files allocated to JES output (printers, punches, TSO hold
    queues, etc.) will be freed.  Default: SYSOUT
))NOSYSOUT
    Files allocated to JES output (printers, punches, TSO hold
    queues, etc.) will not be freed.  Default: SYSOUT

))TERM
    Files allocated to the TSO terminal will be freed.  Default: TERM
))NOTERM
    Files allocated to the TSO terminal will not be freed.
    Default: TERM

))EXAMPLES:

    1.  FA

          Frees all files not in use which were dynamically
          allocated during the TSO session.

    2.  FA  L

          Same as example 1, but also lists the file names.

    3.  FA  L  EXCEPT(AUDITOUT,FT22F001)

          Frees and lists all files not in use which were
          dynamically allocated during the TSO session, except
          for files FT22F001 and AUDITOUT.

    4.  FA  L  EXCEPT(AUDIT-,FT**F001)

          Same as Example 3, except doesn't free ANY file name
          beginning with the letters 'AUDIT', nor any file
          name beginning with 'FT', followed by two characters,
          then followed by 'F001'.

          Note: '*' is a placeholder.
                '-' means anything is a match from that point on.

    5.  FA  L  EXCEPT(***Z-)

          Frees and lists all files not in use which were
          dynamically allocated during the TSO session, except
          for any file name with a 'Z' in the fourth position.

    6.  FA  SYSMASKS
          Creates a listing of the installation defined file
          name masks.  Does not free any files.

    7.  FA  NOCONCATS
          Frees all files not in use which were dynamically
          allocated during the TSO session, except for
          concatenations.

    8.  FA  NOTERM  NOSYSOUT
          Frees all files not in use except those allocated to
          the terminal, and those which are going directly to
          JES output (printers, punches, TSO hold queues, etc.).

    9.  FA  NOTEMP  NODUMMY
          Frees all files not in use except those allocated to
          temporary datasets and dummy files.
