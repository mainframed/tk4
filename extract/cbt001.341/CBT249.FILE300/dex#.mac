)F       FUNCTION
         DEX IS A HEX/DECIMAL CALCULATOR.
         IT IS STRICTLY 'FIXED-POINT' AND IGNORES OVERFLOW
            CONDITIONS.
)X       SYNTAX
         DEX WILL ACCEPT JUST ABOUT ANYTHING FOR INPUT.
         OPERATIONS THAT WILL BE ACCEPTED ARE:
            + - ADD;
            - - SUBTRACT
            * - MULTIPLY;
            / - DIVIDE.
            --- EXPONENTIATION IS NOT SUPPORTED --
         A SEMI-COLON (;) IS USED TO SEPARATE INPUT EQUATIONS.

         COMMAND SYNTAX:
           SYMBOL = VALUE;
           VALUE;
           EQUATION;
           (E.G.   A=23;126H;33+3233H-323.+7) ARE ALL VALID

         THE DEFAULT MODE IS DECIMAL.
           ALL HEX VALUES IN DECIMAL MODE MUST BE FOLLOWED BY
           THE CHARACTER 'H'.
           ALL DECIMAL VALUES IN HEX MODE MUST BE FOLLOWED
           BY THE CHARACTER '.'.

)O       OPERANDS AND COMMANDS
         /SORT - DISPLAY A SORTED SYMBOL TABLE
         /DUMP - DISPLAY THE SYMBOL TABLE
         /HEX  - SET MODE TO HEX
         /DEC  - SET MODE TO DECIMAL
         /DISP - DISPLAY ALL EQUATIONS AS PROCESSED
         /NODISP-DISPLAY ONLY THE RESULT
         /DELETE-DELETE A SYMBOL FROM THE SYMBOL TABLE

         EXAMPLES OF INPUT:
         /HEX;START=0ABBC0;ERROR=0AC000;OFFSET=ERROR-START;/SORT
         (NOTE THAT HEX VALUES BEGINNING WITH A CHARACTER
          MUST BE PRECEEDED BY A ZERO TO PREVENT THEIR
          BEING INTERPRETED AS VARIABLES).

         --- NOTES --
           1) SEMI-COLONS SEPARATE EQUATIONS;
           2) DIVISION BY ZERO YIELDS AN ERROR MESSAGE;
           3) 0FFFFFFFFH + 1 YIELDS ZERO.
           4) A PRIMATIVE LOOPING CAPABILITY IS PRESENT,
              IF NEW INPUT IS NOT ENTERED AFTER ANY DISPLAY,
              THE LAST INPUT WILL BE USED.
              EXAMPLE:
               YOU ENTER: A = 3;
               DEX RETURNS:   3 00000003
               YOU ENTER: A = A*3;
               DEX RETURNS:   9 00000009
               YOU ENTER: <CARRIER RETURN OR SHIFT/ENTER>
               DEX RETURNS: ENTER EQUATION(S) OR 'END'
               YOU ENTER: <CARRIER RETURN OR SHIFT/ENTER>
               DEX RETURNS:  27 0000001B
            ETC...
           5) THE CURRENT RESULT IS KEPT IN THE SYMBOL '*'...
              THIS MEANS THAT TO GET THE CURRENT RESULT TIMES 2
              ONE COULD ENTER **2;
              TO GET THE CURRENT RESULT TO THE THIRD POWER, ONE
              COULD ENTER *****.
