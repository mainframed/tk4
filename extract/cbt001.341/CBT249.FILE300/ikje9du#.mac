=DUP
)F FUNCTION -
  THE DUP SUBCOMMAND DUPLICATES A LINE ONE OR MORE TIMES.

  THE OPERANDS SPECIFY THE LINE NUMBER TO BE DUPLICATED.
  THE LOCATION WHERE THE DUPLICATES ARE TO BE INSERTED,
  HOW MANY DUPLICATES TO MAKE, AND THE LINE NUMBER INCREMENT
  TO USE WHEN INSERTING THE NEW LINES.

  IF THE EXISTING SEQUENCE NUMBERS DO NOT ALLOW THE SPECIFIED
  NUMBER OF DUPLICATES TO BE INSERTED, THE DUPLICATING TERMINATES
  AND A MESSAGE IS ISSUED, UNLESS THE 'REPLACE' KEYWORD IS USED
  WHICH WILL CAUSE SOME EXISTING LINES TO BE DELETED IF NECESSARY.

  IF LINES 10 20 30 AND 40 EXIST AND YOU DUP 3 COPIES OF LINE 10
  TO LINE 15, YOU WILL CREATE LINES 15, 16, AND 17.  BUT IF YOU
  SPECIFY AN INCREMENT OF 10, YOU WILL CREATE LINES 15, 25, AND
  35, AND (SURPRISE) LINES 20 AND 30 REMAIN UNCHANGED.
  IF YOU SPECIFY AN INCREMENT OF 5, YOU WILL CREATE LINE 15 ONLY,
  THEN DUP WILL STOP BECAUSE THE NEXT INCREMENT YIELDS 20, WHICH
  ALREADY EXISTS.  IF YOU ALSO SPECIFIED REPLACE, LINE 20 WOULD
  BE REPLACED WITH THE DUPLICATED LINE AND DUP WOULD CONTINUE.

  DUP IS NOT AVAILABLE FOR UNNUMBERED DATA.
)X SYNTAX -
         DUP   'LINENUM1'  'LINENUM2'  'COPIES'  'INCREMENT'  I/R
  REQUIRED - NONE
  DEFAULTS - LINENUM1 -- CURRENT LINE
             LINENUM2 -- LINE AFTER LINENUM1
             INCREMENT -- 1
             I/R       -- I
             IF NO OPERANDS ARE SPECIFIED, THE CURRENT LINE
             WILL BE DUPLICATED RIGHT AFTER ITSELF ONE TIME.
  ALIAS    - NONE
)O OPERANDS -
  'LINENUM1'  - THE LINE NUMBER TO BE DUPLICATED.
                '*' MEANS THE CURRENT LINE.
  'LINENUM2'  - THE LINE NUMBER WHERE THE DUPLICATES ARE TO BE
                INSERTED.  IF AN EXISTING NUMBER IS SPECIFIED
                THEN THE LINE(S) WILL BE INSERTED AFTER IT.
                '*' MEANS THE CURRENT LINE (NOT NECESSARILY LINENUM1).
                '$' MEANS 'LINE-AFTER-LINENUM1'.
  'COPIES'    - THE NUMBER OF COPIES OF THE LINE TO BE MADE.
                TO SPECIFY COPIES, YOU MUST ALSO SPECIFY BOTH OF THE
                FIRST TWO OPERANDS.
  'INCREMENT' - IF MORE THAN 1 COPY, THE INCREMENT TO USE ON
                THE LINE NUMBERS AFTER THE FIRST.
))INSERT      - NEW LINES ARE NOT TO REPLACE ANY EXISTING LINES.
))REPLACE     - NEW LINES ARE TO REPLACE EXISTING LINES IF THEIR
                SEQUENCE NUMBERS COINCIDE (EXCEPT FIRST NEW LINE).
