)F FUNCTION -
   THE PRINTOFF COMMAND CAN BE USED TO OBTAIN HARDCOPY
   OF DATA SETS THROUGH FOREGROUND COPYING TO SYSOUT.
   THE COMMAND PRINTS A DATASET(S) WHICH IS SEQUENTIAL
   OR PARTITIONED, BLOCKED OR UNBLOCKED, WITH FIXED OR
   VARIABLE RECORD LENGTH LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO 256
   (255 IF WITHOUT CARRIAGE CONTROL).

)O OPERANDS -
))'DSLIST'  - 'DATA SET LIST' CONTAINS THE NAMES OF DATA SETS
            TO BE PRINTED OR PUNCHED.  THE NAMES SHOULD FOLLOW
            TSO CONVENTION,  IN QUOTES IF THE PRIMARY INDEX
            DIFFERS FROM YOUR USERID, OR WITHOUT QUOTES AND
            WITH THE PRIMARY INDEX OMITTED IF IT IS THE SAME
            AS YOUR USERID.
))CLASS('CLASS') - SYSOUT CLASS IN WHICH OUTPUT IS TO BE
            PRINTED.  DEFAULT IS A.
))COPIES('NNN') - NUMBER OF COPIES TO BE PRINTED.
            DEFAULT IS 1.
))DEST('REMOTE') - REMOTE LOCATION TO WHICH SYSOUT DATA SETS
            ARE TO BE ROUTED.
))HOLD      - OUTPUT IS TO BE PLACED ON A HOLD QUEUE UPON
            DEALLOCATION.
))NOHOLD    - OUTPUT IS NOT TO BE PLACED ON A HOLD QUEUE
            UPON DEALLOCATION.
))LIST      - MEMBER NAMES ARE ONLY TO BE LISTED UNLESS
            PRINT IS EXPLICITLY STATED.
))NOLIST    - MEMBER NAMES ARE NOT TO BE LISTED (ONLY
            PRINTED UNLESS NOPRINT IS EXPLICITLY STATED).
))PRINT     - MEMBERS ARE ONLY TO BE PRINTED (NOT LISTED
            UNLESS LIST IS EXPLICITLY STATED).
))NOPRINT   - MEMBERS ARE NOT TO BE PRINTED (ONLY LISTED
            UNLESS NOLIST IS EXPLICITLY STATED).
))FORMS('FORM')  - FORM TO BE USED WHEN THE DATA SET IS PRINTED.
                  (1-4 CHARACTER FORM NAME)
))UCS('IMAGE')   - PRINT IMAGE TO BE USED WHEN PRINTED.
            THIS IS OFTEN CALLED THE TRAIN.
            (1-4 CHARACTER PRINT IMAGE NAME)
))PROG('NAME')  - PROGRAM TO BE USED TO PRINT THE DATASET.
                 SEE JCL MANUAL FOR MORE DETAIL.
))FCB('FCBNAME') - CARRIAGE CONTROL IMAGE TO BE USED.
            (1-4 CHARACTER CONTROL IMAGE NAME)
))HEADING   - OUTPUT IS TO HAVE HEADING INFORMATION.
            THIS CONTAINS THE DATASET NAME.
))NOHEADING - OUTPUT IS NOT HAVE HEADING INFORMATION.
))SNUM      - THE LAST 8 COLUMNS OF FIXED-LENGTH RECORDS
            AND THE FIRST 8 COLUMNS OF VARIABLE LENGTH RECORDS
            WILL NOT BE PRINTED. THIS ALLOWS SEQUENCE NUMBERS
            TO BE SUPPRESSED FROM THE PRINT.
))ASA       - USE THIS KEYWORD IF YOUR DATA SET CONTAINS ASA
            CARRIAGE CONTROLS IN COLUMN 1 BUT ITS RECORD FORMAT
            DOES NOT INDICATE SO, AND YOU WANT PRINTOFF TO USE
            THE CARRIAGE CONTROLS IN THE DATA.
))CAPS      - OUTPUT IS TO BE CONVERTED TO UPPER CASE
            PRIOR TO PRINTING.
))ASIS      - OUTPUT IS NOT TO BE CONVERTED TO UPPER CASE
            PRIOR TO PRINTING.(IT IS LEFT AS IT IS)
))TEXT      - OUTPUT IS CONSIDERED TO BE TEXT. THIS OPERAND CHANGES
            CHANGES DEFAULTS TO BE ASIS UCS(TN)'
))VOLUME('VOLSER') - VOLUME SERIAL OF VOLUME ON WHICH DATA SETS
            TO BE PRINTED ARE FOUND.  THIS VOLUME SERIAL
            WILL BE USED FOR ALL DATA SETS SPECIFIED IN
            THE DATA SET LIST.
))NOMSG     - MESSAGES TO THE TERMINAL ARE TO BE SUPPRESSED.
