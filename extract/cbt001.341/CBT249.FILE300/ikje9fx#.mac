)F FUNCTION -
  FINDX SEARCHES FOR A SPECIFIED HEX STRING BEGINNING WITH THE
  CURRENT LINE, PROVIDED OPERANDS ARE SPECIFIED (SEE SYNTAX). THE
  CURRENT LINE POINTER * IS MOVED TO THE FIRST LINE FOUND TO CONTAIN
  THE STRING. THE SEARCH IS MADE AT A SPECIFIED OFFSET OR AT EVERY
  POSITION WITHIN EACH LINE.
)X SYNTAX -
         FINDX  '=CHAR-STRING='   'POSITION'
  REQUIRED - NONE
  DEFAULTS - IF NO OPERANDS ARE SPECIFIED, THOSE SPECIFIED ON THE LAST
             PREVIOUS ISSUE OF THE FIND OR FINDX SUBCOMMAND ARE ASSUMED.
             THE SEARCH BEGINS AT THE LINE FOLLOWING THE CURRENT LINE.
  ALIAS    - FX
)O OPERANDS -
  '=CHAR-STRING='
           - THE DELIMITER (REPRESENTED BY =) CAN BE CHOSEN TO BE ANY
             NON-NUMERIC CHARACTER, EXCEPT BLANK, COMMA, TAB, ASTERISK,
             PARENTHESIS, APOSTROPHE, OR SEMICOLON, WHICH DOES NOT
             APPEAR WITHIN THE SPECIFIED CHARACTER STRING. THE SECOND
             OCCURRENCE OF THE DELIMITER CAN BE REPLACED BY CARRIAGE
             RETURN IF 'POSITION' IS NOT SPECIFIED.
             THE CHARACTER STRING MUST HAVE AN EVEN NUMBER OF HEX
             CHARACTERS (0 THRU 9, A THRU F), EACH PAIR REPRESENTING
             ONE BYTE.
  'POSITION' -
             SPECIFIES THE COLUMN WITHIN EACH LINE AT WHICH THE
             COMPARISON IS TO BE MADE. VALID ONLY IF CHARACTER
             STRING IS SPECIFIED ALSO. IF CHARACTER STRING IS
             SPECIFIED AND THIS OPERAND IS OMITTED, THE COMPARISON
             IS MADE AT EVERY COLUMN WITHIN EACH LINE.
