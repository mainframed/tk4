            ---------------------------------------------------------

             THIS IS A COLLECTION OF TSO CP'S FROM MANY SOURCES.IT IS
            MY INTENT TO PUT TOGETHER A FILE OF TSO CP'S FOR SHARE. SOME
            SOME ARE ORIGINAL AND MOST WERE OBTAINED FROM MY OS/MVT DAYS
            AND CONVERTED. IT'S EMBARRASSING TO TELL MANAGEMENT THAT
            USERS HAVE LOST FUNCTIONS MIGRATING TO MVS. HOPEFULLY I CAN
            BECOME A FOCAL POINT FOR TSO CP'S. ALSO I HAVE ISPF/PDF AND
            BUT AM REQUIRED TO SUPPORT 300-1200 BAUD ASYNC TERMINALS.
            THUS TO KEEP THOSE PEOPLE HAPPY AND RELATIVELY PRODUCTIVE I
            MUST BE CONCERNED WITH THINGS OUTSIDE OF THE WONDEROUS SPF.
            I WILL BE ADDING MORE TO THIS FILE AS TIME PROGRESSES.

                     D I S C L A I M E R     !!!!!
                 *************************************
               USE ALL OF THESE AT YOUR OWN RISK, NATURALLY!
                 *************************************

           THE FILE IS CONSTRUCTED OF MEMBERS AS FOLLOWS: THE SOURCE IS
           PUT IN AS A NAME, THEN THE HELP IS SUFFIXED WITH A #
           SIGN, AND THE THE JCL TO INSTALL IS SUFFIXED WITH A $ SIGN.

           FOR EXAMPLE:   CMD     - SOURCE MEMBER
                          CMD#    - HELP ENTRY
                          CMD$    - JCL TO INSTALL

            NOTE:
            MANY OF THESE MODULES HAVE THE CSECT STACKED TOGETHER, LOOK
            AT THE JCL INSTALL MEMBER TO SEE IF THERE A 'PARM=BATCH' IN
            COMPILE. IF YOU ONLY HAVE ASMF THEN YOU MAY HAVE TO BREAK
            THE CODE APART SINCE ASMF DOES NOT SUPPORT BATCH COMPILES !

            NOTE:
            MANY OF THESE WILL RUN AS IS UNDER MVT, SOME HAVE A
            COMPILE CODE THAT LETS YOU SET IT FOR MVS OR MVT. NEAT!

            NOTE:
            IF YOU INSTALL A COMD WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE CODE, AND IF
            TRY TO USE IT, IT MAY COME BACK WITH ' COMMAND NOT FOUND '.
            IT IS PROBABLY BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME CHECKING FOR SECURITY
            THAT LOOKS AT THE TSOID. THEREFORE IF IT ISN'T A MATCH WE
            XCTL TO THE SAME MODULE THAT WILL YIELD 'COMMAND NOT FOUND'
            CONFUSES THE HECK OUT OF PEOPLE WHO OVERHEAR A WORD AND ARE
            SLICK ENOUGH TO COPY THE CMD ELSEWHERE !!!!!

            NOTE:
            THE JCL YOU MAY SEE IN THE INSTALLATION OF THE TSO CP'S
            MAY LOOK STRANGE. ALL IT IS BASICALLY THE COMPILE AND
            LKED STEPS (ASMFCL OR ASMHCL). IT MAY LOOK A BIT DIFFERENT
            BUT IT IS REALLY NOT. WE HAVE AN IBM 3800 AND ROTATE THE
            PRINT. THAT IS WHY THE PROC IS DIFFERENT FROM THE STANDARD.
            THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE JCL IS TO SEE WHAT MEMBERS
            ARE INPUTTED AND THE LKED EDIT ATTRIBUTES OF THE MODULE.

            NOTE:
            IF YOU INSTALL THE TSO SUBCOMMANDS OF EDIT, YOU
            SHOULD READ THE TSO SPL. WE CALLED OUR MODULES IKJXXXXX
            NOT TO MEAN THESE ARE IBM MODULES BUT TO IDENTITY THEM TO
            US AS TSO CP'S OF EDIT. ALSO REMEMBER YOU HAVE TO UPDATE
            'IKJEBMA9' EDIT SUBCOMMAND TABLE. READ THE SPL ON IT. IT IS
            CONFUSING BECAUSE A SUBCMD CAN HAVE MANY NAMES AND DO NOT
            HAVE TO MATCH THE MEMBER NAME IN THE LOAD MODULE LIBRARY.
            DO NOT PANIC IF IT LOOKS LIKE MAGIC, JUST GO TO THE SPL.

            MUST GIVE A SPECIAL NOTE OF THANKS TO MR. BILL GODFREY FROM
            PLANNING RESEARCH CORPORATION (PRC). HE IS A CONTRACTOR
            ASSIGNED TO US AND HE IS A TSO WIZARD. HE HAS WRITTEN A LOT
            OF THE TSO COMMANDS AND IMPROVED UPON OTHERS.

            NOTE:
            CONVERTED THE $$PROSE MEMBER INTO INFOSYS FORMAT.

            CHANGE ACTIVITY LOG :
                           THE PREVIOUS $$PROSE IS STORED IN THE FILE AS
                           $$PROSEO. SO YOU CAN GET AN IDEA OF WHAT HAS
                           BEEN ADDED OR CHANGED. $$PROSEX IS 2 BACK.

                           NOW UP ON MVS/SP 1.1     5 JAN 82
                           WILL ATTEMPT TO FIX ALL THE CP'S
                           THAT DO NOT WORK, MOST ARE UNAFFECTED.

             -----------------------------------------------------

          $$NOTE   -  HAVE GONE BACK TO ALL MODULES IN THIS FILE AND AM
                      AM MAKING SURE ALL THE PIECES ARE HERE. SUBRNTS,
                      MACROS, ETC.  FOUND SOME ERROR WHEN SOME PEOPLE
                      CALLED AND TOLD ME SOME THINGS WERE MISSING.

                 ADDED SOME NOTES IN THE SECTIONS ABOVE, PLSE READ FOR
                 THERE HAS BEEN SOME CALLS WITH QUESTIONS.

          20 MAY 82 - MAJOR CHANGE, HOW I PACKAGE THE FILES. THE MACROS
                      FOR THIS FILE ARE NOW IN THIS FILE. THE MACRO HAS
                      DISAPPEARED.

           5 SEP 82 - I HAVE BEEN INSTALLING ALOT OF MY GOODIES THAT I
                      BROUGHT FROM THE PENTAGON AND THEREFORE I AM
                      ADDING ALOT OF JCL BECAUSE I AM INSTALLING
                      YOU PEOPLE HAVE TO DO TO INSTALL. YOU MAY NOTE I
                      HAVE BEEN ADDING ALIGN TO THE ASMH PARMS. THIS IS
                      BECAUSE THE ASMH COMPILER WAS GENERATED WITH
                      NOALIGN.

                          TO TO IT AFTER SETTING THE JSCBAUTH BIT ON.
                          WHEN THE COMMAND COMPLETES THE JSCBAUTH
                          BIT WILL BE SET OFF. THE JSCB TAMPERING IS
                          DONE IN A USER SVC(YOUR OWN). YOU MUST
                          REPLACE THE USERSVC MACRO WITH YOUR OWN

                          A.  HAVE BEEN DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATED.
                          B.  ARE NOT CURRENTLY IN USE.

          FORTP     1  -  DO FORTRAN G1 COMPILES INTERACTIVELY.
                          LOOK AT THE JCL INSTALL, IT IS SLICK AND NOT
                          JUST A SIMPLE COMPILE, LINKEDIT. IT IS NOT
                          COMPLICATED, BUT YOU USE THE SAME SOURCE CODE
