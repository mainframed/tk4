        I HAVE PUNCHED THE RESUMEE PSW AND AM SETTLED IN MY NEW JOB
  AT THE SAN ANTONIO DATA SERVICES CENTER.


  -------------------------------------------------------------------


     THIS IS A COLLECTION OF TSO CP'S FROM MANY SOURCES. MY INTENT IS
  TO PUT TOGETHER A FILE TO THESE CP'S FOR SHARE'S USE. SOME ARE ORIG-
  INAL AND MOST WERE OBTAINED FROM OUR  OS/MVT  DAYS AND CONVERTED.
  IT IS EMBARASSING TO TELL MANAGEMENT THAT USERS HAVE LOST FUNCTIONS
  MIGRATING TO MVS AND ALL ITS WONDERS. HOPEFULLY I CAN BECOME
  A FOCAL POINT FOR TSO COMMAND PROCESSORS. I HAVE AN IBM
  3850 MSS BOX TO KEEP LOTS OF GOODIES ONLINE. ALSO I HAVE
  SPF BUT AM REQUIRED TO SUPPORT 300-1200 BAUD ASYNC TERMINALS.
  THUS TO KEEP THOSE PEOPLE HAPPY AND RELATIVELY PRODUCTIVE I
  MUST BE CONCERNED WITH THINGS OUTSIDE OF THE WONDEROUS 'SPF'.
  I WILL BE ADDING MORE TO THIS FILE AS TIME PROGRESSES.

     IT IS MY INTENT TO GET ALL THE TSO CP'S OFF THE CBT TAPE AND
  INCORPORATE THEM INTO THIS FILE. IF YOU FIND ANY BUGS IN THESE
  COMMANDS, PLEASE SEND ME THE CORRECTIONS.


             D I S C L A I M E R S  !!!!!
          *************************************
           USE ALL OF THESE AT YOUR OWN RISK, NATURALLY!
          *************************************


     THE FILE IS CONSTRUCTED OF MEMBERS AS FOLLOWS: THE SOURCE IS
  PUT IN AS A NAME, THEN THE HELP IS SUFFIXED WITH A # SIGN, AND THE
  THE JCL TO INSTALL IS SUFFIXED WITH A $ SIGN.

  FOR EXAMPLE:   CMD     - SOURCE MEMBER
                 CMD#    - HELP ENTRY
                 CMD$    - JCL TO INSTALL


   NOTE: THERE IS A FILE A MACROS WHICH IS REQUIRED FOR SOME OF THESE,
         BUT NOT ALL.

   NOTE: MANY OF THESE MODULES HAVE THE CSECT STACKED TOGETHER, SO LOOK
         AT THE JCL INSTALL MEMBER TO SEE IF THERE A 'PARM=BATCH' IN
         COMPILE. IF YOU ONLY HAVE ASMF THEN YOU MAY HAVE TO BREAK
         THE CODE APART SINCE ASMF DOES NOT SUPPORT BATCH COMPILES !

   NOTE: MANY OF THESE WILL RUN AS IS UNDER MVT, SOME HAVE A COMPILED
         CODE THAT LETS YOU SET IT FOR MVS OR MVT. NEAT !!!!!

   NOTE: IF ANYONE GET A RELEASE LEVEL OF NOT AN INTEGER ( LIKE 2.3 OR
         7.6 ) THEN YOU KNOW YOU HAVE AN IN BETWEEN COPY OF THE TAPE.
         I WILL ALWAYS DISTRIBUTE AN EVEN NUMBER RELEASE TO THE
         MVS MODS PEOPLE ( LIKE  4.0 OR 7.0 ).

   NOTE: IF YOU INSTALL A COMMAND WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE CODE, AND IF
         TRY TO USE IT, IT MAY COME BACK WITH ' COMMAND NOT FOUND '. IT
         IS PROBABLY BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME CHECKING FOR SECURITY PURPOSES
         THAT LOOKS AT THE TSOID. THEREFORE IF IT ISN'T A MATCH WE
         XCTL TO THE SAME MODULE THAT WILL YIELD ' COMMAND NOT FOUND '
         CONFUSES THE HECK OUT OF PEOPLE WHO OVERHEAR A WORD AND ARE
         SLICK ENOUGH TO COPY THE CMD ELSEWHERE !!!!!

   5 NOV 81 NOTE:  THE JCL YOU MAY SEE IN THE INSTALLATION OF THE
         TSO CP'S MAY LOOK STRANGE. ALL IT IS BASICALLY THE COMPILE
         AND LKED STEPS (ASMFCL OR ASMHCL). IT MAY LOOK A BIT DIFFERENT
         BUT IT IS REALLY NOT. WE HAVE AN IBM 3800 AND ROTATE THE
         PRINT. THAT IS WHY THE PROC IS DIFFERENT FROM THE STANDARD.
         THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE JCL IS TO SEE WHAT MEMBERS
         ARE INPUTTED AND THE LKED EDIT ATTRIBUTES OF THE MODULE.

   5 NOV 81 NOTE: IF YOU INSTALL THE TSO SUBCOMMANDS OF EDIT, YOU
         SHOULD READ THE TSO SPL. WE CALLED OUR MODULES IKJXXXXX
         NOT TO MEAN THESE ARE IBM MODULES BUT TO IDENTITY THEM TO
         US AS TSO CP'S OF EDIT. ALSO REMEMBER YOU HAVE TO UPDATE
         'IKJEBMA9' EDIT SUBCOMMAND TABLE. READ THE SPL ON IT. IT IS
         CONFUSING BECAUSE A SUBCMD CAN HAVE MANY NAMES AND THEY DO
         NOT HAVE TO MATCH THE MEMBER NAME IN THE LOAD MODULE LIBRARY.
         DO NOT PANIC IF IT LOOKS LIKE MAGIC, JUST GO TO THE SPL.

  11 JUL 82 NOTE: ADDED TO THE RELEASE LEVEL OF A MODULE (T) FOR THE
         MODULE BEING IN TEST MODE. WITH MY MOVE TO SAN ANTONIO AND
         THE FACT MY GENIUS 'BILL GODFREY' HAS LEFT ME, THE AIR FORCE
         DATA SERVICES CENTER HAS TERMINATED HIS CONTRACT, I NO
         LONGER HAVE THE EXPERTISE OF BILL TO DO ALL MY WISHES. THUS
         IF YOU WANT TO GET SOMETHING TO WORK, HAVE AT IT. I ONLY
         GET TO WORK ON THESE THINGS IN MY SPARE TIME AND WILL TRY
         TO GET EVERYTHING TO WORK. SO (T) MEANS IT IS IN TEST AND
         I WILL TRY TO GET IT TO WORK.  AGAIN A THANKS TO BILL!!!!!



   I MUST GIVE A SPECIAL NOTE OF THANKS TO MR. BILL GODFREY FROM
   PLANNING RESEARCH CORPORATION (PRC). HE IS A CONTRACTOR ASSIGNED
   TO US AND HE IS A TSO WIZARD. HE HAS WRITTEN A LOT OF THE TSO
   COMMANDS AND IMPROVED UPON OTHERS.



    CHANGE ACTIVITY LOG :  THE PREVIOUS $$PROSE IS STORED IN THE FILE AS
                           $$PROSEO. SO YOU CAN GET AN IDEA OF WHAT HAS
                           BEEN ADDED OR CHANGED. $$PROSEX IS 2 BACK.

                           NOW UP ON MVS/SP 1.1     5 JAN 82
                           WILL ATTEMPT TO FIX ALL THE CP'S
                           THAT DO NOT WORK, MOST ARE UNAFFECTED.

    --------------------------------------------------------------

    $$NOTE   -  HAVE GONE BACK TO ALL MODULES IN THIS FILE AND AM
                MAKING SURE ALL THE PIECES ARE HERE. SUBROUTINES,
                MACROS, ETC.  FOUND SOME ERROR WHEN SOME PEOPLE
                CALLED AND TOLD ME SOME THINGS WERE MISSING.

    CATLG    -  ADDED. THIS HAS PROBLEMS THAT I WILL RESOLVE ASAP.
    DELAY    -  ADDED.
    IKJE9SS  -  APPLIED IBM APAR TO THE SOURCE CODE FOR IBM 3380
                (SHOULD BE GOOD FOR 3375'S)
    IO       -  ADDED. THIS HAS NOT BEEN TESTED !!!!!!
    PLIF     -  ADDED. HAS SOME COMPILE ERRORS, WILL FIX ASAP.
    PRINTOFF -  CORRECTED IBM DESIGN ERROR OF ONLY ALLOWING 7 CHAR
                DESTINATION CODES. CHANGED TO 8.
    QCB      -  ADDED.
    RENAMEV  -  ADDED & CHANGED SOME MACROS TO INLINE CODE.
    SCRATCH  -  ADDED. THIS HAS NOT BEEN TESTED !!!!!
    SHOWSPC  -  ADDED.
    SHOWSS   -  ADDED.
    SOLICIT  -  ADDED HELP ENTRY FOR THIS COMMAND.
    SPZAP    -  ADDED.
    SUBMITX  -  ADDED. SUBMIT WORK FROM TSO TO A SECONDARY JES2 !!!!!
                INCLUDES ALIASES OF STATUSX, OUTPUTX, AND CANCELX.
                NO NEED TO TELL YOU WHAT THOSE ARE FOR !!!!!!!!!!
                NOTED SOME QUESTION IF IT WORKS IN JES2/SP1.3.
                BILL GODFREY SUGGESTS THAT SOME MACROS HARD CODED
                IN THE SOURCE BE REMOVED. NOT ON SP1.3 SO I CAN NOT
                TEST IT.   TRY IT AND SEE IF IT IS TRUE.
    UNCATLG  -  ADDED. THIS HAS PROBLEMS THAT WILL RESOLVE ASAP.
    VTOC     -  ADDED.

    --------------------------------------------------------------

    ADDED SOME NOTES IN THE SECTIONS ABOVE, PLSE READ FOR THERE HAS
          BEEN SOME CALLS WITH QUESTIONS.

    20 MAY 82 - MAJOR CHANGE IN HOW I PACKAGE THE FILES. THE MACROS
                FOR THIS FILE ARE NOW IN THIS FILE. THE MACRO FILE
                WILL DISAPPEAR.

    18 JUN 82 - (T) IN THE RELEASE LEVEL INDICATES THE CP IS IN TEST
                AND MAY NOT FUNCTION. I PUT IT ONTO THE TAPE ONLY IN
                CASE YOU MAY NEED IT AND DO THE TEST AND DEBUG YOUR-
                SELF. I WILL WORK ON THE BUG AS SOON AS I GET TIME.
                GOOD LUCK !!!!!!!!!

     5 SEP 82 - I HAVE BEEN INSTALLING ALOT OF MY GOODIES THAT I
                BROUGHT FROM THE PENTAGON AND THEREFORE I AM ADDING
                ALOT OF JCL BECAUSE I AM GOING THE THROWS OF WHAT
                YOU PEOPLE HAVE TO DO TO INSTALL. YOU MAY NOTE I
                HAVE BEEN ADDING ALIGN TO THE ASMH PARMS. THIS IS
                BECAUSE THE ASMH COMPILER WAS GENERATED WITH
                NOALIGN.

    --------------------------------------------------------------

   SUMMARY OF THE MODULES CONTAINED.

   CP    REL           DESCRIPTION


$DI       3  -  OPERATOR LIKE $DI COMMAND.

ABEND#    2  -  NOT A COMMAND BUT A HELP ENTRY FOR ABEND CODES AND
                SOME OF THE COMMON REASONS YOU MAY GET THEM.
                UPDATED FOR MVS.

ASK       1  -  CLIST USE COMMAND TO ASK A QUESTION AND GET A YES OR
                NO BACK THUS SETTING A RETURN CODE. (WAS AROUND IN
                MVT DAYS AND IS OBSOLETE WITH MVS CLIST LANGUAGE)

ASMG      1  -  DO ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE COMPILES INTERACTIVE. THIS IS FOR
                ASSEMBLER G AND IS SIMILIAR TO THE ONE IN THIS FILE FOR
                ASSEMBLER H. BOTH SHOULD WORK FOR OS/MVT AND MVS.

ASMH      4  -  DO ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE COMPILES INTERATIVE. YOU CAN
                GET THE IBM PRODUCT WHICH IS SUPERIOR, BUT THIS IS
                FREE. WE HAVE A 'SYS2.MACLIB' DEFINED IN THIS ONE
                FOR USERS GENERALLY HAVING A USER MACLIB.

ASMHNOX   1  -  ZAP TO THE IBM P.P. ASSEMBLER H TO FIX A THE BUG
                SAYING 'NOXREF' YOU GET 'XREF(FULL)'. PTF LEVEL-21
                MADE XREF DEFAULT TO XREF(FULL) AND INTRODUCED THE
                DESCRIBED ABOVE. NOTE: ASSEMBLER H IS CLASS C.

ASMF      2  -  DO ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE COMPILES INTERATIVE. YOU CAN
                GET THE IBM PRODUCT WHICH IS SUPERIOR, BUT THIS IS
                FREE. WE HAVE A 'SYS2.MACLIB' DEFINED IN THIS ONE
                FOR USERS GENERALLY HAVING A USER MACLIB. THIS ONE
                UTILITIZES THE ASMXF ( IFOX00 ) COMPILER. SHOULD
                NOTE THAT THE SOURCE FOR THIS IS THE ASMH PROMPTER
                WITH SOME SYSPARMS CHANGED. NEAT !!!!!!!

CALC      1  -  TSO CALCULATOR PROGRAM. HAS 1 ACCUMULATOR AND 9 REG-
                ISTERS, ALSO CAN DO FUNCTIONS LIKE SIN, COS, ETC OR
                DEFINE YOUR OWN.  ( PLI-OPT )

CATLG    (T) -  DO CATLG FUNCTIONS.

COBOLCHK  2  -  AFDSC DEVELOPED CHEAP COBOL PROMPTER. DOES COBOL
                COMPILES (COBOLVS) INSIDE TSO, ONLY GIVING THE ERRORS
                AT THE TERMINAL. USES 'SYNTAX' OPTION OF COMPILER AND
                IS GREAT FOR ASYNCH SLOW SPEED TERMINALS.

CDSCB     3  -  ZAP FORMAT-1 DSCB OF DATASETS ON THE FLY. USEFUL FOR
                SYSTEM TYPES !!!!

COMPARE   3  -  COMPARE 2 FILES IN THE FOREGROUND. BASED ON THE YALE
                UNIVERSITY COMPARE PROGRAM. OPTIONALLY YOU CAN ASK FOR
                IBM'S  IEBCOMPR UTILITY PROGRAM INSTEAD. MODIFIED
                YALE'S PROGRAM AND CALLED IT COMPAREB.

COMPRESS  2  -  COMPRESS A PDS IN FOREGROUND.

CONCAT    1  -  CONCAT 2 TO 9 FILES TOGETHER. TRUE MVS ALLOCATE CMD CAN
                DO IT, BUT WE RUN PROGRAM CONTROL FACILITY (PCF).
                THUS  IF A CUSTOMER FREES A FILE THAT IS SYS1
                THEN THEY CAN NOT ALLOCATE IT BACK.

COPYPDS   3  -  COPIES A PDS TO ANOTHER PDS. ALSO ALLOWS YOU TO COPY
                MEMBERS WITH A SELECT STATEMENT. UNLIKE THE TSO COMMAND
                UTILITY 'COPY' YOU CAN COPY MEMBERS THAT CAN INCLUDE THE
                ALIAS FOR THE MEMBER.

COPYSDS   1  -  COPY ONE SEQUENTIAL DATASET TO ANOTHER SEQUENTIAL
                DATASET.

COUNT     1  -  COUNT THE NUMBER OF RECORDS IN A FILE.

CPSCB     1  -  CHANGE YOUR PROTECTED STEP CONTROL BLOCK (PSCB) ON THE
                FLY TO GIVE YOURSELF THINGS LIKE MOUNT AUTHORITY, ETC.
                SHOULD PROBABLY RESTRICT THIS TO SYSTEMS ONLY.

DA        3  -  DISPLAY ACTIVE COMMAND TO GIVE THE USERS PICTURE OF
                THE SYSTEM IS DOING. THEY LIKE TO SEE HOW MUCH TIME
                THE JOB HAS !!!!

DATE      1  -  GIVES THE DATE AND TIME FROM THE SYSTEM.

DD        4  -  SHORT FORM OF ALLOCATE FOR AN EXISTING FILE. IT IS
                FASTER THAN ALLOCATE. UPDATED TO LET YOU
                ALLOCATE A NEW FILE ALSO.

DECONCAT  1  -  REVERSE OF THE CONCAT COMMAND.

DELAY     1  -  SPECIFY A NUMBER OF SECONDS AND HAVE YOU WAIT THAT
                LONG.

DEX       1  -  TSO HEXIDECMAL CALCULATOR PROGRAM.

DISPLAY   1  -  SHOWS CONTROL BLOCKS LIKE THE UCB ETC.

DOPROG    1  -  GIVES THE USER THE 'CALL' COMMAND FUNCTION BY ATTACHING
                A PROGRAM.

DUDASD    1  -  OPERATOR LIKE  D U,DASD  COMMAND.

DUSER     1  -  SHOW THE USERIDS CURRENTLY LOGGED ON TSO.

EDAIR30   1  -  SUBPROGRAM. AN ENHANCED VERSION OF IKJDAIR FOR
                ALLOCATING A SYSOUT DATASET.

ERROR#    2  -  NOT A COMMAND BUT A HELP ENTRY FOR RETURN CODES THAT
                YOU CAN GET FROM DAIR ALLOCATION. UPDATED FOR MVS.

FREEALL   3  -  MVS VERSION OF THE FAMOUS 'FREEALL' COMMAND TO
                FREE DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATED DATASETS. AFDSC MODIFIED
                TO FREE ALL DATASETS WHICH:
                          A.  HAVE BEEN DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATED.
                          B.  ARE NOT CURRENTLY IN USE.
                          C.  ARE NOT CURRENTLY OPEN.
                          D.  ARE NOT ALLOCATED TO DDNAME=SYSPROC.

FINDFILE  1  -  DISPLAYS WHERE A DATASET IS CATALOGUED AND LISTS
                ALL MOUNTED DIRECT ACCESS VOLUMES ON WHICH THE
                DATASET RESIDES. NOTE: FOUND ON THE CBT TAPE AS
                'LOCDSN', TO ME 'FINDFILE' IS MORE DESCRIPTIVE.

FORTP     1  -  DO FORTRAN G1 COMPILES INTERACTIVELY.
                LOOK AT THE JCL INSTALL, IT IS SLICK AND NOT
                JUST A SIMPLE COMPILE, LINKEDIT. IT IS NOT
                COMPLICATED, BUT YOU USE THE SAME SOURCE CODE
                WITH SYSPARM OPTIONS TO COMPILE 2 MODULES.

FORTX     1  -  DO FORTRAN X (EXTENDED) COMPILES INTERACTIVELY.
                THERE IS A FORTRAN PRODUCT SUPERIOR BUT THIS IS FREE.

IKJEBMA9  3  -  EXAMPLE OF THE MVS EDIT SUB-COMMAND TABLE AND WHAT
                YOU CAN MAKE VALID SUB-COMMANDS. HAS ALL THE AFDSC
                SUB-COMMANDS OF EDIT IN THE TABLE.

IKJEFF10  1  -  AFDSC IPO BASED TSO SUBMIT EXIT. THIS IS RELATIVELY
                SIMPLE. FORCES THE FOLLOWING RESTRICTION ON A TSOUSER
                  1. JOBNAME ON SUBMITTED JOB CARD MUST BE USERID
                     PLUS ONE CHARACTER.
                  2. PROGRAMMER NAME FIELD (8 OR LESS CHARACTER) IN
                     UADS MUST MATCH PROGRAMMER NAME (8 OR LESS IN
                     JOB CARD).

IKJEFF53  1  -  AFDSC IPO BASED TSO 'STATUS/OUTPUT/CANCEL' EXIT. THERE
                IS ALOT OF POSSIBILITIES IN THIS CODE.

IKJE9CT   1  -  'COUNT'. AFDSC DEVELOPED SUBCMD OF EDIT TO GIVE THE
                NUMBER OF RECORDS YOU ARE CURRENTLY EDITING.

IKJE9CX   1  -  'CHANGEX'  AFDSC DEVELOPED SUBCOMMAND OF EDIT. PERFORMS
                THE SAME FUNCTION AS CHANGE BUT USES HEXADECIMAL
                STRINGS.

IKJE9DU   1  -  'DUP'  AFDSC DEVELOPED SUBCOMMAND OF EDIT. PERFORMS
                A SIMILIAR FUNCTION AS SPF REPEAT FUNCTION BUT ONLY
                ON 1 LINE. CAN REPEAT AN EXISTING LINE OR MAKE A COPY
                OF AN EXISTING LINE ELSEWHERE AND REPEAT IT.

IKJE9FX   1  -  'FINDX'. AFDSC DEVELOPED SUBCOMMAND OF EDIT TO DO
                A FIND BUT BE ABLE TO SPECIFY A HEX CHARACTER STRING.

IKJE9OF   1  -  'OFFLINE'. AFDSC SUBCOMMAND OF EDIT TO 'SPINOFF'
                TO PRINT THE FILE YOU ARE CURRENTLY EDITING. ( ARE
                NOT REQUIRED TO SAVE FIRST ). CAN 'DEST' TO REMOTES,
                ETC. SEE THE HELP FOR SPECIFICS

IKJE9LT   1  -  'LISTTABS'. FOUND BY AFDSC. BACK FROM MVT DAYS AND
                CONVERTED BY BOB HANSEN (SEC) TO RUN IN MVS. LISTS
                YOUR CURRENT EDIT TABS FOR YOU.

IKJE9LX   1  -  'LISTX'. AFDSC DEVELOPED SUBCMD OF EDIT TO DISPLAY TO
                YOUR TERMINAL,  LINES OF A DATASET BEING EDIT'ED IN
                HEXADECIMAL FORMAT.

IKJE9NA   1  -  'NAME'. AFDSC DEVELOPED SUBCMD OF EDIT TO TELL THE
                NAME OF THE FILE OR MEMBER OF A PDS YOU ARE CURRENTLY
                EDITTING. IT'S EMBARASSING IF YOU FORGET.

IKJE9PT   1  -  'PUT'. AFDSC DEVELOPED SUBCMD OF EDIT TO PUT CHAR-
                ACTER STRINGS IN CERTAIN COLUMNS. NICE FOR USERS OF
                ASYNC TERMINALS WHO DO NOT HAVE SPF.

IKJE9SP   1  -  'SPOT'. AFDSC DEVELOPED SUBCMD OF EDIT TO SPOT CHAR-
                ACTER STRINGS IN DATA. AGAIN NICE FOR ASYNC TERMINALS
                WHO DO NOT HAVE SPF. ALSO CONTAINS A SELECT AND
                EXCLUDE FUNCTION  FOR DELETION OF RECORDS THAT FIT A
                PATTERN. SEE THE HELP ENTRY FOR MORE DETAILS.

IKJE9SS   2  -  'SAVESHR'. AFDSC DEVELOPED SUBCMD OF EDIT TO ALLOW
                A SAVE WITH A  DISP=SHR. EDIT HAS THE NASTY HABIT
                OF TRYING TO GET A DISP=OLD WHEN YOU SAVE; THUS IF
                YOU NEED TO SAVE SOMETHING INTO A FILE THAT IS ALLOC-
                ATED ALL THE TIME,  TOUGH !!!!!   APAR AZ57430 APPLIED

INSTREAM  1  -  AFDSC DEVELOPED COMMAND TO BE USED IN CLIST TO CONTROL
                CARDS INSIDE OF CLISTS. CAN ALSO BE USER INPUT FROM THE
                TERMINAL.  VERY NICE.

IO       (T) -  LIST THE IO COUNTS FOR EACH FILE IN YOUR TSO SESSION.

JULIAN    1  -  RETRIEVE THE DATE AND GREGORIAN DAY FROM  THE SYSTEM.
                ALSO CAN RETURN THE SAME INFO FOR ANY YEAR AND DAY.

KOMM      1  -  USED IN CLISTS FOR FORMATTING DISPLAYS IN FULL SCREEN
                SUPPORT ON 3270 TYPE TERMINALS.

LASTCC#   1  -  NOT A TSO COMMAND, BUT A HELP ENTRY OF LIST OF ERROR
                CODES THAT CAN OCCUR IN A COMMAND PROCEDURE (CLIST).
