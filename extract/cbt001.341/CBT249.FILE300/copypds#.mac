  THE 'IEBCOPY' UTILITY IS INVOKED.  THE 'SYSPRINT' MESSAGES
  FROM IEBCOPY ARE WRITTEN TO WHEREVER FILENAME(SYSPRINT) IS
  ALLOCATED - USUALLY TO THE TERMINAL.

  COPYPDS ALLOWS YOU TO COPY A MEMBER AND ITS ALIAS, WHICH

)X SYNTAX  -
         COPYPDS   'DSNAME1'  'DSNAME2'  SELECT('MEMBERS')
                                         ADD/REPLACE SHR LIST

  EXAMPLES -
         HERE ARE 3 WAYS OF COPYING ONE MEMBER:
             COPYPDS X.DATA Y.DATA SELECT(MEM1)
             COPYPDS X.DATA(MEM1) Y.DATA
             COPYPDS X.DATA(MEM1) Y.DATA(MEM1)
         HERE ARE 2 WAYS OF COPYING ONE MEMBER AND RENAMING IT:
             COPYPDS X.DATA Y.DATA SELECT(MEM1:MEM2)
             COPYPDS X.DATA(MEM1) Y.DATA(MEM2)
         TO COPY 2 MEMBERS (OR ONE MEMBER AND ITS ALIAS):
             COPYPDS X.DATA Y.DATA SELECT(MEM1 MEMA)
         TO COPY ALL MEMBERS:
             COPYPDS X.DATA Y.DATA
)O OPERANDS -
  'DSNAME1' -  THE NAME OF THE INPUT PDS.
             A MEMBER NAME MAY BE SPECIFIED WITH THE DSNAME.
  'DSNAME2' -  THE NAME OF THE OUTPUT PDS. IT MUST ALREADY EXIST.
             A NEW DATA SET WILL NOT BE ALLOCATED IF IT DOES NOT EXIST.
             A MEMBER NAME MAY BE SPECIFIED WITH THE DSNAME (UNLESS
             ONE WAS NOT SPECIFIED WITH 'DSNAME1').
))ADD      - ONLY MEMBERS HAVING NAMES DIFFERENT FROM EXISTING MEMBERS
             IN THE OUTPUT PDS WILL BE COPIED.
             IF YOU EXPLICITLY SPECIFIED MEMBER NAMES, COPYPDS WILL
             TELL YOU WHICH ONES WONT BE COPIED.
             IF YOU DID NOT SPECIFY ANY MEMBER NAMES, A WARNING MESSAGE
             WILL BE ISSUED THAT THERE WILL BE NO INDICATION OF WHICH
             MEMBERS WERE NOT COPIED.
))REPLACE  - ALL MEMBERS WILL BE COPIED, EVEN IF IT MEANS REPLACING
             AN EXISTING MEMBER IN THE OUTPUT PDS.
))SELECT('MEMBERS') - RESTRICTS THE COPY TO SPECIFIC MEMBERS.
             MEMBERS CAN BE GIVEN NEW NAMES AS THEY ARE COPIED,
             BY SPECIFYING SELECT(MEMBER1:NEWNAME1 MEMBER2:NEWNAME2).
             THE COLON AND NEWNAME SHOULD BE OMITTED FOR ANY MEMBERS
             THAT ARE TO HAVE THEIR OLD NAME.
))SHR      - THE OUTPUT PDS WILL BE ALLOCATED SHR INSTEAD OF EXCLUSIVE.
             YOU RISK UNPREDICTABLE RESULTS IF ANOTHER JOB OR USER
             IS WRITING IN THE PDS AT THE SAME TIME.
))LIST     - 'LIST=NO' WILL NOT BE PASSED TO IEBCOPY.
