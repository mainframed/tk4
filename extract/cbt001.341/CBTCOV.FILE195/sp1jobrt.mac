*        PROGRAM NAME JOB ROUTING TABLE
*
*        IF ONE OF THE PROGRAM NAMES BELOW IS FOUND IN THE 'EXEC'
*        STATEMENT OF A JOB'S JCL, THE CPU AFFINITY MASK BELOW IS
*        USED TO ESTABLISH THE CPU AFFINITY OF THE JOB.  IF MORE THAN
*        ONE PROGRAM NAME IS FOUND FOR THE SAME JOB, THE RESPECTIVE
*        MASKS ARE 'AND'ED TOGETHER TO FORM THE RESULTANT CPU AFFINITY.
*        THIS CPU AFFINITY IS THEN 'AND'ED WITH THE CPU AFFINITY
*        SET BY THE READER OR THE /*JOBPARM CARD IN THE USER JCL.
*        THE FINAL CPU AFFINITY IS THE ONE USED BY THE JOB.  IF THE
*        'AND'ING RESULTS IN NO ELIGIBLE PROCESSORS (MASK IS ZERO),
*        THEN THE JOB IS CANCELLED.
*
*        TWO CONTROL CARD TYPES ARE REQUIRED FOR THIS TABLE, THE
*        CPU NAMES CARD ('CPUNAMES' IN COLUMNS 1-8), AND THE
*        PROGRAM NAME CARD (VALID PROGRAM NAME IN COLUMNS 1-8).
*
*        THE CPU NAMES CARD LISTS THE SMF IDS OF ALL CPUS IN THE
*        COMPLEX I-N T-H-E S-A-M-E O-R-D-E-R A-S T-H-E-Y A-R-E
*        G-I-V-E-N I-N JESPARM.  THIS IS CRUCIAL.  IF ANY PROCESSORS
*        ARE ADDED OR DELETED OR THE ORDER THEY HOLD IN THE MAS
*        COMPLEX IS CHANGED IN JESPARM, THE CPUNAMES AND PROGRAM NAME
*        CARDS MUST-MUST-MUST BE UPDATED TO REFLECT THE CHANGE.
*        CPU NAMES BEGIN IN COLUMN 10, WITH A MAXIMUM OF 7 NAMES.
*
*        THE PROGRAM NAME CARD GIVES THE PROGRAM NAME USED FOR AFFINITY
*        AND THE CPU AFFINITY MASK.  THE MASK CONSISTS OF '0'S AND '1'S
*        AND ARE GIVEN IN THE SAME ORDER AS THE CPU NAMES.  COMMENT
*        CARDS ARE USED TO PROVIDE A SCALE.  A '1' IN A MASK POSITION
*        MEANS THE ASSOCIATED PROGRAM IS ELIGIBLE TO RUN ON THE
*        CORRESPONDING PROCESSOR.  A '0' IN A MASK POSITION MEANS
*        THE ASSOCIATED PROGRAM IS NOT ELIGIBLE TO RUN ON THE
*        CORRESPONDING PROCESSOR.
