//*
//* NOTE TO AUBURN:
//*
//* BEFORE TESTING THIS JCL AT AUBURN, CHANGE EVERY OCCURRENCE OF
//* 'CCP11.Q.' TO 'CCP11.QS.' AND EVERY OCCURRENCE OF 'CCP64.' TO
//* 'CCP64.QS.'.  CHANGE THE JOBPARM TIME TO 29 SECONDS AND THE
//* ERIC SPACE ALLOCATION TO 3 CYLINDERS.
//*
//* FUNCTION:
//*
//* BLDE IS THE FIRST OF THE QUANDRY BUILDERS.  IT TAKES AS INPUT
//* E.R.I.C. RIE AND CIJE DATASETS (CCP64.RETR, CCP64.RETC)
//* AND BUILDS THE QUANDRY ERIC FILE (CCP11.Q.E). THE NUMBER OF
//* CIJE RECORDS AND RIE RECORDS TO BE WRITTEN TO THE MASTER FILE
//* ARE SPECIFIED BY PARAMETERS CIJEREC AND RIEREC.  THE REMAINING
//* E.R.I.C. RECORDS ARE WRITTEN TO OVERFLOW TAPES (CCP64.RETCT,
//* CCP64.RETRT) WHICH CAN BE DUMMIED OUT.
//*
//* JCL MODIFICATIONS:
//*
//* JOB CARDS, DEVICE TYPES, VOLUMES, AND SO FORTH MUST BE MODIFIED
//* TO CONFORM TO YOUR INSTALLATION AND REQUIREMENTS. ADDITIONALLY,
//* SEVERAL AUBURN UNIVERSITY UTILITIES ARE USED WHICH MUST BE
//* REPLACED BY CORRESPONDING LOCAL UTILITIES.  ZAP DOES AN
//* IEHPROGM SCRATCH OF DATASETS.  TAPEFILE REQUESTS THE OPERATOR
//* TO FILE A TAPE IN THE MASTER TAPE FILE OR UNCATALOGS A MASTER
//* TAPE AND REQUESTS THE OPERATOR TO RETURN IT TO THE SCRATCH RACK.
//*
//* THE CPU TIME CAN BE REDUCED TO 29 SECONDS AND THE ERIC SPACE
//* ALLOCATION TO 3 CYLINDERS (3350) WHEN BUILDING THE TEST FILES.
//*
//* A FINAL SUGGESTION:  WE FIND IT CONVENIENT AT AUBURN TO RUN A
//* PROGRAM ON THE E.R.I.C. TAPES TO REVERSE THEIR ORDER.  THE
//* MOST RECENT RECORDS WILL THEN BE FOUND FIRST WHEN USING
//* QUANDRY (OR WHEN SEARCHING THE TAPES).
//*
//* RESOURCE ESTIMATES:
//*
//* ONE CYLINDER OF A 3350 WILL HOLD ABOUT 745 CIJE RECORDS AND
//* 348 RIE RECORDS.  SINCE THE SIZE OF THE RECORDS IS VARIABLE,
//* EXACT FIGURES CANNOT BE GIVEN.  RUNNING ON A 158 MOD 1 WITH
//* CIJEREC=120000 AND RIEREC=55000, BLDE TOOK 21 MINUTES OF CPU
//* TIME, DID 41K TAPE OPERATIONS (BLOCKED AT 13030) AND 185K DISK
//* OPERATIONS ON THE AUGUST,  1978 CUMULATIVE E.R.I.C. FILES.
//* CLOCK TIME WAS 2 HOURS, 30 MINUTES.
//*
//* SAMPLE OUTPUT (3350):
//*
//* THE DATASETS SHIPPED FOR CCP64.RETC AND CCP64.RETR CONTAIN
//* 500 RECORDS EACH.  THE OUTPUT FROM BLDE SHOULD READ:
//*
//*          500 DISK CIJE RECORDS WERE WRITTEN.
//*            0 TAPE CIJE RECORDS WERE WRITTEN.
//*          500 TOTAL CIJE RECORDS WERE WRITTEN.
//*            1 CYLINDERS WERE USED FOR CIJE RECORDS.
//*          100 PERCENT OF THE CIJE RECORDS WERE WRITTEN TO DISK.
//*
//*          500 DISK RIE RECORDS WERE WRITTEN.
//*            0 TAPE RIE RECORDS WERE WRITTEN.
//*          500 TOTAL RIE RECORDS WERE WRITTEN.
//*            2 CYLINDERS WERE USED FOR RIE RECORDS.
//*          100 PERCENT OF THE RIE RECORDS WERE WRITTEN TO DISK.
//*
//*       943044 BYTES WERE WRITTEN TO DISK.
//*            3 CYLINDERS WERE USED.
//*    600000065 WAS THE LAST 'RECNO'.
//*
//* THE MAXIMUM RECORD LENGTH WAS 2358.
//* THE AVERAGE RECORD LENGTH WAS  943.
//* THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF CIJE RECORDS PER CYLINDER WAS 500.000
//* THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF RIE  RECORDS PER CYLINDER WAS 250.000
