)F FUNCTION -

  THE  WHERE  COMMAND ALLOWS THE USER TO LOCATE ALL OCCURANCES OF
  A DATA SET NAME AND WILL REPORT IF CATALOGUED. BOTH TAPE AND DISK
  DATA SETS ARE SUPPORTED, HOWEVER VTOC INFORMATION IS NOT REPORTED
  FOR VSAM DATASETS.


)X SYNTAX -

         WHERE  'USER-SUPPLIED-DSN'

)O OPERANDS -

      THE ONLY OPERAND IS  'USER-SUPPLIED-DSN' .


         NOTES:

               1. THE DATA SET NAME SUPPLIED MUST BE IN QUOTES IF THE
                  FULLY QUALIFIED DATASET NAME IS GIVEN.

                  EG.  WHERE 'SYS1.LINKLIB'

               2. IF THE DATASET NAME IS NOT IN QUOTES, THE TSO USERID
                  WILL BE PREFIXED TO THE IT.

                  EG.  WHERE CNTL

               3. POSSIBLE ERROR MESSAGES:

                  A. "INVALID DSN"
                        THIS OCCURS WHEN DSN DOES NOT MEET PROPER
                        SYNTAX OR IF DSN > 44 OR < 1 CHAR. LONG.

                  B.  "DATA SET CANNOT BE FOUND"
                       THIS OCCURS WHEN THE DATA-SET CANNOT BE FOUND,
                       BECAUSE OF MIS-SPELLING OR NON-EXISTANT.

 EXAMPLE :
 *******
           WHERE  'SYS1.LINKLIB'

     THE  "WHERE" COMMAND WILL GENERATE THE FOLLOWING:


 CATALOG INFORMATION:      VOLSER  TYPE  SEQUENCE NUMBER
                           MVT21B  DASD        0

 VTOC    INFORMATION:      VOLSER  TYPE  SEQUENCE NUMBER
                           MVTDDD   PO           1
                           DATA01   PO           1
                           USER01   PO           2
                           MVT21A   PO           1

 DESCRIPTION OF GENERATED REPORT
 *******************************

 1. CATALOG INFORMATION:  CONTAINS THE FOLLOWING:

   VOLSER -- INDICATES THE VOLUME ON WHICH THE CATALOGED DATA SET
             RESIDES ON.

   TYPE ---- INDICATES THE TYPE OF DEVICE ON WHICH THE CATALOGED
             DATA SET RESIDES ON (DASD MEANS DISK) .

   SEQUENCE NUMBER -- INDICATES THE FILE NUMBER (TAPE ONLY) ON THE
             "VOLSER"  ON WHICH THE CATALOGED DATA SET RESIDES ON,
             THIS FIELD SHOULD BE IGNORED FOR DASD DATA SETS.

 2. VTOC INFORMATION:  CONTAINS THE FOLLWOING:

   VOLSER -- INDICATES THE VOLUME ON WHICH THIS DATA SET RESIDES ON.

   TYPE ---- INDICATES THE WHAT TYPE THE DATA SET IS (EG. PO MEANS
             PARTITIONED DATA SET, DA MEANS DIRECT DATA SET, ECT.)

   SEQUENCE NUMBER -- INDICATES THE VOLUME SEQUENCE NUMBER OF THIS
             DATA SET.  THIS VALUE IS OF MEANING IF THE DATA SET
             EXTENDS OVER MORE THEN ONE VOLUME (TAPE OR DISK). IN
             THE EXAMPLE ABOVE THE SECOND OCCURANCE OF SYS1.LINKLIB
             EXTENDS OVER TWO VOLUMES (DATA01 AND USER01).


  COMMENTS
  ********
          A) AS SHOWN IN THE ABOVE EXAMPLE IT IS POSSIBLE FOR A
             DATA SET TO BE CATALOGED ONLY ONCE YET THE DATA SET
             IN FACT CAN RESIDE ON MORE THEN ONE VOLUMES.

          B) IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE FOR A DATA SET NOT TO BE CATALOGED
             AND YET BE ON ONE OR MORE VOLUMES.
