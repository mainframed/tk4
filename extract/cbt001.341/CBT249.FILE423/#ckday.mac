)F FUNCTION        * A utility command for authors of CLISTS *

    CKDAY - Command to check for prior execution on this date of the
            CKDAY command.  This command is expecially useful when
            included in a CLIST that is executed automatically at
            LOGON time.  CKDAY can determine whether it is the first
            execution of the CLIST (therefore the first LOGON of the
            day) and direct the CLIST to perform some action
            appropriate to this first LOGON.

       Check &LASTCC: IF 0, CKDAY has already been executed today.
                         4, CKDAY last executed prior to today.
                         8, CKDAY has never executed (or not executed
                            since CLEARDAY command executed).
                        12, CKDAY can't store date (the area used to
                            store date is in use by some other
                            program).
                        16, Command not running under TSO.
