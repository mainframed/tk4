×   OF PLOTS BASED UPON DATA COLLECTED BY MVS#COL1.                 ×

×   IT IS STRONGLY SUGGESTED THAT ONE HAVE A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING ×
×   OF THE PROGRAM BEFORE UTILIZING IT.  BECAUSE EACH INSTALLATION  ×
×   POSSESSES ITS OWN UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS, THIS PROGRAM IS PRIMARILY×
×   INTENDED TO DEMONSTRATE THE FLEXIBILITY AND CAPABILITY OF SAS   ×
×   IN THE ANALYSIS OF SMF DATA. RATHER THAN BEING UTILIZED IN ITS  ×
×   CURRENT FORM, IT BEST SERVES AS A STARTING POINT FOR THE        ×
