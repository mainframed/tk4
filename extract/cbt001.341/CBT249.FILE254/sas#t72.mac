×   PERFORMANCE GROUP ANALYSIS OF DATA CONTAINED WITHIN THE         ×

×   THIS PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY RUNNING IN AN RMF II, MVS-MP          ×
×   ENVIRONMENT AND CONTAINS SOME CPU-DEPENDENT CODE.               ×

×   IT IS STRONGLY SUGGESTED THAT ONE HAVE A THOROUGH UNDERSTANDING ×
×   OF THE PROGRAM BEFORE UTILIZING IT.  BECAUSE EACH INSTALLATION  ×
×   POSSESSES ITS OWN UNIQUE REQUIREMENTS, THIS PROGRAM IS PRIMARILY×
×   INTENDED TO DEMONSTRATE THE FLEXIBILITY AND CAPABILITY OF SAS   ×
×   IN THE ANALYSIS OF SMF DATA. RATHER THAN BEING UTILIZED IN ITS  ×
×   CURRENT FORM, IT BEST SERVES AS A STARTING POINT FOR THE        ×
×   DEVELOPMENT OF FACILITIES THAT BEST SUIT THE INDIVIDUAL         ×
