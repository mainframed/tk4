            THIS IS A FILE OF THE JCL PROCEDURES FOR USE WITH 2 OTHER
           FILES I HAVE DONATED. BEING AN OS/MVT PERSON (WHEN THINGS
           WERE FREE) I SAVED THE 360 VERSION OF FORTRAN-G AND PL1-F.
           THEN ALONG WITH FORTRAN G IS THE GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER
           VERSION OF FORTRAN-H (THIS IS NOT FORTRAN-H-EXTENDED). THIS
           IS ALL FREE SOFTWARE AND WORKS FINE IN THE MVS WORLD. I HAVE
           BEEN TOLD THAT PL1F DOESN'T FUNCTION IN THE MVS-XA WORLD
           (IF YOU CAN AFFORD MVS-XA, YOU COULD BUY EVERYTHING). THE
           OTHER 2 FILES ARE BUILT AS FOLLOWS:

           PL1FLOAD - THIS CONTAINS THE COMPILER AND LIBRARY FOR PL1F.

           FORTLOAD - THIS CONTAINS THE COMPILERS FOR FORTRAN G &H.
                      ALSO THERE IS THE FORTRAN LIBRARY FOR BOTH OF
                      THEM (SYS1.FORTLIB).

                      REGULAR FORTRAN HAS THE 'STAE' ROUTINE CALLED
                      IHOSTAE. WELL GODDARD'S VERSION HAS GSFSTAE
                      WHICH MUST BE AVAILABLE AT RUNTIME. MY ADVICE
                      IS TO STEPLIB TO THE ENTIRE LIBRARY AT RUN
                      TIME.

            NOTES: YOU CAN FIND OUT ALL THE DEFAULTS BY EXECUTING
                   THE COMPILERS WITH A PARM=   AND LOOK AT WHAT
                   IS SET. HAVE FUN, SO NOW YOU HAVE NO EXCUSE TO
                   IGNORE SOME OF THE MORE INTERESTING (IF YOU KNOW
                   WHAT I MEAN) PROGRAMS ON THE MODS TAPES WRITTEN
                   IN PL1F OR FORTRAN!! (LOOK TO THE HEAVENS)
