Dear Mr. Golob:

      Here are the read and write EXCP-level tape routines we
discussed (I hope you get them, anyway). They were placed on 5 1/4
inch floppies years ago; hope there aren't any typos or such that
cause you to have to figure out what's intended. If there are,
e-mail me and I'll go back to the original assembly listings
(assuming I can still find them) .

Good luck, and regards.
Ron Tatum
