//***FILE 444 is from Ron Tatum of Lubbock, Texas, and contains     *
//*           some routines he wrote in the early days of OS/360    *
//*           computing.  These are VERY noteworthy.                *

//*    CPWTA    - Routine to write tapes with big blocks.           *
//*               Callable subroutine from higher level languages.  *
//*               This routine can write blocks of up to 512K       *
//*               on a tape, by chaining 9 64K CCWs.                *
//*               Actually, this routine can be modified to         *
//*               write even bigger blocks.                         *

//*    CPRDTAPE - Routine to read tapes written by CPWTA.           *
//*               Callable subroutine from higher level languages.  *
//*               This routine has many entry points, depending on  *
//*               function.  This routine can read tapes with       *
//*               blocks of up to 512K.                             *
