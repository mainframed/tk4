With very minor change to INIT and CTGPL source (move $HASPEQU up
till right after the SETC instructions near the end), this version
assembles and works on JES2 Version 5.2.0.   (S.GOLOB per J.SCHUDEL)

This is a quick and dirty hack to get QUEUE working with JES2 5.1.0.

It is based on the old NERDC QUEUE command for JES2 2.2.0,
as modified by William B. Hecox to work with JES2 Version 4.

$$JCL should be used as the model to assemble and link the program.

There are probably problems with system affinities, especially with
system numbers greater than 7.

Please fix any problems you find, and then send the fixes to:
