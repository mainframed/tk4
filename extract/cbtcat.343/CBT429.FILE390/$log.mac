                   FOR THE PASSED IN VALUE OF MTTR.

16 DEC 82  UF043 - CHANGE HELP FOR PFK COMMAND.

21 DEC 82  NOTE -  IT IS POSSIBLE FOR THE SYSTEM TO GENERATE S0C1
                   OR S0C9 ABENDS DURING THE DD COMMAND.  IF THIS
                   HAPPENS, CHECK THE LINKEDIT TO SEE IF THE LENGTH
                   OF THE FINDPDDB ROUTINE (OR ANY OTHER MODULE) IS
                   ZERO.  IF IT IS, RELINK QUEUE WITH AN EXPLICIT
                   INCLUDE CARD FOR THE MODULE.
                   THE PROBLEM IS THAT SOMEWHERE THERE IS A CSECT CARD
                   WITH THE WRONG NAME ON IT.  IN THIS CASE, MODULE
                   CPDDB HAD A FINDPDDB CSECT CARD IN IT INSTEAD OF THE
                   PROPER ONE (CPDDB).  IT HAS BEEN FIXED AS OF
                   23 DEC 82, BUT THERE ARE PROBABLY OLD VERSIONS OUT
                   THAT STILL HAVE THE PROBLEM.

24 JAN 83  PLACED ON JES2 MODS TAPE SP-009.

15 FEB 83  UF083 - CHANGE TGPS COMMAND TO ALSO LIST THE NUMBER OF JOBS
                   THAT HAVE CERTAIN NUMBERS OF TRACK GROUPS ASSIGNED
                   TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO SEE IF THE NUMBER OF BUFFERS
                   IN A TRACK GROUP IS REASONABLE.

20 MAR 83  NOTE -  FOR THE QUEUE COMMAND TO SET QXAUTH BASED UPON
                   THE USER HAVING THE TSO OPER FLAG SET, IT IS
                   NECESSARY FOR THE COMMAND TO BE INVOKED AS A TSO
                   COMMAND, NOT VIA CALL.
                   THIS IS BECAUSE THE CODE ASSUMES THAT UPON ENTRY
                   R1 IS POINTING TO THE CPPL, AND THE CALL ENVIRONMENT
                   DOES NOT SET THINGS UP IN THIS WAY.  NO CHECKING IS
                   DONE TO VERIFY THE ENVIRONMENT UPON ENTRY, OR EVEN
                   IF THE FIELDS POINTED TO BY R1 ARE EVEN IN THE
                   ADDRESSABLE REGION.

29 APR 83  PLACED ON JES2 MODS TAPE SP-011.

09 SEP 83  OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LAB (OR) QAUTH CHECKING MODS ADDED.

09 SEP 83  UF045 - IF MODEL COMMAND IS ISSUED WITHOUT AN OPERAND, AN
                   ABEND S0C7 WILL OCCUR.

18 OCT 83  UF046 - SUPPORT FOR THE SP 1.3.3 LEVEL OF JES2 (HJE2329).

           PDDBS IN THE IOT.

20 JUN 84  CHANGES TO ALLOW PRINTING OUTPUT FROM DUMMY JOBS (RMT...)
           AFFECTS FINDJOB AND LISTDS.

29 JUN 84  CHANGE INIT TO INCREASE THE SIZE OF THE TABLE OF LINE
           NUMBERS TO MTTR'S FROM 64K TO 256K TO ALLOW LOOKING AT
           DUMPS WITH MORE THAN 500,000 RECORDS.

31 AUG 84  SUPPORT FOR SP 1.3.4.
           THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THAT THE $HCT EXPANSION GOT AN
           UNDEFINED SYMBOL FOR $DRAINED, WHICH WAS ADDED TO THE
           3 MODULES THAT NEEDED THE HCT (INIT, CHCT, CTGPS).

10 SEP 84  CHANGE INIT TO FIX A TYPO TO CHANGE 4059 TO 4095.

19 NOV 84  FIX TO UF011 (HEXDUMP + QCOMMON) TO USE NEW FIELD IN
           QCOMMON TO BUILD THE TEXT STRING INTO, INSTEAD OF
           USING QPLINE.  (PRINT OF A HEXDUMP AREA WOULD BLANK
           THE FIRST LINE OF THE FOLLOWING PAGE OF HEX, BECAUSE
           BOTH WERE USING THE SAME WORKAREA.)

30 NOV 84  PLACED ON JES2 MODS TAPE SP-037.

03 DEC 84  ADD MEMBER $$INST TO TRY TO MAKE THE INSTALLATION
           INSTRUCTIONS A LITTLE EASIER TO FIND, AND PERHAPS
           EVEN A LITTLE EASIER TO UNDERSTAND.

06 DEC 84  UF049 FIXES A BUG IN CKPT THAT COULD CAUSE ABEND S0C4

           IDS FROM THE QSE'S RATHER THAN HAVING TO HAVE THEM ASSEMBLED
           IN QCOMMON.
           ALSO CHANGE TO $JQT TO SET THE PROPER NUMBER OF SYSTEM
           QUEUES FOR THIS RELEASE.

22 AUG 86  CHANGE $JQT TO SET JQTQMAX TO 46 INSTEAD OF 47 TO ELIMINATE
           THE ABEND S0C4.

07 OCT 86  MODS FROM SAM GOLOB OF NEWSWEEK - LIVINGSTON N.J.        SBG
              ALLOW A DSID OF 0 TO BE A VALID DSID FOR A JOB.       SBG
           THE REASON FOR THIS MODIFICATION IS THAT RSCS VERSION    SBG
           2.1 GIVES DSID'S OF 0 FOR JOBS IT SENDS TO MVS FOR       SBG
           PRINTING.  MAKE -1, OR X'FFFF' THE INVALID DSID INSTEAD  SBG
           OF ZERO.  (THESE MODIFICATIONS ARE MARKED BY MY INITIALS SBG
           AND BY AN ISPF USERID OF "RSCS2.1").                     SBG
              I'VE INTRODUCED THE POSSIBILITY FOR USERS TO MADE     SBG
           ANOTHER CHANGE.  FOR INFO, SEE MEMBER CALLED $SBGDOC.    SBG
