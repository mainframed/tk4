                       Installation Instructions
                       =========================

You have two options on how to install these add-ons. The easy way,
and the long (but not really hard) way

You should choose the easy way if you trust precompiled versions of
programs.  Then, the only thing you need to do is run the job
                            EZINST$
in this dataset.

Then you should read the documentation members (member names end with
a "@")

Now update SYS1.PARMLIB(COMMND00) with the data in COMMND01

Now update SYS1.PARMLIB(IEASYS00) and add a line

   FIX=00,

(don't forget the comma)

Add or update IEAFIX00 to contain the line

SYS1.LPALIB CMDDUMMY

Finally, pray for the best and do an IPL with the CLPA option

And what is the hard way?  Work yourself through the file
$$README, and through the JCL members in this file (they end in a "$").

Sample JCL can be found in members ending with a "#"

In any case, you should work through the members CBTxx, which
reorganize the catalog structure of the CBT files in the
turnkey system
