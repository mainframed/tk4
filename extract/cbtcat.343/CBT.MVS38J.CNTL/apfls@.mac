 This program scans PARMLIB for members with the name IEAAPFxx.
 For each line in each member the following checks are made:

  a1) Is the dataset cataloged?
  a2) If yes, is the dataset cataloged on the named volume?
  b)  Is the named volume available?
  c)  Is the dataset physically located on the named volume?

  Required DD names:

  PARMLIB    points to PDS with IEAAPFxx members to be checked
  SYSPRINT   output queue for report

  Assembly and Link JCL can be found in CBT.MVS38J.CNTL(APFCK#)
  Execution JCL can be found in         CBT.MVS38J.CNTL(APFCK$)
