//*      ALL REXX SMF STUFF MUST BE RECFM=VB INSTEAD OF             *
//*      RECFM=VBS AS REXX CANNOT HANDLE SPANNED RECORDS.           *
//*                                                                 *
//*      $$$DOC   - This member                                     *

//*      AL       - Good when you are at 3.4 and need to            *
//*                 duplicate a dataset                             *
//*                                                                 *
//*      COMMAND  - Added support for 4 digit reply id to           *
//*                 program from File 019 issue 'FIND *JAW*' to     *
//*                 see my changes.                                 *
//*                                                                 *
//*      COPYLNES - Great taking a dataset file and then create     *
//*                 a record before each.  This is great for        *
//*                 creating multi-line control cards               *
//*                                                                 *
//*      DMPGENER - This simple REXX takes a dataset list and       *
//*                 generates control cards for DFDSS.  I use       *
//*                 this same example to create JCL and other       *
//*                 control card schemes.                           *
//*                                                                 *
//*      FTAILSMF - FTAILSMF is BAL program that shows the power    *
//*                 of ISPF calls. You can easily manage datasets   *
//*                 using ISPF calls which do the SVC 99 stuff      *
//*                 under the doors. Also, a REXX version in there. *
//*                                                                 *
//*      IEFUJI   - IEFUJI exit to gets info from ACF2.  Probably   *
//*                 would not take much to get from RACF or Top     *
//*                 Secret also.  Also creates an SMF record        *
//*                 (128) processed by SMF128J.                     *
//*                                                                 *
//*      JOBID    - Simple REXX to find JOBID                       *
//*                                                                 *
//*      MSGCHECK - Little REXX program to check MPF.  IEAVMXIT     *
//*                 must be active for some AUTOOPS packages.       *
//*                                                                 *
//*      RDATE    - REXX date routine. Recently added some Y2K      *
//*                 updates.  REXX date function has most of this   *
//*                 support today.  Originally a CLIST from CBT,    *
//*                 I believe, that I converted to REXX and         *
//*                 updated.                                        *
//*                                                                 *
//*      RXJOBID  - Assembler REXX function same as JOBID above.    *
//*                 Shows how simple BAL REXX functions are.        *
//*                                                                 *
//*      SEQNUM   - Handy member.  I once had a job with a          *
//*                 zillion steps all with the same name.  This     *
//*                 edit macro made each step unique.               *
//*                                                                 *
//*      SMF128   - For poor shops without SAS, REXX is a great     *
//*                 tool for quick SMF data reports for auditors    *
//*                 or bean counters.                               *
//*                                                                 *
//*      SMF128J  - JCL to invoke SMF128 user SMF record from       *
//*                 IEFUJI.                                         *
//*                                                                 *
//*      SMF170   - For poor shops without SAS, REXX is a great     *
//*                 tool for quick SMF data reports for auditors    *
//*                 or bean counters. SMF170 records from FILEAID   *
//*                 require an AUTHSVC.                             *
//*                                                                 *
//*      SMF170J  - JCL to invoke SMF170 to report on               *

//*      PCOPY    - This edit macro extends the power of the        *
//*                 COPY command.  PCOPY can copy a PROC member     *
//*                 without the intervening copy panel.  I need     *
//*                 to expand this for non-pds's also.              *
//*                                                                 *
//*      COBPRT   - Simple program to test our Y2K date             *
//*                 simulator.  This executes COBOL II date         *
//*                 calls.  COBOL for MVS has some examples in      *
//*                 the IVP.                                        *
//*                                                                 *
//*      PLIAVG   - Simple program to test our Y2K date             *
//*                 simulator.  This executes PLI date calls at     *
//*                 the 2.3 level.                                  *
//*                                                                 *
//*      STCK     - Simple program to test our Y2K date             *
//*                 simulator.  This executes a STCK instruction.   *
//*                                                                 *
//*      TIMEPC   - Simple program to test our Y2K date             *
//*                 simulator.  This executes a TIME PC call.       *
//*                                                                 *
//*      TIMEX    - Simple program to test our Y2K date             *
//*                 simulator.  This executes a regular TIME        *
//*                 call.                                           *
//*                                                                 *
//*      TOUPPERC - Xpediter will not handle lower case             *
//*                 code as of 10-06-1999. Converts all text        *
//*                 to uppercase prior to assembly.                 *
//*                                                                 *
//*      TOUPPERJ - Job to run invoke TOUPPERC against your         *
//*                 PDS. It uses STARTOOL or PDS85 to invoke.       *
//*                 Good control card examples.                     *
//*                                                                 *
//*      WTOAGL01 - Example of a TSO exit to start all VTAM         *
//*                 appls at our site.  Would require a IST020I     *
//*                 entry to start this exit in MPFLST00.  The      *
//*                 last byte of each of our SMF ids is unique,     *
//*                 such as SYSA, SYSB, or SYSC.  It grabs the      *
//*                 character, as we have unique requirements for   *
//*                 each system.                                    *
//*                                                                 *
