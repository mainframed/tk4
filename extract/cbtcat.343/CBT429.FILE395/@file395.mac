//***FILE 395 is from Seymour Metz, and contains a REXX exec        *
//*           that can be very useful when putting up a new MVS     *
//*           system.                                               *
//*                                                                 *
//*           email:   "Metz, Seymour" <smetz@nsf.gov>              *
//*                                                                 *
//*           This EXEC catalogs all of the PO and PS datasets      *
//*           on a volume using the extended indirect format.       *
//*           It assumes that all of the volumes of a system        *
//*           have a common 3-character prefix, that the last       *
//*           three characters are one of DLB, DL2, RES or RS2      *
//*           and that the static system variables &SYSDL1,         *
//*           &SYSDL2, &SYSR1 and &SYSR2 will refer to those        *
//*           volumes.                                              *
//*                                                                 *
//*           If a catalog is not supplied, then the master         *
//*           catalog is assumed.                                   *
//*                                                                 *
//*           I'd say that the user has to customize this EXEC      *
//*           to his/her local situation, but it's a good starting  *
//*           point.  (S.Golob  9/99)                               *
