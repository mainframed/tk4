     This EXEC catalogs all of the PO and PS datasets on a volume
     using the extended indirect format.  It assumes that all of
     the volumes of a system have a common 3-character prefix,
     that the last three characters are one of DLB, DL2, RES or
     RS2 and that the static system variables &SYSDL1, &SYSDL2,
     &SYSR1 and &SYSR2 will refer to those volumes.

     If you do not supply a catalog then the master catalog is
     implied.
