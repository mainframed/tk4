//***FILE 477 is from Brandon Hill and contains a program,          *
//*           called AWSUTIL, which takes MVS data from either      *
//*           disk or tape, and creates a "virtual tape file"       *
//*           in AWS format.  This file, which contains all the     *
//*           data normally in a complete tape, can then be         *
//*           electronically sent anywhere.  You no longer have     *
//*           to ship a physical tape.                              *
