Can a real, hardware 9672 or 3090 do anything useful with AWSTAPE
format files?  No, not really.

However, here is my use for them:

I have a handful of old reel tapes from my high school and college
days.  I am attempting to copy them to something (a few already have
data checks) to save them.

I found AWSTAPE a useful format to just store a tape file in so that
an actual tape may be produced at a later date.  It stores files,
blocks, marks, and whatnot transparently.  I had no better ideas
(actually, my first attempt was DSORG=PS, LRECL=32756,
BLKSIZE=32760, RECFM=VB) so I used it for my personal archiving
project.

Just so happens that under Hercules, these are (more or less) real
tapes.

One note:  I read on the Hercules list that the actual AWSTAPE
specification only allows 4096 bytes/block header.  My program puts
the whole block under one block header.  Hercules doesn't seem to
care.  The length fields are long enough.  I'll fix it when I've
nothing better to do, but it seems ok for now.
