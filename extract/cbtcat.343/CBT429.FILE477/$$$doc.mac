* Abstract:                                                           *
*                                                                     *
* This is a fairly comprehensive program for creating virtual tape    *
* files.  Labels can be generated.  Tape marks can be written.        *
* Any dataset that can be accessed by BSAM can be copied.  Any real   *
* tape device can have either a single file, or the entire tape       *
* copied.                                                             *
*                                                                     *
* Commands are read from SYSIN and status and errors are written to   *
* SYSPRINT.  The AWS TAPE image is written to SYSOUT as a VB file     *
* that is suitable to be copied with FTP in binary mode to any other  *
* system.                                                             *
*                                                                     *
* Any number of DD statements representing sequential data and tapes  *
* may be specified and read via the appropriate statements in SYSIN.  *
*                                                                     *

*  Perform EXCP read from a real tape device and convert each block   *
*  to AWS TAPE format.  Only works on a tape device.  Maximum BLKSIZE *
*  is 65535.  This command stops reading when a tape mark is read.    *
*  Therefore, only the current tape file is processed.  If BLP were   *
*  used, only the tape headers would be processed.                    *
*                                                                     *

*  Perform EXCP read from a real tape device and convert each block   *
*  to AWS TAPE format.  Only works on a tape device.  Maximum BLKSIZE *
*  is 65535.  This command rewinds the tape and reads until an error  *
*  condition is returned.  This effectively copies the entire contents*
*  of the tape.  BLP is not necessary, as a Rewind command is sent    *
*  before the tape is read.  Tape marks are duplicated as they are    *
*  encountered.                                                       *

*  NOTE: Because end of reel reflectors are rarely effective, this    *
*        command can run a tape off the reel on a 3420 type drive.    *
*        3480/3490/3590 type drives have better stopping mechanisms.  *
*        You have been warned.                                        *
*                                                                     *

*  Write a tape mark to the output file.  This is usually used to     *
*  separate individual files on a tape.  Two consecutive tape marks   *
*  sometimes signals the end of the tape.                             *
*                                                                     *

*  Print a message after each command verifying that the command was  *
*  executed ok.  This merely prints a message.  It has no effect on   *
*  the integrity of the data.  Because SYSOUT should be directed to   *
*  disk, there should be no data integrity problems, anyway.          *
*                                                                     *

*  All subsequent labels generated are converted to ASCII before they *
*  are written.  This only affects labels.  All data is copied        *
*  exactly as it is read no matter the setting of this command.       *
*                                                                     *

*  All subsequent labels generated are not to be converted before they*
*  are written.  The implication is that the data is still in EBCDIC  *
*  format.  This only affects labels.  All data is copied exactly as  *
*  it is read no matter the setting of this command.                  *
*                                                                     *

*  These commands write 80 byte labels to the tape image.  The format *
*  of the labels is controlled by the ASCII and EBCDIC commands.      *
*  Except for the first 4 bytes of each input line, none of the data  *
*  is checked to make sure it is a valid tape label.  It is up to the *
*  user to provide correctly formatted labels as desired.             *
*                                                                     *
*  Essentially, the entire 80 byte input record is written to the     *
*  AWS TAPE image as is (or converted to ASCII if the flag is set)    *
*                                                                     *
