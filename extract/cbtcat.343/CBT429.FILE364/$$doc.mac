     Hi again Sam,

What follows is from the original question from Bill Lee that
prompted me to send the CCSS Source to you for the CT tape.

It would/should probably be added to the Documentation on this.

Personally I would just code //SYSIN DD DSN=XX.XX(MEM) for the
control cards and put the control cards in a dataset.

At one time there was something on one of the SHARE tapes called
Control Card Subsystem that would allow you to use control cards as
JCL parameters instead of using a DD *. In other words, instead of
coding:

//SYSIN DD *
CONTROL CARD #1
CONTROL CARD #2
CONTROL CARD #3
/*

you would code:

//SYSIN DD SUBSYS=(CCSS,
//      'CONTROL CARD #1',
//      'CONTROL CARD #2',
//     'CONTROL CARD #3')

The advantage is that you could then code your control cards within
a cataloged procedure and avoid using an override. Does anyone know
where I can obtain a copy of CCSS?

Thanks in advance for your help,

Bill
