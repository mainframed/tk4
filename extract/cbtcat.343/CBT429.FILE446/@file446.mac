//***FILE 446 is from John McKown and contains a COBOL program      *
//*           which uses OS/390 UNIX services.  It's good to have   *
//*           a program like this, for a coding example.            *
//*                                                                 *

//*     This program is a small example (341 lines of code) of      *
//*     how to use COBOL to write an OS/390 UNIX System Services    *
//*     program. The program uses the BPX1WRT subroutine to         *
//*     write to STDOUT. It uses this interface to write the        *
//*     UNIX parameters (like C's argc and argv).  It also uses     *
//*     that interface to write out the currently set               *
//*     environment variables.  For example:                        *
//*                                                                 *
//*     ./UNIX0002 arg1 arg2 arg3                                   *

//*     would result in output such as:                             *
//*                                                                 *
