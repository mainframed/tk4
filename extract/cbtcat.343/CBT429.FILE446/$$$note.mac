I don't know how much interest this would have, but I have gone
insane and written a COBOL program. This program is a small example
(341 lines of code) of how to use COBOL to write an OS/390 UNIX
System Services program. The program uses the BPX1WRT subroutine to
write to STDOUT. It uses this interface to write the UNIX parameters
(like C's argc and argv). It also uses that interface to write out
the currently set environment variables.  For example:

./UNIX0002 arg1 arg2 arg3

would result in output such as:

NUMBER OF ARGUMENT IS: 4
ARGCª 000³=./UNIX0002
ARGCª 001³=arg1
ARGCª 002³=arg2
ARGCª 003³=arg3

NUMBER OF ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES IS: 3
ENVª 000³=VAR1=VALUE1
ENVª 001³=VAR2=VALUE2
ENVª 002³=VAR3=VALUE3

This is a single, COBOL source program.
