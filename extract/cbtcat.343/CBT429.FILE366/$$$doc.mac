I've attached a fancy ISPF application I got a few years ago that
shows the world time zones.  I don't know who wrote it, it was
passed on to me.  It's been modified to put Jacksonville on the
screen.  To use, put WW$EXEC in your //SYSPROC or //SYSEXEC
and put WW$PANEL in your panel library as "WW".


The other program included here is a REXX exec that's called PDSADD.
The function of PDSADD is to look at a partitioned dataset, and
place a ./ ADD NAME=membname card at the beginning of each member.
You can use this function for whatever purpose suits your fancy.
The REXX code that scans the pds directory, and finds each member
name, is also good code to look at, or to copy, if you need it.
