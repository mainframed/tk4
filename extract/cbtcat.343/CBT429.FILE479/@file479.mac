//***FILE 479 is a collection of programs from Paul W. Lemons.      *
//*           Currently, this collection consists of three TSO      *
//*           programs.                                             *
//*                                                                 *
//*           email:   Paul W Lemons <plemons2@txu.com>             *
//*                                                                 *
//*      BCEDIT    - A set of REXX execs to edit and update         *
//*                  the current Global Notification records        *
//*                  in SYS1.BRODCAST.  These are the messages      *
//*                  that are displayed to everyone by the          *
//*                  LISTBC program, when they LOGON to TSO.        *
//*                  The system administrator can maintain these    *
//*                  notices easily with the help of these EXECs.   *
//*                                                                 *
//*      BKSEARCH  - A frontend to IBM's Bookmanager.  It is        *
//*                  designed to be cursor sensitive and will       *
//*                  search for an abend code or a system message   *
//*                  in the books contained in the IBM messages     *
//*                  bookshelf.  It would require that bookshelf    *
//*                  to have been uploaded and the BookManager      *
//*                  clist library to be allocated.  This code      *
//*                  will accept an abend code or message as a      *
//*                  parm.  However the best way to implement       *
//*                  would be to assign it to a PFKey and then      *
//*                  pressing that PFKey to read the data at the    *
//*                  cursor position.  This is NOT an edit macro    *
//*                  and should work from anywhere within ISPF.     *
//*                  I would be remiss in not acknowledging Doug    *
//*                  Nadel's %VCURSOR code that is an integral      *
//*                  part of this code.                             *
//*                                                                 *
//*      YAHTZEE   - A single player version of the YAHTZEE game    *
//*                  that runs under TSO.                           *
//*                                                                 *
