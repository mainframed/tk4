Sent a couple of TSO Rexx/clists that others may be interested in.

The first is a broadcast editor which allows the use of the ISPF
editor to edit the system broadcast general notification messages.
These are not the user messages.

IE these are messages that everyone sees when they logon to TSO.
The driver is BCEDIT and it uses 2 edit macros; BCEDITM1 and
BCEDITM2.

The second is BKSEARCH, a frontend to IBM's Bookmanager.  It is
designed to be cursor sensitive and will search for an abend code or
a system message in the books contained in the IBM messages
bookshelf.  It would require that bookshelf to have been uploaded
and the BookManager clist library to be allocated.  This code will
accept an abend code or message as a parm however the best way to
implement would be to assign it to a PFKey and then pressing that
PFKey to  read the data at the cursor position.  This is NOT an edit
macro and should work from anywhere within ISPF.   I would be remiss
in not acknowledging Doug Nadel's %VCURSOR code that is an integral
part of this code.

Also included is a set of rexx code that is a single player version
of yahtzee for the mainframe.  It has lots of members so I'd send it
in xmit format.  Thanks to all those involved at CBT for their time
and effort.
