//***FILE 473 is from Scott Finlayson, and contains a program to    *
//*           check for all ASID's (address space id slots) that    *
//*           have become non-reusable. The program displays the    *
//*           list of non-reusable ASID's at the console,           *
//*           together with the total number of ASID's defined,     *
//*           and the total number still available.  Tells you      *
//*           when it's time to IPL.  Useful if you're like our     *
//*           shop and wait a long time between IPL's.  Good for    *
//*           a 24x7, or a pseudo 24x7 environment.                 *
//*                                                                 *
//*           Sample output for the program follows:                *
//*                                                                 *
//* NON-REUSEABLE ASIDS: 00487 00488 00489 00490 00491 00492 00493  *
//* NON-REUSEABLE ASIDS: 00494 00496 00497 00498 00499 00500 00501  *
//* NON-REUSEABLE ASIDS: 00502 00503 00504 00505 00506 00507 00508  *
//* NON-REUSEABLE ASIDS: 00509 00510 00511 00512                    *
//* ASID MAX = 00528; ASIDS AVAILABLE = 00147; NON-REUSABLES = 00221*
//*                                                                 *
//*           CHKASVT can be run from TSO as well, as a command,    *
//*           but it also puts its output to the system log, at     *
//*           the same time.                                        *
//*                                                                 *
