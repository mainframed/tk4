Note for CHKASVT program:

  Our shop goes a long time between IPL's, and it pays to check
  if a lot of ASID's are becoming unusable.  This program, CHKASVT
  does that job, and is a factor in convincing management that we
  need an IPL soon.

Another note:  The IEFSAVER and IEFRELSE macros are included in
  another of Scott's programs, which is not in this file.
  Since these are program entry and exit macros, I just kept the
  two macros here, for your general interest.
