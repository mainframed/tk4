NODSI

Function

This program is to allow manipulation of datasets that are ENQ-ed upon.
These ENQs would regularly be prohibitive, however this program will
intercept SYSDSN ENQ such that no conflicts will arise and the function
will proceed as if no ENQ exists.


Using NODSI

The following JOB will invoke IEHPROGM through NODSI in order to
delete datasets that have an ENQ against them. Any other MVS program may
be executed this way such as:

   1.IDCAMS
   2.ADRDSSU
   3.IKJEFT01

//IBMUSERD JOB ,'JAN JAEGER'
//NODSI    EXEC PGM=NODSI,PARM='IEHPROGM,LINECNT=66'
//VOLDD    DD  UNIT=3380,VOL=SER=STOR01,DISP=OLD
//SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
//SYSIN    DD  *
 SCRATCH DSNAME=IBMUSER.ZZ,VOL=3380=STOR01
/*
