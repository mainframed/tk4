I had asked about getting a current date
automagically embedded in a DSN in a
batch job. Someone asked about a summary.

a.) It can be done with a CA-7 module.
b.) It can be done with CLIST/REXX/Skeleton stuff.
c.) It can be done with an Assembler routine.
d.) It can be done with a IEFUJV exit.

I'm not particularly well qualified to elaborate
on a.) - d.), but if anyone needs to pursue this
I might be able to connect you with someone more
knowledgable.

I have a variant of (c.) that I implemented on our test LPAR.  A
simple assembler program (could be almost any language, actually)
is run automatically at midnight.  It rewrites a proclib member
that contains SET commands to define the desired symbolic date
parameters.  This member can then be copied in by any batch job,
and the values used to generate names.

? started task called MIDNIGHT is run at midnight by JES2.  It
  does several housekeeping things, one is to run proc SYSDATEP.
? proc SYSDATEP does EXEC PGM=SYSDATE, which has OUTPUT DD
  pointing to a proclib member called SYSDATE.
? program SYSDATE gets date, formats it several ways, writes
  several SET statements, e.g. // SET SYSYEAR 00 into PROCLIB
  member.
? batch job does // INCLUDE MEMBER=SYSDATE
? batch job can then have a DD statement with parameter like
  DSN=userid.Y&SYSYEAR..D&SYSMONTH&SYSDAY

We never put it in production, but it's been running on our test
LPAR for a year without any problems.  One might to change these
symbol names to avoid any conflict with IBM system variables.  I
can furnish the program to anyone who's interested-email me
directly as I don't read this list every day.
