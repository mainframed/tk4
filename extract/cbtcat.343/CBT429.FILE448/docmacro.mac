Some useful macros --

The following are the macros used in the SETDATE program; all are genera
useful for other programs as well.  I've also included one additional ma
EDIT, that is not used by SETDATE.

EDIT     Construct a pattern, convert to decimal, issue ED instruction t
         format an integer value into a message.

ENTER    Save registers, chain save areas, establish addressability for
         non-reentrant programs.  Provides common addressability across
         multiple entry points, supports multiple entry points.

EXIT     Restore registers, unchain save areas, set return code, return
         caller.

FILL     Pad a message field to a specified length.

REGISTER Equates to define symbolic register names (R1, etc.)
