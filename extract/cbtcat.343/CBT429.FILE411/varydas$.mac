Vary DASD Volumes Offline By Volser
-----------------------------------

1.0 Installation of VARYDASD

    Supplied Material :
    README.TXT    -  This file
    VARYDASD.TXT  -  Assembler source code for the VARYDASD function

    (a) File transfer the VARYDASD.TXT file to the mainframe host
        using ASCII-EBCDIC translation.

    (b) Assemble and link VARYDASD into an APF authorised load library.
        Use the following linkedit attributes :
           AMODE(31)
           RMODE(24)
           NORENT
           NOREUS
           NOREFR
           AC(1)

 2.0 Using VARYDASD

     The VARYDASD program is used to vary DASD devices offline
     at IPL time by volser rather than the normal unit address
     specification.

     This drastically reduces the possible errors that could
     result from the COMMNDxx member of PARMLIB being out of
     date.

     The VARYDASD started task JCL is as follows :

      //VARYDASD PROC MEMBER=&SYSCLONE,TYPE=APPLY,WTO=BOTH
      //*
      //VARY   EXEC PGM=VARYDASD,PARM='TYPE=&TYPE,WTO=&WTO',TIME=1440
      //SYSIN  DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS1.PARMLIB(DASD&MEMBER)

     During IPL, an entry in the COMMNDxx member invokes this
     started task by issuing the command :

         'S VARYDASD,SUB=MSTR'

     Note that the STC is started under the MASTER subsystem, so
     that it can run before JES2 has started.

     When started, the program will read some SYSIN cards that
     specify the volser patterns of volumes that are to remain
     online. The program then scans through the online DASD
     units and attempts to match the volser from a unit to any
     of the specified patterns.

     If a match is found, a message is issued stating that the
     volume is to remain ONLINE. If no match is found, a message
     is issued stating that the volume is to be varied offline
     and its unit address is varied offline after all DASD units
     have been processed.

     The SYSIN Cards
     ---------------

     The SYSIN cards must be 80-byte images with the volser
     pattern placed in columns 1-6. A single character wildcard of
     '%' can be used to signify any character. All six character
     MUST be specified (eg if you wish to keep all volumes
     starting 'D2' online, you must use 'D2%%%%' and not 'D2*' or
     'D2%'

     System symbols are supported as SYSIN cards, but the
     trailing dot must not be specified and the symbol name must
     be exactly six characters long.

     Comments are indicated by any of the following :
     (a) Blank in column 1
     (b) Asterix in column 1
     (c) '/*' in columns 1-2

     Example valid SYSIN cards
     -------------------------

     PAGE%%
     D%MV%%
     JES2%%
     &SYSR1
     &SYSR2

     The reccommended place for the SYSIN cards is in member
     DASDxx in PARMLIB.

     Runtime paramters
     -----------------

     The program accepts two optional runtime paramters : TYPE and WTO

     The TYPE keyword indicates the runtime mode as follows :

     (1) TYPE=CHECK
         The program issues messages indicating the resultant
         status of the device.  No action is taken against any of
         the DASD units.  This mode allows the user to verify
         the SYSIN cards.
         This is the default.

     (2) TYPE=APPLY
         The program varies the required devices offline to the
         system.

     The WTO keyword indicates the message level used by the program :

     (1) WTO=NONE
         No WTOs indicating device status are issued by this program
     (2) WTO=ONLINE
         A WTO is issued for each device that is to remain ONLINE
     (3) WTO=OFFLINE
         A WTO is issued for each device that is to be varied OFFLINE
     (4) WTO=BOTH
         A WTO is issued for each device that is to be varied
         OFFLINE and also for devices that remain ONLINE.
         This is the default
