Generate the CONFIGxx Member
----------------------------

1.0 Installation of CONFIGXX

    Supplied Material :
    README.TXT    -  This file
    CONFIGXX.TXT  -  Assembler source code for the CONFIGXX function

    (a) File transfer the CONFIGXX.TXT file to the mainframe host
        using ASCII-EBCDIC translation.

    (b) Assemble and link CONFIGXX into any load library.
        Use the following linkedit attributes :
           AMODE(31)
           RMODE(24)
           NORENT
           NOREUS
           NOREFR
           AC(0)

 2.0 Using CONFIGXX

     The CONFIGXX program is used to create the CONFIGxx member of
     PARMLIB.  The basic idea being that you would run the CONFIGXX
     program at a time that you are satisfied that everything that
     should be online is online and that everything that should be
     offline is also offline.

     The program generates the following CONFIGxx statements :

     (1) CPU (x)
     (2) STOR 0M-nnnM
     (3) ESTOR 0M-nnnM
     (4) DEV(uuuu),(chp,chp,chp....)

     The required JCL is as follows :

        //CONFIG   EXEC PGM=CONFIGXX
        //PARMLIB  DD   DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS1.PARMLIB(CONFIG00)

     When started, the program will analyze the system and
     produce the following :

     (1) A 'CPU (x)' statement for each online CPU.
     (2) A 'STOR 0M-nnnnM' statement to reflect the amount of
         real storage
     (3) An 'ESTOR 0M-nnnnM' statement to reflect the amount of
         expanded storage
     (4) A 'DEV(uuuu),(chp,chp...)' statement for each online
         device 'uuuu' with its online CHPids in one of more
         'chp'.

     Note that the 'DEV' statements are grouped into device
     class sections and also that the UCB type is written as
     comments. For DASD devices, the current volser is also
     written as a comment.
