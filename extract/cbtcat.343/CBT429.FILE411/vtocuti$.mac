 List and Alter Format-1 DSCB Information - VTOCUTIL
 ---------------------------------------------------

 Installation of VTOCUTIL
 ------------------------

 Place the VTOCUTIL load module into an APF authorised dataset. Source
 code for the VTOCUTIL is not available.

 Using VTOCUTIL
 --------------

 VTOCUTIL lists and optionally alters information in Format-1 DSCBs for
 specified datasets. The action taken depends on the parameters passed
 to the program and the control statements read from the SYSIN DDName.

 VTOCUTIL uses authorized services and MUST be executed from an APF auth
 dataset.

 VTOCUTIL only examines and optionally changes the VTOC for volumes with
 indexed VTOCs. Not attempt is made to access the VVDS or catalogs in an
 Therefore care must be taken when dealing with SMS datasets or cataloge
 datasets. Any changes to the F1-DSCB made by VTOCUTIL will NOT be refle
 in the VVDS or catalog.

 If VTOCUTIL is used to change the dataset name portion of the F1-DSCB,
 VTOC index will not reflect the change performed. To correct this, you
 run the ICKDSF BUILDIX utility to disable and rebuild the VTOC index.

 Explanation of VTOCUTIL JCL
 ---------------------------

 PARM Values
 -----------

     MODE=CHECK   Specifies the execution mode of VTOCUTIL.
          UPDATE

     MODE=CHECK   Indicates that no actual updates are made to the
                  VTOC but actions that would have been successful are
                  indicated in the Action Summary Report produced
                  SYSPRINT DDName. This is the default value.

     MODE=UPDATE  Indicates that the VTOC is updated with any
                  successful changes produced as a result of the SYSIN
                  cards.


     ENQ=FAIL     Controls the serialization to the dataset during DSCB
         WAIT     update. This parameter only applies if VTOCUTIL is
         BYPASS   running with MODE=UPDATE.

     ENQ=FAIL     Indicates that the update to the DSCB is to be failed
                  if the dataset is in use. This is the default value.

     ENQ=WAIT     Indicates that VTOCUTIL is to wait for exclusive
                  control of the dataset before updating the DSCB.

     ENQ=BYPASS   Indicates that no serialization is to be attempted
                  for the dataset during DSCB update processing.


 DDNames Used
 ------------

     SYSPRINT Will contain the Action Summary Report produced by VTOCUTI
     Required DCB : RECFM=FB, LRECL=133

     DSCBLIST Will contain the DSCB Listing Report produced by VTOCUTIL.
       Required DCB : RECFM=FB, LRECL=133

     VTOC  Specifies the volume serial and unit type of the DASD volume
       whose VTOC is to be processed.

     SYSIN  Control statements passed to VTOCUTIL.
       Required DCB : RECFM=FB, LRECL=80


 Control Statements
 ------------------

 o Control statements can start in any column and must end before
   column 71.
 o Continuations are NOT permitted.
 o Comments are indicated by an asterix ('*') in column 1.
 o All of the VER and REP type keywords will be applied to ALL
   datasets that have passed the INCLUDE and EXCLUDE criteria,
   regardless of the order in which they appear in the SYSIN
   dataset.
 o Multiple statements of the same type are allowed.
 o The only required control statement is INCLUDE.

    INCLUDE
      Specifies the dataset name pattern that is used to decide which
      datasets on the DASD volume are included for processing.

      Syntax :

      INCLUDE pattern

      The 'pattern' may use the asterix ('*') to indicate a wildcard and
      the percent sign ('%') to indicate a placeholder.

      Example :

      INCLUDE IBMUSER.*
      INCLUDE SYS%.CA*.LINKLIB

    EXCLUDE
      Specifies the dataset name pattern that is used to decide which
      datasets on the DASD volume are excluded for processing.

      Syntax :

      EXCLUDE pattern

      The 'pattern' may use the asterix ('*') to indicate a wildcard and
      the percent sign ('%') to indicate a placeholder.

      Example :

      INCLUDE IBMUSER.*
      EXCLUDE IBMUSER.TEST.*


    VER

      0 to 9 and A to F, although the 'hexdata' can be split by commas f
      readability purposes.

      Example :

      VER 0052 4000

      a single byte in the Format-1 DSCB in order for the dataset to be
      processed.

      Syntax :

      VERBITON offset bitmask

      The verify is accepted if the bits specified by 'bitmask' are ON
      in the DSCB.

      Both the 'offset and 'bitmask' must only contain the EBCDIC charac
      0 to 9 and A to F. The 'bitmask' must contain only the two EBCDIC
      characters that make up a single hex byte.

      The verify is accepted if the bits specified by 'bitmask' are OFF
      in the DSCB.

      Both the 'offset and 'bitmask' must only contain the EBCDIC charac
      0 to 9 and A to F. The 'bitmask' must contain only the two EBCDIC
      characters that make up a single hex byte.

      the contents of the Format-1 DSCB.

      Syntax :

      REP offset hexdata

      Both the 'offset and 'hexdata' must only contain the EBCDIC charac
