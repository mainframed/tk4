 available to your TSO userid. Use the following
 linkedit attributes :

        AMODE(31)
        RMODE(ANY)
        RENT
        REUS
        AC(0)

 Using SLEEP

 The program will wait for a specified amount of seconds. The number
 of seconds to wait for is passed as a parameter to the function
 by the invoking REXX Exec. If no parameter is passed, a default of
 10 seconds is used. The maximum specification is 99999 seconds.

 Syntax :

     rcode = SLEEP(secs)

 Keywords :

       The return code from the SLEEP function. This can be one of
       the following values :
         0  - Successful execution of the function
        -1  - Error in the parameter passed. Verify that the
              seconds passed is numeric and between 1 and 99999.

     SECS
       The number of seconds to wait for. This value can be between 1 an
       99999. If not specified, SLEEP will use a default value of 10.
