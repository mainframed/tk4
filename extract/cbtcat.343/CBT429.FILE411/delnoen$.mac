 Delete Datasets Without the SYSDSN Enqueue
 ------------------------------------------

 Installation of DELNOENQ

 Assemble and link DELNOENQ into an APF authorised load library.
 Use the following linkedit attributes :

    AMODE(24)
    RMODE(24)
    NORENT
    NOREUS
    NOREFR
    AC(1)


 Additional thanks to Brian Pierce of IBM for the code updates that
 allow the DSN and VOL keywords to be supplied in any order and also
 handling the situation where the dataset in aliased to another name.


 Using DELNOENQ

 The DELNOENQ program runs as a batch job and deletes specified
 uncataloged datasets from DASD volumes. The datasets to be
 deleted are nominated via a series of SYSIN cards. To use the
 SYSDSN enqueue bypass facility, this program must be linked
 AC(1) and must be executed from an APF-authorised load library.

 SYSIN Card Syntax :

      DSN=dataset_name,VOL=volser

 Keywords :

      DSN=dataset_name
        The name of the dataset to be deleted. This must be a fully
        qualified dataset name (without quotes).

      VOL=volser
        The DASD volume serial that contains the dataset to be
        deleted.

 Important Notes :

 (1)  The combination of dataset_name and volser must not match the
      cataloged version of the dataset. DELNOENQ will only allow the
      deletion of uncataloged datasets.
 (2)  Ensure that the dataset to be deleted is not in use on any other
      MVS system. DELNOENQ cannot verify the usage of a dataset on
      an external MVS system, but will attempt serialization as follows:

      (a) A RESERVE is issued to the VTOC of the DASD volume on which th
          dataset resides.
      (b) An enqueue is issued to the major name of 'DELNOENQ' with a
          minor name constructed of the DASD volume serial and dataset
          name.

 (3)  DELNOENQ can be run non-authorized, but it will be without the
      bypass SYSDSN enqueue facility.

 (4)  DELNOENQ will not delete a dataset if there is a cataloged version
      on an SMS Volume. SMS would intercept the SCRATCH request and
      deleted the cataloged version instead of the intended uncataloged
      dataset.

 Example JCL:

 //DELDSNS  EXEC PGM=DELNOENQ
 //STEPLIB   DD DISP=SHR,DSN=your.apf.load.library
 //SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*
 //SYSIN     DD *
    DSN=SYS1.LINKLIB,VOL=OLDRES
    DSN=SYS1.ISP.SISPLOAD,VOL=OLDISP

 Messages

 The following messages can be issued by DELNOENQ and are written to
 the SYSPRINT DDName.

 NONQ001E  Syntax error in input card - Return Code set to 12

     There is a syntax error in the SYSIN card. Check that both the
     DSN and VOL keywords are specified. This card is ignored and
     processing continues to the next SYSIN card.

 NONQ002E  Volume vvvvvv not found - Return Code set to 12

     The DASD volume 'vvvvvv' is not online to the MVS system.
     This card is ignored and processing continues to the next
     SYSIN card.

 NONQ003I  Dataset scratched from volume RC(00)

     The dataset identified by message SSCR005I has been successfully
     deleted.

 NONQ004E  Dataset not scratched RC(xx) RSN(yyyyyyyy) - Check DFP
           Diagnosis Reference.

     An error occurred in SCRATCH processing.
     SCRATCH returned 'xx' and the return code and 'yyyyyyyy' as the
     reason code.
     Check the DFSMSdfp Diagnosis manual for an explanation of the
     error.

 NONQ005I  Dataset Name : dddddddd

     Informational message produced to indicate that DELNOENQ is
     processing dataset 'dddddddd'.

 NONQ006I  Volume Serial : vvvvvv

     Informational message produced to indicate that DELNOENQ is using
     volser 'vvvvvv' for the dataset identified in the previous SSCR005I
     message.

 NONQ007W  DELNOENQ is NOT APF Authorized

     Warning that the DELNOENQ is not running APF authorized. The SYSDSN
     enqueue bypass facility is disabled.

 NONQ008I  DELNOENQ is APF Authorized.

     DELNOENQ is running APF authorized. The SYSDSN enqueue bypass
     is available.

 NONQ009E  Dataset not found on volume - Return Code set to 12.

     The dataset identified by message SSCR005I could not be found on
     the DASD volume identified by message SSCR006I.
     This card is ignored and processing continues with the next
     SYSIN card.

 NONQ010E  Dataset specified is cataloged - Return Code set to 12.

     The dataset identified by message SSCR005I has been found to be
     cataloged on DASD volume identified by message SSCR006I. DELNOENQ
     will not delete this dataset and processing continues with the
     next SYSIN card.

 NONQ011E  Cataloged version of the dataset in on SMS volume - Return
           Code set to 12.

     DELNOENQ will not delete a dataset that has a cataloged version on
     an SMS volume.

 NONQ012E  Cannot determine the SMS status of the cataloged version
           of the dataset - Return Code set to 12.

     DELNOENQ has failed in its attempt to test the SMS status of the
     cataloged version of the dataset. In this instance, the uncataloged
     dataset is not deleted.
