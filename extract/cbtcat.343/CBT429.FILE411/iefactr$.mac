 A Sample Step Termination Exit - IEFACTRT
 -----------------------------------------

 Installation of IEFACTRT

 Assemble and link IEFACTRT into SYS1.LPALIB (this is
 normally performed using an SMP/E USERMOD). For further
 information see the MVS Installation Exits manual.

 Usage Notes

 The supplied source processes SMF Type 30 records and produces
 information messages for started tasks and batch jobs. The messages
 are produced in two places :

 JESMSGLG via a WTO instruction
   A one line summary of the jobstep activity including return code,
   CPU times (TCB and SRB), service units, elapsed time,  step and
   procstep names.


 JESYSMSG via a call to IEFYS
   A more detailed summary including all of the information written by
   to the JESMSGLG dataset and a summary of I/O counts for each DDName
   accessed during the jobstep.
