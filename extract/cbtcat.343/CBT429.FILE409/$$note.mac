I have just made the brand new version of MXI (2.2a) available for
download from the SEC Website : www.secltd.co.uk
The major changes in this release are :

(1) Ability to issue operator commands
(2) Ability to change the swappability of any address space
(3) Addition of the JOB() and ASID() keywords to the TCB and CDE
    commands (ie they now work x-memory).
(4) Addition of a security table for authorized commands (required if
    (1) and (2) exist!).
(5) Ability to list online channel paths

I have also changed the packaging of MXI to bring it into line with
the CBT tape.

Regards,
Rob Scott
