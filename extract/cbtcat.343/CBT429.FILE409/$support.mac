Trouble-Shooting Guide for MXI
------------------------------

If MXI is either abending or producing unexpected results, the following
few simple steps could help resolve the problem.

o Ensure that the MXI load library is in a single extent. MXI has two
  VERY large load modules and I have seen strange 0C4 abends occur when
  the load library is in multiple extents.

o Verify that you do not have earlier releases of MXI modules ahead of
  the intended new MXI modules. This is especially critical for
  authorised commands and those that can have authorised and
  non-authorised versions (eg the "DA" command).

o For the authorized commands HSMQ and NET; MXI establishes a E-MCS,
  issues an operator command and parses the response.
  This method is not very elegant and can be subject to system
  performance and the amount of information returned.
  If you do not see any output when using these commands, it could be
  that MXI is 'timing out' in its attempt to read the E-MCS command
  response.
  As supplied, MXI will wait for a maximum of 10 seconds to get a
  response from the operator command and once a response is received it
  will wait a further second for the message buffer to be filled.

  If you want to change these limits you can apply the following zap :

  NAME MXI RDSEMCS
  VER  0466 F1F0           10 seconds wait for response
  REP  0466 F2F0           replace with 20 seconds
  VER  046E F0F1           01 second wait for message buffer fill
  REP  046E F0F3           replace with 03 seconds
  NAME MXITSF RDSEMCS
  VER  0466 F1F0           10 seconds wait for response
  REP  0466 F2F0           replace with 20 seconds
  VER  046E F0F1           01 second wait for message buffer fill
  REP  046E F0F3           replace with 03 seconds
  NAME MXIREXX RDSEMCS
  VER  0466 F1F0           10 seconds wait for response
  REP  0466 F2F0           replace with 20 seconds
  VER  046E F0F1           01 second wait for message buffer fill
  REP  046E F0F3           replace with 03 seconds

  Please note that increasing the message buffer fill time will probably
  suffice for most shops - but will decrease the response time for the
  commands.

o If the problem occurs online, try running it in batch mode.
  If this also fails, it is a good chance that there is a problem in
  the MXI code.

o If MXI abends, please send me the SYSUDUMP output (in EBCDIC binary
  if possible) and I will attempt to fix the problem as soon as I can.

Please remember that I can only support MXI in my free time and as
proper work allows, so occassionally resolution of a problem may take
a few days (or weeks!) ro resolve.

o When reporting problems, it helps a lot if you mention the release
  of MVS, JES and DFSMS and if you are running RACF and RMF.

o MXI sometimes uses undocumented/unsupported methods to get some of
  ist information. It is possible that the source of this information
  is liable to change by IBM without warning (the most common
  consequence of this is an 0C4 abend). I try to keep this sort of
  code to a minimum, but sometimes IBM leave me with no choice....
