Known Limitations
=================

(1) MXI is written and assembled on OS/390 2.8. it should work on all
    releases of MVS from 5.2 upwards. However, I do not have access to
    every single release of MVS so I cannot guarantee that all commands
    will function on your system.
(2) The MEM command does not scroll backwards from the initial
    passed address (i.e. giving a negative offset).
(3) Certain major nodes (ADJCP for example) do not expand any
    further under the NET command. I have frozen the NET command in its
    current state as the method used is "ropey" at best.
(4) The control block mapping on the MEM command is generated from
    an OS/390 2.8 system.
(5) The DA command does not (and will never) get information from
    the JES2 Spool. It is too much of a headache to implement this
    code with the 'moveable' control block structure of JES2.
