Instructions on how to install MXI from this dataset
----------------------------------------------------

Step 1.  Ensure that you have downloaded the MXI load library as well
         as this file.

Step 2.  Run the $INSTJCL JCL from this dataset to allocate and
         populate the required runtime datasets.

Step 3.  By now you should have *THREE* datasets :
         (o) The MXI load library with 5 members
         (o) The MXI panel dataset with 79 members
         (o) The MXI table dataset with 1 member

Step 4.  Place the MXI panels dataset in your ISPPLIB concatenation.

Step 5.  Place the MXI tables dataset in your ISPTLIB concatenation.

Step 6.  Make the MXI load library available.
         You can do this in one or two ways :

         (a)  Run MXI as authorised (Preferred)
              To take full advantage of all MXI functions, perform the
              following :
              o  Add the MXI load library to the MVS Linklist
              o  Add MXITSF to AUTHTSF section in IKJTSOxx

         (b)  Run MXI non-authorised
              o  Add the MXI load library to your ISPLLIB or STEPLIB
                 concatenation.

Step 7.  Add MXI as an ISPF panel choice.

         Edit your ISR@PRIM panel to include the following two lines :
         (a) In the )BODY section :

             M   MXI    MVS Extended Information

         (b) In the )PROC section within the ZSEL logic :

             M,'PGM(MXI) NEWAPPL(MXI) PASSLIB'
    	
	
Step 8.  Customise the exception rules table (optional)

         See the $MXIXPT member in this dataset for further
         instructions.
	
Step 9.  Customise the security rules table (optional)

         This step only applies if you are running MXI in authorised
         mode.
         See the $MXISEC member in this dataset for further
         instructions.
	

Notes
(1)      The splitting of the INSTLIB dataset into a PANELS and a TABLES
         dataset is optional. You could opt to just allocate the INSTLIB
         dataset to ISPPLIB and also ISPTLIB. This could speed up the
         installation process - but SEC reccommend that separate
         datasets are used because the INSTLIB dataset contains members
         that are not prefixed 'MXI' and could clash against other
         software.
