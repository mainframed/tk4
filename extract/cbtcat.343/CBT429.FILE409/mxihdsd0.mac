!Examples

+ @DASD U=08*                 + List all DASD units in the range 0800-08
+ @DASD * SGRP(PROD*)         + List all volumes in the SMS Storage Grou
+ @DASD ONLY(STO)             + List all volumes mounted STORAGE
+ @DASD * ONLY(SMS) NOT(ALLOC)+ List all SMS volumes that are not alloca
+                             + an address space.

+When more than one online DASD volume matches the specified pattern mas
+summary list of volumes is displayed.
