Sir:

I have modified some code which may be of interest to you or
others.  Whenever I'm on the computer, I generally have an email
session going (either work or home). Sometimes my tasks do not
require mainframe access.

Rather than continually logging on/swapping to a mainframe
session, I modified a copy of the NASPA MVS-LIB COMPCODE program to
optionally do e-mail notifications. This COMPCODE program is in
production jobs, started tasks, as well as batch work that is
important enough for me to know about if a problem occurs.

Another neat feature is when I go out of town, I make a simple
update to the notify dataset for the person who will be handling
the problems in my absence. Since all my jobs & STC's have this
notify step, one simple update is immediately in effect for
everything.

I also made the code Y2K friendly, and changed it to print out the
steps real termination code, not just the highest recorded in the
JCT.  This code is currently running on OS/390 V2R5 without any
problems. The email portion uses IBM's MVS SMTP as the interface to
the corporate email system. The COMPCODE program must be modified for
your installation. Anyway, use it if you like.

If you need any more information, please let me know.
