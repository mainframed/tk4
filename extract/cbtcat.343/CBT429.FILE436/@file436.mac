//***FILE 436 from Glenn Jones of Aramco in Saudi Arabia, and       *
//*           contains a version of the COMPCODE program, which     *
//*           notifies users of completion code information for     *
//*           jobs.  This version has been modified to even send    *
//*           emails to notify a user located elsewhere, of a job   *
//*           completion on the MVS system.                         *
//*                                                                 *

//*                                                                 *
//*      I have modified some code which may be of interest to      *
//*      you or others.  Whenever I'm on the computer, I            *
//*      generally have an email session going (either work or      *
//*      home). Sometimes my tasks do not require mainframe         *
//*      access.                                                    *
//*                                                                 *
//*      Rather than continually logging on/swapping to a           *
//*      mainframe session, I modified a copy of the public         *
//*      COMPCODE program to optionally do e-mail notifications.    *
//*      This COMPCODE program is in production jobs, started       *
//*      tasks, as well as batch work that is important enough      *
//*      for me to know about if a problem occurs.                  *
//*                                                                 *
//*      Another neat feature is when I go out of town, I make a    *
//*      simple update to the notify dataset for the person who     *
//*      will be handling the problems in my absence. Since all     *
//*      my jobs & STC's have this notify step, one simple          *
//*      update is immediately in effect for everything.            *
//*                                                                 *
//*      I also made the code Y2K friendly, and changed it to       *
//*      print out the steps real termination code, not just the    *
//*      highest recorded in the JCT.  This code is currently       *
//*      running on OS/390 V2R5 without any problems. The email     *
//*      portion uses IBM's MVS SMTP, and the program requires      *
//*      simple modifications for use at your installation.         *
//*                                                                 *
