)S  SUBCOMMANDS:
         THE COMPRESS COMMAND IS USED TO COMPRESS A PARTITIONED DATA
         SET ON AN ONLINE DIRECT ACCESS DEVICE AND HAS NO SUBCOMMANDS.

)F  FUNCTION:
         THE COMPRESS COMMAND IS USED TO COMPRESS A PDS IN TWO STEPS.
         FIRST THE PDS IS COPIED FOR BACK-UP. THEN THE PDS IS
         COMPRESSED IN PLACE.

         THE GENERATED NAME OF THE SAFETY DATASET IS DISPLAYED
         PRIOR TO THE SAFETY COPY. THE BACK-UP DATASET WILL BE
         SAVED IN CASE OF AND ERROR IN COMPRESS.

         THE COMPRESS COMMAND CAN BE RUN IN BATCH MODE UNDER THE
         TSO TERMINAL MONITOR PROGRAM. IN THAT CASE ALL MESSAGE
         OUTPUT DIRECTED TO THE TERMINAL (PRINT(*)) WILL BE SENT
         TO THE SYSOUT CLASS SPECIFIED IN THE MSGCLASS PARAMETER
         OF YOUR JOB CARD.

)X  SYNTAX:
         COMPRESS 'PDSNAME' PRINT('DSNAME'/*)/NOPRINT SAFETY/NOSAFETY
                            OLD/SHR RESERVE/NORESERVE
                            UNIT('UNITNAME') VOL('VOLSER')
         REQUIRED - 'PDSNAME'
         DEFAULTS -  PRINT(*)  (COMPRESS LISTING AT TERMINAL)
                (THIS IS CHANGED TO NOPRINT IF RESERVE IS SPECIFIED)
                (IF RUN IN BACKGROUND, COMPRESS WILL DIRECT THIS OUTPUT
                 TO YOUR JOB CARD MSGCLASS)
                  -  SAFETY    (CREATE BACK-UP COPY)
                  -  SHR       (ALLOCATE DATA SET IN SHARE MODE)
                  -  NORESERVE (DO NOT ISSUE HARDWARE RESERVE)
                  -  UNIT(DISK) ALL-INCLUSIVE DEFAULT UNIT TYPE

         NOTES    - IF RESERVE IS SPECIFIED, EITHER THE DEFAULT
                    PRINT OPTION OR AN EXPLICIT REQUEST TO ROUTE
                    THE PRINT TO THE TERMINAL, IS OVERRIDDEN AND
                    THE NOPRINT OPTION IS USED. THIS IS TO PREVENT
                    A RESERVE LOCKOUT SHOULD THE USER WALK AWAY
                    FROM THE TERMINAL WITHOUT COMPLETELY LISTING THE
                    COPY MESSAGES.

                    IF RUN IN BACKGROUND, PRINT(*) WILL DIRECT IEBCOPY
                    MESSAGES TO YOUR MESSAGE CLASS REGARDLESS OF
                    WHETHER RESERVE IS SPECIFIED OR NOT.

                  - THE SAFETY DATA SET CREATED BY THE COMPRESS
                    COMMAND HAS THE FOLLOWING FORMAT:

                       PREFIX.SYSXXXXX.TYYYYYYY.SAFETY

                    WHERE:
                      USERID   = YOUR TSO PROFILE PREFIX VALUE
                      XXXXX    = THE CURRENT JULIAN DATE
                      YYYYYYY  = THE CURRENT TIME OF DAY

         NOTE: IF RUN IN BACKGROUND MODE, A PREFIX SET BY YOUR
               INSTALLATION WILL BE FORCED REGARDLESS OF WHETHER
               OR NOT A "PROFILE PREFIX" COMMAND IS ENTERED INTO
               THE INPUT STREAM.

)O  OPERANDS:
))PDSNAME           - THE NAME OF THE PDS TO BE COMPRESSED.
))PRINT
         ('DSNAME') - SUPPLY THE NAME OF A DATA SET USED TO STORE
                      THE SYSPRINT LISTING FROM THE COMPRESS.

         (*)        - THE SYSPRINT LISTING FROM IEBCOPY WILL BE
                      SENT TO THE TERMINAL. IN BACKGROUND MODE,
                      THE SYSPRINT LISTING WILL BE DIRECTED TO
                      THE SYSOUT CLASS SPECIFIED IN THE "MSGCLASS"
                      PARAMETER OF YOUR JOB CARD.

         NOPRINT    - SUPPRESS THE SYSPRINT COMPRESS LISTING
                      COMPELETELY.

))SAFETY            - REQUESTS THAT A "SAFETY" COPY BE MADE OF THE
                      PDS TO BE COMPRESSED BEFORE COMPRESS IS
                      ATTEMPED.

))NOSAFETY          - REQUESTS THAT NO "SAFETY" DATA SET BE MADE.

))OLD               - THE DATA SET TO BE COMPRESSED SHOULD BE
                      ALLOCATED WITH A DISPOSITION OF "OLD". THIS
                      OPERAND SHOULD BE SPECIFIED IF DATA INTEGRITY
                      IS A PROBLEM WITH THIS DATA SET. THE USER WILL
                      GAIN EXCLUSIVE CONTROL OF THE DATA SET IF
                      IT IS NOT ALREADY IN USE.

))SHR               - THE DATA SET TO BE COMPRESSED WILL BE
                      ALLOCATED WITH A DISPOSITION OF "SHR".
                      OTHER USERS WILL BE ABLE TO USE THIS DATA SET
                      DURING THE COMPRESS. THIS PARAMETER IS THE
                      DEFAULT, AND SHOULD BE USED IF DATA INTEGRITY
                      IS NOT A PROBLEM WITH THE DATA SET BEING
                      COMPRESSED (I.E. IT IS YOUR OWN TSO DATA SET).

))RESERVE            - A HARDWARE RESERVE WILL BE ISSUED AGAINST THE
                       VOLUME CONTAINING THE DATA SET TO BE COMPRESSED.
                       THIS PARAMETER SHOULD ONLY BE USED IN CASES
                       WHERE DATA INTEGRITY IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT
                       DUE TO THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ENQUEUE LOCKOUT
                       OCCURING. THE ENTIRE VOLUME IS LOCKED OUT
                       FROM ACCESS BY OTHER USERS DURING THE COMPRESS
                       CYCLE WHEN THIS PARAMETER IS SPECIFIED.

                     - NOTE THAT WHEN THIS PARAMETER IS SPECIFIED,
                       THE PRINT OPTION IS CHANGED TO NOPRINT IF
                       IT WAS DIRECTED TO THE TERMINAL. THIS IS TO
                       PREVENT LOCKOUTS SHOULD A USER WALK AWAY FROM
                       THE TERMINAL AND LEAVE THE OUTPUT INCOMPLETE.

                     - THIS PARAMETER IS MEANINGLESS IN A NON-SHARED
                       DASD ENVIRONMENT. THE "OLD" PARAMETER SHOULD
                       BE USED TO PREVENT OTHER USERS FROM UPDATING
                       YOUR DATASET IN SUCH AN ENVIRONMENT.

))NORESERVE          - NO HARDWARE RESERVE WILL BE ISSUED AGAINST
                       THE VOLUME CONTAINING THE DATA SET TO BE
                       COMPRESSED. THIS IS THE DEFAULT AND SHOULD
                       BE USED IN MOST ALL CASES OF PDS COMPRESSION
                       DUE TO THE PROBLEMS OF ENQUEUE LOCKOUT.

))UNIT('UNITNAME')   - THE GENERIC DEVICE TYPE OF THE VOLUME ON
                       WHICH THE PDS TO BE COMPRESSED RESIDES. AN
                       ESOTERIC NAME OR GENERIC NAME CAN BE SPECIFIED
                       AS WELL AS A UNIT ADDRESS. THE DEFAULT IS
                       THE ALL-INCLUSIVE NAME "SYSALLDA".

))VOLUME('VOLSER')   - THE NAME OF THE VOLUME ON WHICH THE PDS TO BE
                       COMPRESSED RESIDES. THIS KEYWORD IS USEFUL IF
                       THE DATA SET RESIDES ON A VOLUME DIFFERENT FROM
                       THAT INDICATED IN THE CATALOG. THERE IS NO
                       DEFAULT, AND IF YOU WISH TO USE THE CATALOG
                       ENTRY OMIT THIS KEYWORD WHEN YOU INVOKE THE
                       COMPRESS COMMAND.
