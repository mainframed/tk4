  Hi Sam,

  I'm Tetsuya Kimura.

  I received an e-mail request from from Sam Knutson.
   and am hoping to contribute my program to the CBTTAPE.

  For starters, I am sending a program which
   restores a deleted member from a partitioned data set,
     using a restoration utility.

  I will send other programs soon too.
