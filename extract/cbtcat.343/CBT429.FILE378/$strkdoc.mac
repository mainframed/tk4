                           SORTTRAK

                    DFSORT Tuning Reporter


SORTTRAK is reading the SMF records Type 16 - DFSORT Statistics.

Record type 16 is written to record information about events and
operations of the DFSORT program.

Depending on the option specified at initialization (and whether
DFSORT run successfully), a short record, full record, or no record
is produced.

Some information in the SMF record will not be provided for certain
types of abnormal endings.

SORTRAK is performing the following functions:

1. Read SMF records.
2. Eliminate non-Type 16 records.
3. Process records Type 16.
4. Produce a report.

The SORTTRAK report contains the following information:

  1.   Jobname.
  2.   Stepname and step sequence number.
  3.   Performance Group Number.
  4.   DFSORT started processing: date and time.
  5.   Sort CPU time used in hundredths of a second.
  6.   Type of operation performed: Sort, Merge, Copy
  7.   Method of sorting used: Hiperspace, Dataspace, Work Dataset.
  8.   Was sorting completed in memory (work data sets were not
       needed) ?
  9.   Were the sort work tracks dynamically allocated?
 10.   Was Cache Fast Write used ?
 11.   Final number of extents.
 12.   Final number of Sortwork data set tracks allocated.
 13.   Total number of Sortwork data set tracks used (watch the
       difference!).









The following JCL should be used to run the SORTTRAK:

//yourjob JOB (your,acc),'yourname',MSGCLASS=T,CLASS=A
//SORTTRAK EXEC PGM=SORTTRAK
//STEPLIB  DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=your.loadlib
//SMFDATA  DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=your.smf.input.dataset
//PRINTOUT DD  SYSOUT=*
//REPORT   DD  SYSOUT=K

In our environment the following procedure is recommended:

1. Allocate the SMF disk file on DEV side.

   The required DCB parms are:

2. Run the SMF extract job.
   This job will extract the SMF records Type 16 from the SMF tapes.


   For the PROD SMF data submit the job SMFPROD on PROD side.
   This job will use the SUCKSPIT facility to transfer SMF GDG

3. Analyze the output from the extract job; check the number of
   extracted SMF records type 16.

4. Run the SORTTRAK job.


Good luck!
