      The options available in the%Tutorial Print+option are listed
      below.

        %o+ Tutorials can be printed from either a concatenation of up
            to four libraries with standard SPF library names, or a
            single panel library with a non-standard SPF library name.

        %o+ You must specify the "top" tutorial panel from which to
            start.  All tutorial panels "under" that top panel are then
            printed.

        %o+ You may specify the destination of the output, whether or
            not that printer is a Xerox 2700 Laser printer and whether
            or not lower case letters should be raised to upper case.


      Should any tutorial not answer questions you may have, call Chris
   Gerken at 966-6277 or 965-6277 (EXCOM).
