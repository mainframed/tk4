     ISPF commands are provided for commonly used functions.
     You are able to enter a command in one of two ways...

          1)  By entering the command on the command line
              (usually the top line of the display)

          2)  By hitting a program function (PF) key

     When hitting a Pfkey, the commands represented by that Pfkey are
     "inserted" before any data on the current command line.  For exampl
     if the command list has the word 'STATUS' on it and you hit a Pfkey
     that is set to the word TSO, ISPF will view the command line as
     'TSO STATUS'.

   The following topic will be presented only if selected by number:
