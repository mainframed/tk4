     ISPF has the capability of invoking 2 sessions (split screens). Thi
     command allows the user to put his current half of a split screen
     into a HOLD status and invoke ISPF from the Primary Option panel.

     You can think of the HOLD command as invoking ISPF recursively.

     When you exit the new level of the Primary Option panel (=X), you
     will return with function you had been executing.

     The command may be entered with an ISPF option. For example, 'hold
     6' will bring you to a fresh TSO screen. When you type '=X', you
     will return to your current function.

     The HOLD command has no abbreviations or aliases.
