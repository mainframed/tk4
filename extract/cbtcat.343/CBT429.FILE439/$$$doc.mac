        PDSX - PARTITIONED DATASET MEMBER CROSS - REFERENCE
        ---------------------------------------------------

1. WHAT IS PDSX?
      WITH PDSX YOU CAN FIND OUT WHICH DATASET(S) ON YOUR
      SYSTEM CONTAIN A GIVEN MEMBER.
      UNDER TSO YOU SIMPLY ENTER
         PDSX <MEMBERNAME>
      AND YOU WILL BE SHOWN A LIST OF ALL APPLICABLE
      DATASETS, FROM WHERE YOU CAN DIRECTLY EDIT OR BROWSE
      THE REQUESTED MEMBER(S).

2. HOW DOES IT WORK?
      EVERY NIGHT WE RUN A VTOC SCAN ON ALL OUR DISK PACKS
      (WE DO THIS ANYWAY FOR RECOVERY PURPOSES, SO THERE IS NO
       EXTRA OVERHEAD). WE USE THE VTOC PROGRAM FROM THE CBT TAPE
       FOR THIS.
       THEN WE FILTER THE VTOC OUTPUT TO CREATE A LIST OF ALL
       DESIRED PO / PDSE - DATASETS.
       THE DIRECTORIES OF THESE DATASETS ARE READ, THE RESULT IS
       SORTED AND LOADED INTO A VSAM KSDS.
       THE DIRECTORY SCAN TAKES ABOUT 15 MIN ELAPSED TIME AND
       ABOUT 1.5 CPU MINUTES FOR ABOUT 4,500 DATASETS AND
       600,000 MEMBERS.

3. INSTALLATION

   COPY THE LOAD MODULES PDSMEM1 AND PDSMEM4 TO A LOAD
   LIBRARY OR RECOMPILE THEM.

   3.1 THE BATCH PART
       MODIFY THE SAMPLE JOB IN MEMBER $BATCH TO MEET YOUR
       STANDARDS.
       MODIFY THE VTOCFLTR EXEC TO EXCLUDE FILE NOT WANTED
       IN YOUR XREF (I.E. ISPF PROFILES, CONFIDENTIAL FILES...)
       PLAN TO RUN THE JOB ON A REGULAR BASIS.

   3.2 ONLINE
       COPY THE PANELS(PDSMEM2A,PDSMEM2B,PDSHLP2A) TO A PANEL
       LIBRARY.
       COPY THE REXX EXEC "PDSX" TO YOUR SYSPROC/SYSEXEC FILE
       AND MODIFY THE LIBDEF STATEMENT TO POINT TO YOUR
       PANEL LIBRARY.

4. KNOWN PROBLEMS
   PO DATASETS ARE OPENED EVERY NIGHT BY PDSX TO SCAN THEIR
   DIRECTORIES. THIS CAUSES THEIR LAST REFERENCE DATE TO BE
   CHANGED.
   IF YOU USE HSM, HSM WILL NEVER CONSIDER THESE DATASETS FOR
   MIGRATION, BECAUSE THEY SEEM TO HAVE BEEN ACCESSED RECENTLY.
   FOR US THIS IS NOT A PROBLEM, BECAUSE WE DO NOT INDEX USER
   LIBRARIES, AND PRODUCTION/SYSTEM LIBRARIES ARE NOT CONSIDERED
   MIGRATION CANDIDATES BY OUR SHOP.
   POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS COULD BE
      - TO DO A "QUIET" OPEN ON THE DATASET, I KNOW SOME
        DISK MANAGEMENT TOOLS OPEN FILE WITHOUT CHANGING THE
        LAST REFERENCE DATE, OR
      - LOOK AT THE LAST REFERENCE DATE FOR A DATASET BEFORE
        READING ITS DIRECTORY. IF IT HAS NOT BEEN CHANGED,
        THE DIRECTORY INFORMATION COLLECTED DURING THE PREVIOUS
        RUN CAN SIMPLY BE COPIED FROM THE EXISTING XREF - DATASET.
        BUT THIS WOULD REQUIRE A LITTLE BIT OF LOGIC TO BE ADDED

   SOMETIMES I HEAR PEOPLE COMPLAIN THAT THEY DON'T SEE A MEMBER
   THAT THEY KNOW IT EXISTS. THIS IS BECAUSE YOU CANNOT EXPECT
   PDSX TO KNOW ABOUT MEMBERS CREATED AFTER IT HAS BEEN RUN.
   THE SAME IS TRUE FOR DELETED MEMBERS.

5. ENHANCEMENTS
   WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO DO (IF I HAD THE TIME) :

   - FIX THE HSM PROBLEM ABOVE
   - ADD RACF SUPPORT TO SHOW ONLY DATASETS ACCESSIBLE TO
     A USER
   - SWITCH FROM VTOC SCANS TO DCOLLECT. THIS WOULD MAKE
     IT POSSIBLE TO KEEP DIRECTORY INFORMATION FOR MIGRATED
     AND / OR BACKED UP DATASETS.
   - ABILITY TO DO A PARTIAL INDEX REFRESH (FOR SELECTED
     DATASETS OR VOLUMES)
