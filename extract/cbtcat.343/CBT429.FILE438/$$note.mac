I'll be happy to send along all the macros that I've written, but
first a few caveats:

1.  I am the only person that has made much use of the macros.  I
    know of no problems with them, but I use them within my own
    knowledge of what they do and how they work. As we pass them on
    to others for evaluation, I would guess that they are somewhere
    around the 'alpha test' level.  I have coded error MNOTE
    statements for some of the things that can be done wrong, but
    I'm sure I haven't guessed at all the things that can be done
    wrong.

2.  There are two different levels of base register-subroutine call
    macros that are incompatible with each other.  A given program
    must be coded with one or the other.  I wrote the first version
    in about 1974, and the second in 1993.
