  Purpose :    Automatic JCL generation to cumulate all days IMS log
  =========    data-set(s) into a one month data-set.

  Functional Summary :
  ====================

         The JCL skeleton, used for JOB generation, is obtained from
    a member named IMSLOGnn (default for nn is 00), and located in a
    predefined partitioned data-set (with LRECL=80 and declared at the
    assembly step with SYSPARM).

         Various members IMSLOGnn (JCL skeletons) can be build as you
    want to generate different jobs, assuming they are all based on
    IMS log data-set(s) manipulation (normal JCL statements cards).
    The first JCL statement supplied must be a JOB card, which will
    be used by submit when started task running. Some other cards are
    explained below :
         1. Cards starting with three asterisks (columns 1-3 = ***)
            are considered as private comment cards (never copied or
            submited).
         2. Special cards starting (columns 1-2) with a question mark
            followed by an indicator character are control processing
            oriented.
            Positional control only :
            ?I = is mandatory and indicate where the eventual TYPRUN=
                 parameter card can be inserted in the JOB statement.
            ?0 = is mandatory and indicate where starts the normal JCL
                 skeleton (when not started task). Generally this is
                 placed after the JOB statement.
            Substitution values definition :
            ?1 = is mandatory and defines the IMS day's log data-set(s)
                 level name (this is the level to search the day's
                 data-set(s) in the catalog).
            ?2 = is optional and defines the IMS month log data-set
                 level name (this is the level to create the month's
                 data-set).
            Then ?1... and ?2... coding are used to indicate where
            substitution must be done in the JCL skeleton.

  How to invoke it :
  ==================
      1. As console START command :
              S IMSLOG,D=YYDDD,J=XX,O=COPY
                                      SCAN
         where IMSLOG may be, I.E., the following procedure :
              //IMSLOG  PROC D=,J=,O=
              //IMSLOG  EXEC PGM=IMSLDS,PARM='DAY=&D,JCL=&J,&O'
                                     or PARM='D=&D,J=&J,&O'
      2. As batch EXEC procedure :
              //... EXEC IMSLOG,D=YYDDD,J=XX
      3. As batch EXEC :
              //... EXEC PGM=IMSLDS,PARM='DAY=YYDDD,JCL=XX'
                                 or PARM='D=YYDDD,J=XX'
      4. As TSO call :
              CALL '...DSNAME...(IMSLDS)' 'DAY=YYDDD,JCL=XX'
                                       or 'D=YYDDD,J=XX'
      5. As TSO command or sub-command :
              IMSLDS ... (for syntax description see below) ...

  where : - YYDDD is the desired serial day date selection (if not
  -------   specified, yesterday date is used).
          - JCL=XX (or JOB=/J=) is the two characters suffix to form
            the member name IMSLOG.. (default is 00).
          - COPY/SCAN (or C/S) are JCL submit options (job TYPRUN).

  Notes : 1. Only when running as system task (through operator START
  =======    command), the COPY or SCAN options are accepted and all
             generated JCL statements are immediately SUBMIT to JES2.
          2. Otherwise (batch or TSO running), the generated JCL is
             always stored in a new (created) data-set named as
             follows : '#0.GENJCL.D#1.T#2'
             where : #0 = current RACF User-id
                     #1 = YYDDD (current day)
                     #2 = HHMMSS (current time of day)
             You may then submit it, if you want.

  TSO command or sub-command syntax :
  ===================================
         IMSLDS  DAY(DD/MM/YY)  JCL(XX)  OPTION
                 alias : D(DD/MM/YY)  JOB(XX)
                                      J(XX)
         IMSLDS  FROM(DD/MM/YY)  TO(DD/MM/YY)  JCL(XX)  OPTION
                 alias : F(DD/MM/YY)  T(DD/MM/YY)  JOB(XX)
                                                   J(XX)

  where : DAY(DD/MM/YY) indicate a particular date selection, if
  -------      not specified it means yesterday date.
          FROM(DD/MM/YY) and TO(DD/MM/YY) indicate a range of dates
               (respectively the starting and ending date), which
               must fall in the same month.
               If the ending date is not supplied it means the end
               of the starting date month or the yesterday date when
               this is lower.
          JCL(XX) is the two characters suffix to form the member name
               IMSLOG.. (default is 00).
          OPTION may one of the following keywords :
                    MSG or LIST (alias M or L)
               or : NOMSG or NOLIST (alias N)
               which allows you to accept/suppress all messages.
  Remarks : 1. A IMSLDS command with FROM and TO identical dates is
  --------     like IMSLDS DAY(DD/MM/YY) command.
            2. A IMSLDS command with only the FROM(DD/MM/YY) date
               which matches the last day of the month is also like
               a IMSLDS DAY(DD/MM/YY) command.

  Completion codes :     0 = normal termination.
  ==================    16 = a severe error has been detected.

  TSO CLIST :  When running in a TSO CLIST environment, a variable
  ===========  named EUGENDS will contain the name of the generated
               JCL data-set.
