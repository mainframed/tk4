  AUTHOR : DAVID B. COLE. Note my apologies for the lack of commentary.
           When I first wrote this program, it was a quick-and-dirty
           one intended to solve only a very specific problem that I
           was having at the time. Ever since HOWARD GILBERT let this
           program out into the world, I have been "intending" to clean
           it up. Well, I haven't done that yet (how many years has it
           been now?), but I do, from time to time, make miscellaneous
           functional enhancements, and from now on I will at least be
           documenting those.

              - I have added commentary describing how to use CMPRSEQ.
              - I am changing the way in which the ignore file is
                processed. Normally, when a card from the ignore file
                is matched within a missmatched block, the fact that
                the ignored card is matched does not terminate the
                missmatched block. This is still true; however, once
                the extent of a missmatched block has been determined,
                then that block is rescanned for ignored matches that
                are equidistant into the block from one end or the
                other. if any are found, then the missmatched block
                is segmented into smaller missmatched blocks.
              - The SYSPRINT, NEWLIST, and OLDLIST datasets will now
                support any RECFM, LRECL, and BLKSIZE. Note, for
                complete messages, the minimum data length should be
                133 bytes.

                                                      CMPRSEQ   2/4.

  DESCRIPTION : The CMPRSEQ program compares two sequential card image
         files and reports precisely the differences between the two.
         Such differences can consist of insertions, deletions, and
         replacements (of either equal or unequal sizes).
         CMPRSEQ accomplishes this by reading the two input files
         alternately and comparing the card images as it goes along.
         When it encounters two cards that mismatch, it saves them and
         continues to read the two files alternately. Each time it
         reads a card from one file, it compares it to all cards that
         it has read from the other file since the start of the
         mismatch. If no match is found, then it saves that card and
         proceeds to read the next card from the other file. CMPRSEQ
         continues alternating back and forth in this manner until it
         has read a card that does match one of the saved cards from
         the other file. The mismatch then consists of all cards in
         the two saved stacks that are below the two matching cards.
         The mismatched cards are dumped out to logging datasets, and
         then CMPRSEQ proceeds to look for the next mismatched block.

  LIMITATIONS : CMPRSEQ will compare only card image files, i.e.,files
         having fixed length records that are 80 bytes long.
         CMPRSEQ will compare only one pair of files per invocation.
         It will not compare an entire PDS library, although it will
         compare a JCL selected PDS library member.
         If an insertion block (for example) contains a card whose
         duplicate already appears commonly throughout the files being
         compared (e.g., the "SPACE 1" assembler language statement,
         etc.), then the comparison may become, to a greater or lesser
         degree, desynchronized due to the inserted card finding a
         match with a pre-existing copy of that card in the other file.
         CMPRSEQ provides mechanisms to help deal with sybchronization
         problems (note, synchronization problems can occur, not just
         with inserted blocks, but also with deleted blocks and with
         replaced blocks).

  JCL - EXEC CARD KEYWORD : REGION=
         CMPRSEQ's memory requirements vary according to the aggregate
         size of the largest pair of mismatched blocks encountered. If
         a memory shortage occurs, then CMPRSEQ terminates immediately;
         consequently, it is best to provide a generous amount of
         available memory. Usually, REGION=1024K should be enough.

        EXEC CARD KEYWORD : PARM=FULL
         By default CMPRSEQ will compare two cards only in columns 1
         through 72, thus ignoring the sequence number field.
         Specifying PARM=FULL causes CMPRSEQ to examine each card in
         all 80 columns.

        DDNAMEs : OLD and NEW
                  Attributes :
                   Access method   QSAM
                   DSORG           PS
                   RECFM           F or FB
                   LRECL           80
                   BLKSIZE         80*N
                   Defaults        (PS,F,80,80)
         These DDNAMEs (OLD and NEW) must designate the two files to be
         compared. Their existance is required. Usually, one file is an
         updated (newer) version of the other, hence names OLD and NEW.

        DDNAME : SYSPRINT
                 Attributes :
                   Access method   QSAM
                   DSORG           PS
                   RECFM           UA, VA, VBA, FA, or FBA
                   LRECL           133 or LARGER
                   BLKSIZE         133 or LARGER
                   Defaults        (PS,VBA,137,4096)
         The SYSPRINT file is optional. If it is available, then it
         receives a log of all discovered mismatches. For each
         mismatched block, both the OLD and NEW version of that block
         is shown.

        DDNAMEs : OLDLIST and NEWLIST
                  Attributes :
                   Access method   QSAM
                   DSORG           PS
                   RECFM           UA, VA, VBA, FA, or FBA
                   LRECL           133 or LARGER
                   BLKSIZE         133 or LARGER
                   DEFAULTS        (PS,VBA,137,4096)
         Both OLDLIST and NEWLIST are optional. If one (or both) are
         available, then a copy of the OLD (or NEW) file is written to
         it with the locations of all mismatches clearly flagged.

        DDNAME : IGNORE
                 Attributes :
                   Access method   QSAM
                   DSORG           PS
                   RECFM           F or FB
                   LRECL           80
                   BLKSIZE         80*N
                   Defaults        (PS,F,80,80)
         The IGNORE file is optional. If it is available, then it is
         used to help control the possible desynchronization problems
         discussed earlier. The IGNORE file should contain copies of
         card images that appear repeatedly throughout the files being
         compared, and especially appearing in areas affected by
         insertions and deletions. Copies of these cards, when
         encountered during a mismatch resolution process, will not be
         used to resolve the mismatch. By this means the possibility
         of desynchronization can be reduced.

                                                      CMPRSEQ   4/4.

        DDNAME : SYNC
                 Attributes :
                   Access method   QSAM
                   DSORG           PS
                   RECFM           F or FB
                   LRECL           80
                   BLKSIZE         80*N
                   Defaults        (PS,F,80,80)
         Unfortunately, very large files may have too many commonly
         reoccuring cards for the IGNORE file to be wholely effective
         in eliminating desynchronization  problems. If this is the
         case, then the SYNC file can be provided to force
         resynchronization at particular points in the files being
         compared. This file should contain copies of one or more
         cards each of which appears exactly once in both the OLD and
         NEW files. The cards in the SYNC file should appear in the
         same order by which they appear in the OLD and NEW files.
         They should represent points in the OLD and NEW files at which
         you wish to force comparison synchronization. Generally, such
         points will be following those areas where otherwise
         unrecoverable desynchronization has occured. When CMPRSEQ
         encounters a resynchronization point (i.e., when it has read a
         card from one of the comparison files that exactly matches the
         next card from the SYNC file), it will not read any further
         from that file until it reads the identical card from the
         other file. This has the effect of forcing the resolution of
         a current mismatch (if any) at the resynchronization point.
         The SYNC file is optional. If it is available, then it must
         be correctly formed. If it is not (i.e., if it is out of
         sequence, or if it contains a card that does not appear in
         both the OLD and NEW files), then the CMPRSEQ run will fail.

  COMPLETION CODES :
       0 - Processing has completed successfully. No mismatches have
           been found.
       4 - Processing has completed successfully. At least one mismatch
           has been found.
      12 - Processing has failed. A memory shortage has occured.
      16 - Processing has aborted. One of the comparison files (DDNAME
           OLD or NEW) is not available.
