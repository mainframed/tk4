  Purpose :    This module allows the alteration or display of any
  ---------    virtual storage locations in the NUCLEUS, CSA, Address
               Spaces (not swap-out), etc...
               Note : it does'nt replace the INCORZAP program to
                      modify the LPA which is store protected.

  Notes : - VCOREZAP is an authorized users only TSO command.
  ------- - VCOREZAP may be also executed by the console operator
            typing the following START command :
                  S VZAP
            where VZAP is the name of the cataloged procedure which
            contains only an EXEC JCL statement as below :
                  //VZAP  EXEC  PGM=VCOREZAP
          - VCOREZAP now allows the use of dsect's references through
            generated dsects tables stored in a data-set (see program
            GDTUTIL and routine DTUR).

  Virtual Storage commands at disposal :
  --------------------------------------

         D NNNN :
               To display 16 hex bytes starting at location NNNN.
               Just ENTER or type only D to display 16 hex bytes
               starting at the current or +16 address pointer
               (continue the display of data). This pointer is
               updated by any D, S, F and A commands. Enter + or
               - decimal 1 up to 999 to display forward/backward
               from the current location pointer.
               NNNN may be :
               a label (1 to 8 characters),
                 or an hex address (1 to 8 hex digits preceeded by
                    a period, which may be omitted if the first one
                    is a numeric 0-9),
                 or a field-name and a dsect-name (separated by a
                    slash and given in this order, where dsect-name
                    must also exist as label),
               followed by an eventual displacement expressed as +
               or - DDDD (another label or hex value),
                    or a field-name and dsect-name (separated by a
                       slash and given in this order).

         S NNNN HHHH,... or @N :
               To store data bytes (HHHH,...) or the contents of a
               user-area (@N) starting at NNNN location (see at
               previous D NNNN command for how to specify it).
               HHHH are pairs of hex digits separated by blanks or
               commas as desired. @N indicate which user-area to use.
               An * in place of NNNN continue to store in sequence.

         F '...' OR HHHH... :
               To find the next first occurrence of a character
               (1 to 16 characters) or hexadecimal (2 to 32 hex
               digits) string from the current location pointer
               until the next end of page boundary address (4K
               boundary address). Just ENTER or type only F to
               continue the search in the successive 4K.
               FULL keyword : may be specified before or after
                      the search string. It allows to scan the
                      entire address space, starting-ending at
                      the current location pointer.
               NOTE : The last 16 bytes of every 4K page search
                      are never tested for the requested string
                      (they are just displayed with the advice
                      '<--NF'), but they are retained and used
                      with the 4K successive immediate check, so
                      scan over pages boundaries is supplied.

               specified address or displacement value NNNN (see at
               previous D NNNN command for how to specify it).
               If NNNN is omitted, the label LLLL is assigned the
               current address pointer value.

         Z LLLL :
               To delete the specified label LLLL reference.

         L LLLL :

               FFFF HH : a field-name and flag-value (hex).

         Q :   Display how core storage space has grown.

         Q * : Restart the current dsect's data-set.

         Q SSSS :
               Start a new dsect's data-set (SSSS is a data-set name).
               Note : Q * and Q SSSS commands may be used to free all
                      core storage space and start again with the same
                      or another dsects tables data-set.
