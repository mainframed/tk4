./     ADD     NAME=AGENDA
./     NUMBER  NEW1=100,INCR=100
)F FUNCTION : the AGENDA command displays all today (by default)
    planned activities or any others as required by a specified date.
    To use this facility, it is mandatory to :
         (1) pre-allocate a sequential data-set with the following
             characteristics :
             DSNAME  - 'User-ID.AGENDA.DATA' User-ID = your USERID
             FORMAT  -  FB               Fixed blocked
             DSORG   -  PS               Physical sequential
             LRECL   -  80               Record length
             BLKSIZE -  9040             Block length
             Note : if you have an already existing data-set named
                    'User-id.AGENDA', don't worry about, it will be
                    correctly handled (but if you want, you may rename
                    your data-set as 'User-id.AGENDA.DATA').
         (2) then, initialize this AGENDA data-set with your planned
             activities (using an EDIT of your choice).
             The records must be formated as below :
             DD/MM/YY..............message....................
             <---  80 bytes long  --- --- --- --- --- --- --->
             Where :
             col 1-2  = DD (2 digits) is the day
             Col 3    = a slash (/), a period (.) or a minus sign (-)
             Col 4-5  = MM (2 digits) is the month
             Col 6    = a slash (/), a period (.) or a minus sign (-)
             Col 7-8  = YY (2 digits) is the year
             Col 9-80 = message (characters - free format)
             Note : an * in col 1 defines a message (col 9-80) to be
                    always displayed.
)X SYNTAX :
         AGENDA    = today message(s) by default
      or AGENDA DD/MM/YY
                   = specified date DD/MM/YY message(s)
      or AGENDA DD/MM/YY DD/MM/YY
                   = specified range of dates message(s)
      or any previous AGENDA command format followed by a last operand
                   User-ID which allows the access to another AGENDA
                   data-set if desired.
         Note : date(s) are also accepted in format DD.MM.YY (period
                used) or DD-MM-YY (minus sign used).
)O OPERAND : none required.
    Remark : the date 00/00/00 means the beginning of the file, and
             the date 99/99/99 means the end of the file.
    Examples : AGENDA 00/00/00 99/99/99 means display the entire file.
               AGENDA 00/00/00 means display from the beginning of the
                      file until today date included.
               AGENDA 99/99/99 means display from the today date until
                      the end of file.
