  FUNCTION : program/command - displays various information about the
  ---------- MVS system you're running on.
             This program runs under ISPF/PDF and displays a lot of
             information that you generally have to get from different
             sources. It uses the BRIF services to display the data,
             which makes it easier to browse through hundreds of
             lines of output. It shows you the following :
                 MVS level, DFP level, OSLVL flags, JES2 level
                 IPL date, time, VOLSER, NUC-ID, CLPA, CVTUSER
                 Product level for : TSO/E, ISPF, DFDSS, HSM,
                                     RACF,  VTAM, (DB2), SORT
                 PPT table list
                 Name and status of the RACF data-sets
                 SMF data : SID, JWT, GRS' SNAME, SYS1.MANx
                 On-line CPU's, processor speed in MIPS
                 On-line storage (real and extended)
                 Virtual storage map (CSA, SQA, LPA, etc)
                 Resource Manager (SRM) parameters and domains
                 OPEN catalogs
                 PAGE data sets in use
                 Name and status of SYS1.DUMP data sets
                 Sub-system vector table with functions processed
                 JES2 data information
                 TCAS data (requires SHOWMVS to run authorized)
                 TSO PARMLIB data
                 Address Space Usage, active Jobs, TSU's, STC's
                 Active LPA queue (MLPA, FLPA)
                 SVC table with name of corresponding LPA module
                 T1, T2, T3 and T6 ESR tables
                 Link-list data sets, with creation date
                 LPA-list data sets, with creation date
                 List of authorized libraries, with creation date
                 Device classes and corresponding unit-names
                 On-line devices, with type, volser, status, owner
                     label type (tapes), SMS storage group
                 System consoles, with status and routcde list
                 LNKLST, LPALST and APFLST lists cross-reference each
                     other to help you keep them up-to-date
                 Device status is refreshed when you hit "enter"
             SHOWMVS also displays some information related to your
             own TSO session :
                   The RACF and TSO profiles
                   The TCB tree and PRB chains
                   Allocated ddnames, with DSN and EXCP count
                   Enhanced view of the JPAQ and load-lists

                                                      SHOWMVS   2/3.

             SHOWMVS can run in batch or as a TSO command and write
             the output to a QSAM data-set instead of displaying the
             data via BRIF (when invoked under ISPF not authorized).
             Normally SHOWMVS output is in lower case, but if you want
             to print it in lower case, you must invoke it as :
                   1. a program and specify PARM=CAPS, or
                   2. a command and specify CAPS operand.
             If a SHOWMVS DD-name data-set is pre-allocated (QSAM DCB
             with REFCM=FBA,LRECL=101), then the output print is always
             written on it.
             When not present, the following action is taken :
             1. in a TSO/ISPF environment, the output is displayed on
                the terminal,
             2. in a TSO only environment (background-job/foreground-
                session) the output is written on a SYSOUT data-set
                in HOLD status class and dynamically allocated,
             3. in a Batch program environment, the output is written
                on a SYSOUT=* data-set dynamically allocated with the
                DD-name SHOWMVS.
             Additional PARM= options or command operands :
             1. DDN(...) to use an alternate DD-name (default name is
                         SHOWMVS).
                         Mandatory : when this keyword is used the FILE
                         =========== must be pre-allocated.
             2. LPG(...) to set the number of Lines per Page (default
                         is 60).
             3. PGN(...) to set the starting Page Number, it's the
                         initial page count (default is 1).
             4. HPG(YES/NO) to have or not have the heading at top of
                         all pages (default is YES).
                         HPG(NO) conflicts with PGN(...).
             Note: each option must be separated from the other by at
                   least a blank or comma.
             Ex. - program EXEC statement:
                         PARM='CAPS,DDN(MYPRINT),LPG(50),PGN(10)'
                   TSO command operands:
                         SHOWMVS CAPS DDN(MYPRINT) LPG(50) PGN(10)
             Also the LINK, ATTACH or LOAD/CALL/DELETE macros
             instructions can be used to invoke SHOWMVS from another
             program/command (be careful to AMODE).
             The format must be as follows :
                     ...  LINK/ATTACH  EP=SHOWMVS,
                                       PARAM=(optaddr),VL=1
                     ...  LOAD  EP=SHOWMVS
                          LR    R15,R0  <--- (*) see Note below
                          CALL  (15),
                                (optaddr),VL=1
                          DELETE  EP=SHOWMVS
             where "optaddr" specifies the address of the option list
                   (equivalent to PARM= parameter of an EXEC statement
                   and must be present).
             (*) Note: after the LOAD bit0 of R0 = AMODE, so may be you
                       must use BASSM / BSM, and bit0 of R1 = AC code.

                                                      SHOWMVS   3/3.

             Typical Parameter List :
                     R1 = address of A(optaddr+X'80000000')
                                  0F'0',H'0'
                     optaddr ---> H'0'
                               or H'4',C'CAPS'
                               or H'25',C'CAPS DDN(MYPRINT) LPG(50)'
