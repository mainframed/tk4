   Function : The STATDS command procedure formats information on any
   ---------- disk data-set. It reads through the entire data-set and
              outputs disk track usage, blocksize and other statistics.

   Syntax :   %STATDS 'DSN' PARM(/NO/LABEL/FULL)
   --------   Required : 'DSN'
              Default : the first value given is the default.
              PARM() : means that all types of characteristics and
                       statistics will be printed.
              ALIAS : none.
              Special : %STATDS 'DSN' PARM('GAS(TT.TT.RR)')
                        or %STATDS 'DSN' PARM('GAS(ALL)')
                        only for partitioned data-set.

   Operands : 'DSN' - name of the data-set to be considered.
   ----------
  PARM(/NO/LABEL/FULL) :
              specifies the amount and the types of information and
              statistics desired.

     PARM() : is the default value. The following information will be
              given :
              A) DCB and DSCB characteristics.
              B) record counts, record size, track usage statistics
                 for any type of data-set organization.
                 For DSORG=IS, the command reads through the entire
                 data-set (there may be up to three separate files of
                 data and reports on each file). Also, the ISAM label
                 (format 2 DSCB) record will be read and a data-set
                 profile which includes data-set reorganization data
                 and data-set characteristics will be provided.
              C) for DSORG=PO, the directory TTR's will be compared
                 against actual disk addresses to determine the TTRs
                 of "GAS" members (the first 72 characters of any
                 "GAS" member are outputed).
                 "GAS" members are the old members which, after a
                 replacement, keep the data blocks. The blocks are
                 freed only by a compress.
                 Statistics are maintained on the size of "GAS" and
                 "REAL" members and the number of ALIAS members. If
                 any ALIASes are in the data-set, a check is made
                 to see that corresponding real entries also exist.
                 The program finds "GAS" members only if the data-set
                 has not been compressed out yet.

                                                      STATDS    2/2.

     PARM(NO) : suppress the "GAS" TTR report.

     PARM(LABEL) : only DCB and DSCB characteristics are reported.

     PARM(FULL) : supply the directory members list (only DSORG=PO).

     PARM('GAS(TT.TT.RR)') : will add a member name to the directory
                 for the "GAS" member having the specified TTR location
                 (in hex, obtained from a previous run). This is
                 usefull if you know which one you want. Any user
                 data that was in the directory entry of a deleted
                 or replaced member cannot be recovered.
     PARM('GAS(ALL)') : allows to recover all "GAS" members in a
                 data-set.
              -- Note about LOAD modules : this program cannot recover
                 a "GAS" LOAD module. It will give it a member name so
                 it wont be compressed out, but the directory entry
                 will not be a LOAD module type. To reconstruct the
                 proper LOAD module directory would require information
                 that is no longer in the partitioned data-set.

   Alternate way of use : the data-set statistics may be also executed
   ---------------------- in a job as showed below.

          JCL statement : //STAT EXEC STATDS,P=...,DSN='...'
          where STATDS is the name of the following procedure :
               //STDS    PROC P=,DSN=
               //STDS    EXEC PGM=STATS,PARM='&P'
               //IN        DD DSN=&DSN,DISP=SHR
               //OUT       DD SYSOUT=*
