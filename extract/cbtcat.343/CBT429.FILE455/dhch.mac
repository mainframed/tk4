./     ADD     NAME=DHC
./     NUMBER  NEW1=100,INCR=100
)F FUNCTION : DHC IS A HEX/DECIMAL CALCULATOR.
              IT IS STRICTLY 'FIXED-POINT' AND IGNORES OVERFLOW
              CONDITIONS.
)X SYNTAX :   DHC WILL ACCEPT JUST ABOUT ANYTHING FOR INPUT.
              OPERATIONS THAT WILL BE ACCEPTED ARE :
                 + FOR ADD
                 - FOR SUBTRACT
                 * FOR MULTIPLY
                 / FOR DIVIDE
              --- EXPONENTIATION IS NOT SUPPORTED ---
              A SEMI-COLON (;) OR A COMMA (,) MAY BE USED TO SEPARATE
              INPUT EQUATIONS OR COMMANDS.
   COMMAND SYNTAX : SYMBOL = VALUE;
                    VALUE;
                    EQUATION;
              E.G. : A=23;126H;33+3233H-323.+7 ARE ALL VALID.
              THE DEFAULT MODE IS DECIMAL.
              ALL HEX VALUES IN DECIMAL MODE MUST BE FOLLOWED BY
              THE CHARACTER 'H'. ALL DECIMAL VALUES IN HEX MODE
              MUST BE FOLLOWED BY THE CHARACTER '.'.
)O OPERANDS AND COMMANDS :
              /SORT   : DISPLAY A SORTED SYMBOLS TABLE
              /LIST   : DISPLAY THE SYMBOLS TABLE
              /HEX    : SET MODE TO HEX
              /DEC    : SET MODE TO DECIMAL
              /DISP   : DISPLAY ALL EQUATIONS AS PROCESSED
              /NODISP : DISPLAY ONLY THE LAST RESULT UNLESS THE INPUT
                        ENDS BY A COMMAND.
              /DELETE : DELETE ONE OR MORE SYMBOLS AND THEIR VALUES
                        FROM THE SYMBOLS TABLE.
   EXAMPLES OF INPUT :
      /HEX;START=0ABBC0;ERROR=0AC000;OFFSET=ERROR-START;/SORT
      NOTE THAT HEX VALUES BEGINNING WITH A CHARACTER MUST BE
      PRECEEDED BY A ZERO TO PREVENT THEIR BEING INTERPRETED AS
      VARIABLES.
   NOTES : 1) SEMI-COLONS (OR COMMAS) SEPARATE EQUATIONS;
           2) DIVISION BY ZERO YIELDS AN ERROR MESSAGE;
           3) 0FFFFFFFFH + 1 YIELDS ZERO.
           4) A PRIMATIVE LOOPING CAPABILITY IS PRESENT,
              IF NEW INPUT IS NOT ENTERED AFTER ANY DISPLAY,
              THE LAST INPUT WILL BE USED.
              EXAMPLE :
               YOU ENTER : A = 3;
               DHC RETURNS :   3 00000003
               YOU ENTER : A = A*3;
               DHC RETURNS :   9 00000009
               YOU ENTER : <CARRIER RETURN OR SHIFT/ENTER>
               DHC RETURNS :  27 0000001B
               ETC...
           5) THE CURRENT RESULT IS KEPT IN THE SYMBOL '*'...
              THIS MEANS THAT TO GET THE CURRENT RESULT TIMES 2
              ONE COULD ENTER **2; TO GET THE CURRENT RESULT TO
              THE THIRD POWER, ONE COULD ENTER *****.
