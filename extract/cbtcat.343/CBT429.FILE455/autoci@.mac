  Purpose :    Issue operators commands (started task or specific
  ---------    background jobs only). When executed in foreground
               region by an authorized TSO user, the program enter
               a special test mode, usefull to debug the operators
               commands sequence process (using terminal TPUT/TGET).

  Invoked by : 1. Console START command :
  ------------      S AUTO,FROM='...PO-dsname...',
                           M=...member-name...

               2. Procedure (authorized job) :
                    //... EXEC AUTO,FROM='...PO-dsname...',
                                    M=...member-name...
                  where AUTO procedure skeleton may be :
                    //AUTO    PROC M=...,FROM='...'
                    //AUTO    EXEC PGM=AUTOCI,PARM='&M'
                    //STEPLIB   DD DSN=...library...,DISP=SHR
                    //SYSPDS    DD DSN=&FROM,DISP=SHR

               3. JCL (authorized job) :
                    //... EXEC PGM=AUTOCI,PARM='...member-name...'
                    //STEPLIB  DD DSN=...library...,DISP=SHR
                    //SYSPDS   DD DSN=...PO-dsname...,DISP=SHR

               4. TSO test mode (authorized user) :
                    ALLOC DA(...PO-dsname...) F(SYSPDS) SHR
                    CALL '...library...(AUTOCI)' '...member-name...'
                                            or : '...member-name.../S'
                    FREE F(SYSPDS)
                  Note : can be a CLIST if desired. '/S' may be added
                         after the member-name to send the operators
                         commands to the operating system.

               5. TSO command or sub-command (authorized user) :
                    AUTOCI ...PO-dsname... ...member-name... T(EST)
                                                             S(YSTEM)
                  Note : option T or TEST is the default, when S or
                         SYSTEM is used, the operators commands are
                         sended to the operating system.

  Parameters field : PARM=...member-name... to supply the initial
  ------------------ operators commands member name.
               ...member-name... may be 1 up to 8 characters long.

  Input data (SYSPDS) : columns 1 to 72 of cards can be used for
  --------------------- operators commands or instructions coding.
               No fixed columns nor continuations are provided.

  Instructions : each must be coded on a separate card and must be
  -------------- followed by at least one blank, except the NULL
                 instruction which may be followed by another one
                 (obviously not another NULL) or an operator command
                 in the same card.

     *  ...text...
          A starting asterisk (*) means a comment card.

     GDATE  (alias @G)
          Display the date and time of day.

     MESSAGE  ...text...  (alias @M)
          Send a message text to the main console.
          ...text... may be 55 characters long at maximum, otherwise
                    it is truncated.

     PAUSE  ...text...  (alias @P)
          Send a message text to the main console and allow the
          operator to reply in order to continue or stop immediately
          the commands sequence of the current member (EXECUTE) or
          the main member (program).
          The operator response may be 0 up to 8 characters long and
          is available to various other statements (until the next
          PAUSE), unless the reply text is CANCEL, which cause the
          immediate stop as previously explained.
          ...text... may be 55 characters long at maximum, otherwise
                    it is truncated.

     NULL  SSSS  (or :SSSS)
          Define a sequence symbol to which a branch instruction refers
          (i.e. - GOTO, IF's, ...).
          SSSS : is the sequence symbol. It may be 1 up to 8 characters
                    long.

     GOTO  SSSS  (alias GO)
          Allows to branch unconditionally.
          SSSS : is a sequence symbol to which the branch is done
                    (SSSS must be defined in a NULL instruction).
                    SSSS may be 1 up to 8 characters long.

     IF-REPLY  WWWW  ....  SSSS  (alias IF-R)
          Allows to branch according to a test result on the previous
          PAUSE ... operator response. Thus the sequence in which the
          operators commands are processed can be altered.
          WWWW may be one of the following operators :
                    EQ (or =)     NE (or /)     LT (or <)
                    GT (or >)     LE (or <=)    GE (or >=)
          .... : is the desired value to test (to indicate a null
                    response, zero length reply, code '').
                    The test is done with the value length, this means
                    that YES matches also Y in
                         IF-R  EQ  Y  ACCEPT
                    (the branch is taken), or 9 is greater than 50 in
                         IF-R  LE  50  ACCEPT
                    (the branch is not taken).
          SSSS : is a sequence symbol to which the branch is taken if
                    the condition is true, otherwise the process
                    continue in sequence (SSSS must be defined in a
                    NULL instruction).
                    SSSS may be 1 up to 8 characters long.

     IF-REPLY-CHAR  WWWW  ....  SSSS  (alias IF-C)
          Identical to IF-REPLY, but the operator response and the test
          values are collating sequence compared, thus the two values
          are left padded with blanks (so YES does not match Y but is
          greater, and 9 is lower than 50).

     IF-REPLY-BIN  WWWW  ....  SSSS  (alias IF-B)
          Identical to IF-REPLY, but the operator response and the test
          values are considered integer numbers for compare (so 9 is
          less than 50).
                    Note - Plus (+) or minus (-) sign is not accepted.

     IF-REPLY-HEX  WWWW  ....  SSSS  (alias IF-H)
          Identical to IF-REPLY, but the operator response and the test
          values are considered hexadecimals for compare (so F is less
          than A0).
                    Note - Plus (+) or minus (-) sign is not accepted.

     VER-BIN  SSSS  (alias V-B)
     VER-HEX  SSSS  (alias V-H)
          Allows to verify the operator response for only numerics
          (0-9) or hexadecimals (0-9,A-F) characters contents.
          The branch is taken if a wrong character is detected.
                    Note - Plus (+) or minus (-) sign is not accepted.
          SSSS : is a sequence symbol to which the branch is taken if
                    the wrong condition is true, otherwise the process
                    continue in sequence (SSSS must be defined in a
                    NULL instruction).
                    SSSS may be 1 up to 8 characters long.

     IF-REPLY-ID  ....  SSSS  (alias IF-ID)
          Allows to branch according to a search for a reply pending
          ID found. Thus the sequence in which the operators commands
          are processed can be altered.
          .... : is the desired message-ID text (must be at least 8
                    characters long). If any blanks are needed (unless
                    leading blanks up to 8 characters), the message-ID
                    must be given as a quoted characters string, so a
                    needed quote in the text must be doubled.
          SSSS : is a sequence symbol to which the branch is taken
                    if the reply-ID is found, otherwise the process
                    continue in sequence (SSSS must be defined in a
                    NULL instruction).
                    SSSS may be 1 up to 8 characters long.
          When the reply-ID is found, the edited reply number is set
          in the reserved variable named RPID (2 characters long),
          this allowing the &S-RV(RPID)...reply text... string to
          be an operator reply command.

     LOGICAL  VAR1  VAR2  ...  VARN  (alias @L)
          Define processing logical variables (name may be 1 up to 8
          characters long). The initial value of these variables is
          FALSE.

     TRUE  VAR1  VAR2  ...  VARN  (alias @T)
     FALSE  VAR1  VAR2  ...  VARN  (alias @F)
          Set logical variables value to TRUE or FALSE.

     IF-TRUE  VARN  SSSS  (alias IF-T)
     IF-FALSE  VARN  SSSS  (alias IF-F)
          Test the logical variable VARN on TRUE or FALSE value.
          SSSS : is a sequence symbol to which the branch is taken if
                    the condition is met, otherwise the process
                    continue in sequence (SSSS must be defined in a
                    NULL instruction).

     SET-REPLY  VVVV  (aliases SET, SET-VAR)
     SET-VAR  VVVV  ....  (aliases SET, SET-REPLY)
          Memorize the current available PAUSE ... operator response
          (0 up to 8 characters long) or a specific value (0 up to 8
          characters long) in a variable.
          VVVV is the variable name. It may be 1 up to 8 characters
                    long, and cannot be one of the reserved name (see
                    IF QQQQ WWWW .... SSSS statement).
          .... : is the desired value to store (to indicate a null
                    value, zero length, code '').
          Then the string &S-RV(VVVV), into which VVVV is the variable
          name or one of the reserved names (here it is accepted), is
          replaced by the variable value if encountered in the text of
          any MESSAGE, PAUSE, IF-REPLY's, EXECUTE, SUBMIT, T-WAIT,
          COMMON instructions or operators commands.

     IF  QQQQ  WWWW  ....  SSSS
     IF-VAR  VVVV  WWWW  ....  SSSS  (alias IF-V)
          Allows to branch according to the result of a condition test.
          Thus the sequence in which the operators commands are
          processed can be altered.
          QQQQ may be one of the following reserved names :
                    SID : means the system ID (from SMF : SSSS).
                    CPU : means the CPU model (from CVT : MMMM).

                    MONTH : means the current month name (JAN,
                              FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG,
                              SEP, OCT, NOV and DEC).
                    TIME : means the current time of day in
                              hours/minutes (HHMM).
                    HOURS : means the hours (HH part of TIME).

          VVVV is the name of a variable which has been defined by a
                    previous SET-REPLY or SET-VAR. It may be 1 up to 8
                    characters long.
          WWWW may be one of the following operators :
                    EQ (or =)     NE (or /)     LT (or <)
                    GT (or >)     LE (or <=)    GE (or >=)
          .... : is the desired value to test.
                    Note : The test is done with the value length and
                    right justified (i.e. : TIME EQ 945 matches 0945 AM
                    and 1945 PM).
          SSSS : is a sequence symbol to which the branch is taken
                    if the condition is true, otherwise the process
                    continue in sequence (SSSS must be defined in a

          commands sequence, then at end of this member the process
          continue in sequence (up to 99 nested EXECUTE may be
          defined).
          ...PO-dsname... is the partitioned data-set name, and may be
                    1 up to 44 characters long. When * (asterisk) form
                    is coded, it means the current data-set in use.
          ...member-name... may be 1 up to 8 characters long.

     SUBMIT  *(...member-name...)  (alias SUB)
             ...PO-dsname...(...member-name...)

          Allows the SUBMIT of a batch job for conventional processing.
          The job submitted must reside in either a member of a
          partitioned or a sequential data-set.
          Submitted data-set must be fixed 80-bytes records (blocked
          or unblocked).
                    Note : the JCL JOB statement must be the first and
                    may contain all the needed information.
          ...PO-dsname... is the partitioned data-set name, and may be

          The SUBMIT function supplies the password only if the
          USER=... keyword is coded and the PASSWORD=... keyword is
          not coded (this assumes the JOB statement is more than one
          card coded).

     T-WAIT  SECS  (alias @W)
          Allows to wait-a-bit.
