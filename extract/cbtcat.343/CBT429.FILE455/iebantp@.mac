  Purpose :    This is a MAP program which outputs a list giving the
  ---------    description of all the logical files recorded on a
               magnetic tape. The end of tape is assumed when
               reading two consecutive tape-marks (unless empty
               SL-file or special option for NL-file).

               On request, the input tape can be copied, with the
               availability to change the density and/or the volume
               serial number of the output tape (be carefull when
               changing density that the contents must not overflow
               a tape reel capacity : multiple volumes are not
               supported).

               The program accepts only 9-tracks tapes (BLP option).

  3480 Data Cartridge : Now, the program is adapted to run also with
  --------------------- 3480 Data Cartridges (SYSUT1 and/or SYSUT2).

  Check requested operation : With the introduction of the 3480 Data
  --------------------------- Cartridge units, the program has been
               enhanced to perform a validity check on the requested
               operation (tapes and cartridges volumes may be now
               protected against all or some users use).

  Call of the program :
  ---------------------

  1. Tape analysis.

         //ANAL      EXEC  PGM=IEBANTP
         //SYSPRINT    DD  SYSOUT=A
         //SYSUT1      DD  UNIT=TAPE,VOL=SER=......,DSN=...,       C
         //                LABEL=(,BLP),DISP=OLD

  2. Tape copy.

         //COPY      EXEC  PGM=IEBANTP
         //SYSPRINT    DD  SYSOUT=A
         //SYSUT1      DD  UNIT=TAPE,VOL=SER=......,DSN=...,       C
         //                LABEL=(,BLP),DISP=OLD
         //SYSUT2      DD  UNIT=TAPE,VOL=SER=......,DSN=...,       C
         //                LABEL=(,BLP),DISP=NEW
         //SYSIN       DD  *  (optional : see selective copy)
           ... file numbers ...
         /*
         //SYSCHECK    DD  SYSOUT=A  (optional : see selective copy)

         Note : When SYSUT2 is a 3480 Data Cartridge, the true label
                is indicated by the VOL=SER=...... DD-parameter.

  Density and Volume Serial Number : Not applyable to 3480 (ignored
  ---------------------------------- if specified).
               A density and/or a new volume serial number can be
         assigned to the output tape (SYSUT2) using the parameter's
         field of the EXEC statement as follows :

         //COPY      EXEC  PGM=IEBANTP,PARM='DEN=X,SER=NNNNNN'

         or the short form :

         //COPY      EXEC  PGM=IEBANTP,PARM='D=X,S=NNNNNN'

         where : X = 2 for 800 bpi.    (not applyable to 3480)
                     3 for 1600 bpi.
                     4 for 6250 bpi.

                 NNNNNN = new volume serial number.

               If the density cannot be determined from SYSUT1 or
         is not declared by the DEN= parameter, then the default of
         1600 bpi is assumed for the copied tape (SYSUT2).

  Bypass operator advice message : Always set when 3480 (ignored if
  -------------------------------- specified).
               When copying, the operator advice messages about
         tapes correctly mounted (to get him a last chance against
         contents destruction) may be suppressed as follows :

         //...       EXEC  PGM=IEBANTP,PARM='...,NOVEROP,...'
         or :
         //...       EXEC  PGM=IEBANTP,PARM='...,N,...'

  Block count (EURATOM modification) :
  ------------------------------------
               When copying standard labeled tapes (SYSUT1-SYSUT2),
         one can ask to compute again and rewrite the block count
         (number of physical records) in the trailer label (EOF1)
         by specifying : PARM='...,BLKCOUNT' or PARM='...,B'.

  Special use (EURATOM modification) :
  ------------------------------------
               Some applications in the centre produce no labeled
         (NL) tapes (i.e. - laboratories analysis recorder) with a
         large number of files (tape-marks). Often it is desirable
         for further computations, to merge all these files in only
         one (NL). This is done by the program when providing the
         keyword COPYSKIP as in the example below :

         //COPYSK    EXEC  PGM=IEBANTP,PARM='COPYSKIP'
         or :
         //COPYSK    EXEC  PGM=IEBANTP,PARM='C'
         //SYSPRINT    DD  SYSOUT=A
         //SYSUT1      DD  UNIT=TAPE,VOL=SER=......,DSN=...,       C
         //                LABEL=(,BLP),DISP=OLD
         //SYSUT2      DD  UNIT=TAPE,VOL=SER=......,DSN=...,       C
         //                LABEL=(,BLP),DISP=NEW

               The keyword COPYSKIP is accepted only when SYSUT2
         is present (copy). It can be used in conjunction with the
         keywords DEN and SER (this last is just for information
         on the output list), and the keyword BLKCOUNT is ignored.

                                                      IEBANTP   4/6.

  Archive (EURATOM modification) :
  --------------------------------
               Another modification to the program allows the copy
         of an input tape after the contents of an output tape,
         thus expanding the SYSUT2 tape.

         //COPYAD    EXEC  PGM=IEBANTP,PARM='ADD,DEN=X,SER=NNNNNN'
         or :
         //COPYAD    EXEC  PGM=IEBANTP,PARM='A,D=X,S=NNNNNN'
         //SYSPRINT    DD  SYSOUT=A
         //SYSUT1      DD  UNIT=TAPE,VOL=SER=......,DSN=...,       C
         //                LABEL=(,BLP),DISP=OLD
         //SYSUT2      DD  UNIT=TAPE,VOL=SER=......,DSN=...,       C
         //                LABEL=(,BLP),DISP=...

               The SYSUT2 disposition first subparameter is OLD
         if the tape is not passed from a previous step, otherwise
         use MOD in order to left the tape positioned at the end,
         thus gain time preventing the rewind.

               The keyword ADD requires the keywords SER and
         DEN to be present, the keyword BLKCOUNT is optionally
         usable, and the keyword COPYSKIP is not accepted.

  Selective copy (EURATOM modification) :
  ---------------------------------------
               Only with normal or archive copy operations, a list
         of those desired files, to be copied from the SYSUT1 tape
         on the SYSUT2 tape, may be supplied by the SYSIN input.

         Card format : the files numbers can be specified in any
                       order from col.1 up to col.72 included.
                       Single (N) or range (N-NN) of files numbers
                       must be separated each from the others by
                       at least one blank. Each card starts new
                       single or range information. As soon as an
                       asterisk (*) is encountered, the rest of the
                       card is considered comments.
         Note : the files numbers refers to NL or SL files depending
                on the automatic type recognition of the SYSUT1 tape.

               Keywords COPYSKIP and BLKCOUNT are not allowed. You
         may use a SYSCHECK DD-card if you want a check list.

  Sequence numbers adjustment :
  -----------------------------
               The keywords V= and Q= may be used to set the
         volume sequence number and the starting data-set sequence
         number when copying standard labeled (SL) tapes only :

         //COPYAD    EXEC  PGM=IEBANTP,PARM='...,V=NNNN,Q=PPPP,...'

         where : NNNN is the desired volume sequence number (one to
                     four numerics, value may be 1 to 9999).
                 PPPP is the desired starting data-set sequence
                     number (one to four numerics, value may be 1
                     to 9999).
         Note : these adjustments are automatically done when an
                archive operation is requested.

  Dump analysis :
  ---------------
               If a SYSANAL DD-card is supplied, then the program
         uses it to dump the first record (for a maximum length of
         1024 bytes) of each file encountered on the tape (SYSUT1).

               If a SYSUDUMP or SYSABEND DD-card is present and
         an unexpected error occurs reading the input tape (SYSUT1)
         or writing the output tape (SYSUT2), a dump with abend code
         U0001 is taken, otherwise only an I/O error message is
         supplied.

  Bypass input tape I/O error :
  -----------------------------
               Any I/O error (i.e. - data check) when reading the
         input tape (SYSUT1) may be bypassed by specifying the
         keyword FORCE. If a SYSERR DD-card is supplied, the
         wrong record is dumped on it (for a maximum length of 1024
         bytes), and when the operation is a copy tape, the record is
         copied on the output tape (SYSUT2) as entered in memory.

         //...       EXEC  PGM=IEBANTP,PARM='...,FORCE,...'
         or :
         //...       EXEC  PGM=IEBANTP,PARM='...,F,...'

  Bypass consecutive tape-marks :
  -------------------------------
               Sometime, a no labeled (NL) tape may contain empty
         files, so it is necessary to inform the program about this
         situation. The approximative number of files, before two
         consecutive tape-marks which is considered the end of tape,
         may be supplied using the parameter's field of the EXEC
         statement as below :

         //...       EXEC  PGM=IEBANTP,PARM='...,EVEN=NNNNN,...'
         or :
         //...       EXEC  PGM=IEBANTP,PARM='...,E=NNNNN,...'

         where : NNNNN is the expected files number (one to five
                     numerics, value may be 1 to 99999).


   *****************************************************************
   REMARK :    you can build mixed NL and SL files tapes, but then,
   ********    be carefull in any further processing of these tapes,
               you probably will have troubles of course.
