  Function :  To do HEX and DECIMAL integer arithmetic on 3278/9 CRT
  ----------  terminals in full-screen mode.

  Syntax :    ARITH or AR (alias)
  --------    Description : The purpose of this command is to do HEX
                   and DECIMAL integer arithmetic in full-screen mode
                   on 3278/9 CRT terminals. The command is menu driven.
              In addition HEX and DECIMAL arithmetic, an option is
                   available to do HEX to DECIMAL and DECIMAL to HEX
                   conversions. Another option gives the user ability
                   to convert 3270 Screen and Buffer Addresses to
                   Row/Column Addresses, and vice versa.
              To get back to the menu screen from any of the option
                   screens, simply press the PA1 (ATTN) key. Another
                   way of doing this is to enter =X and press ENTER.
                   In fact, you can get around in ARITH if you can
                   remember the option numbers by entering an = sign
                   followed by the option number and pressing ENTER
                   (=0 will return to TSO).
              Also the PF-keys for corresponding options (1-9) are
                   availables.
  Operands :  None, other than as specified above.
