              IOPT : a fullword variable which indicates the following
                       open options :
                           INPUT    0          DISP     0
                           INOUT    3          REREAD  16

              ISPEC : a fullword response variable. This argument is
                       optional, but if supplied, it must contain the
                       value 1 before any read or write request. After
                       the operation, it can contain the following
                       value :
                         1 - operation correctly executed.
                         2 - an error has been detected.
                         3 - the END-OF-FILE has been encountered.
                       If this argument is not supplied, and an error
                       or the END-OF-FILE condition is detected, the
                       program execution is terminated.
              AREA : array for read or write operations. The argument
                       is optional, but if supplied, it will be used
                       as default in case it is omitted at the time
                       an operation is requested (SREAD or SWRITE).

    CALL SREAD (DCBAR,AREA)
               (-----)

              DCBAR : the SOPEN variable used by the package, his
                       contents must never be modified by the program
                       during the file is active (until closed).
              AREA : array where a record is read. The argument is
                       mandatory if not supplied by SOPEN. If present,
                       it is used for read even if also supplied in
                       SOPEN.

                       backspaces (physical records blocks) to be
                       executed. If N is omitted, the default value is
                       one. If N is negative or zero, the operation is
                       bypassed. After the END-OF-FILE, the backspace
                       is not allowed.

  2. DSORG=DA :
  =============

    Preliminary advice : a DSORG=DA file should be created using
    -------------------- the SOPEN, SWRITE and SCLOSE routines. No
                         records can be added to the file after his
                         creation, but they can be only read or
                         updated. The processing of files with keys
                         is possible, but the keys are unaccessible,
                         and the records can be retrieved only by
                         their sequential number of order in the file.
                         The creation of files with keys are not
                         possible with this I/O package routines.

              NREC : a fullword variable to be used at read or write
                       requests (DREAD or DWRITE). The argument is
                       optional, but if supplied, it will be used as
                       default in case it is omitted at the time of
                       the operation.
              AREA : array for read or write operations. The argument
                       is optional, but if supplied, it will be used
                       as default in case it is omitted at the time

              NREC : a fullword variable containing the record number
                       to be read (the file starts with the record
                       number zero). The argument is mandatory if not
                       supplied by DOPEN. If present, it is used for
                       read even if also supplied in DOPEN.
              AREA : array where a record is read. The argument is
                       mandatory if not supplied by DOPEN. If present,

  3. DSORG=IS :
  =============

  A. Create and read aequentially the file.
  -----------------------------------------

    Preliminary advice : a DSORG=IS file should be created in a
    -------------------- sequential way (by ascending keys order).
                         Dummy records can be inserted at the file
                         creation to prepare space for further adds
                         or updates. A dummy record is a record
                         having as first byte the hexadecimal value
                         X'FF' (see Data Management manual).

                       you want to have dummy records in the file).
              ISPEC : a fullword response variable (see SOPEN).
              AREA : array for write operations. The argument is
                       optional, but if supplied, it will be used
                       as default in case it is omitted at the time
                       an operation is requested (CRWRIT).

                       argument is optional, if omitted, the file is
                       positioned at the beginning. This call is used
                       to position the file in the way that the next
                       call to REREAD will obtain the record having
                       the key equal. Note that the successive values
                       of key must be in ascending order, and two calls
                       to SETL must be separated by a call to ESETL.

  B. Adds and updates to the file.
  --------------------------------

    Preliminary advice : the following routines always gives back,
    -------------------- if existing, the record having the key equal
                         to that requested. It is user responsability
                         to recognize a dummy record, and perhaps
                         modify it in a true record by changing the
                         first byte from the hexadecimal value X'FF'

                       0 (zero), the array is considered unexistant.
                       Program execution degradation occurs when this
                       array is not supplied, we suggest the user to
                       define it as large as a track capacity of the
                       device supporting the file.

              LMSW : a fullword variable containing the length (in
                       bytes) of MSWA array. If the length value is

              ISPEC : a fullword response variable. This argument is
                       optional, but if supplied, it must contain the
                       value 1 before any read or write request. After
                       the operation, it can contain the following
                       value :
                         1 - operation correctly executed.
                         2 - an error has been detected.

                             boundaries.
                         4 - the requested record is not found.
                       If this argument is not supplied, and the error
                       condition 2, 3 or 4 is detected, the program
                       execution is terminated.
