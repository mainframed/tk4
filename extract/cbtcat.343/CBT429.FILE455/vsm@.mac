  Purpose :    The Virtual Storage Monitor is a command processor
  ---------    designed to assist in identifying virtual storage
               problems, particularly those associated with CSA
               utilization. Mainly it is composed of three functions,
               as below :

                1. VIRTUAL STORAGE MAP : it will show the high and low
                   virtual address of SQA, PLPA , CSA, the private area
                   and the NUCLEUS. It will also show the size of each
                   area in MEG and in K.

                2. CSA/SQA SUBPOOL UTILIZATION : it will show the
                   amount of free or unalloacted space in each subpool,
                   the largest contiguous free space and the percentage
                   free or unused.

                3. CSA SUBPOOL UTILIZATION by protect key.

  Authority :  only system group USER-id's are authorized to issue
  -----------  this command.

  BATCH run :  The Virtual Storage Monitor may run in BATCH like a
  -----------  program called as below :
               //VSMXB  EXEC  PGM=VSM,PARM=...
                                 or : PARM='$/...'
               where $ is the sysout class (default is A), and
                     ... are the desired VSM funstions.
               I.e. - PARM=12R3R
               If you want, you may also use a pre-allocated JCL DD
               for the hardcopy output, as i.e. below :
               //VSMHCOPY  DD SYSOUT=*
