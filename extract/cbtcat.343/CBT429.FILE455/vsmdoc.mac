                  ***  VIRTUAL STORAGE MONITOR  ***
                  *********************************

     THE VIRTUAL STORAGE MONITOR IS DESIGNED TO ASSIST IS IDENTIFYING
 VIRTUAL STORAGE PROBLEMS, PARTICULARLY THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH CSA
 UTILIZATION. VSM IS A COMMAND PROCESSOR. IT HAS BEEN TESTED ON
 MVS/SP1.1.1 AND ON SP1.3. VSM IS DESIGNED TO RUN WITH ACF/VTAM BUT
 SHOULD WORK WITH TCAM IF A FEW CHANGES ARE MADE.

 INSTALLATION :
 --------------

 DSECTS :

     VSM USES A NUMBER OF DSECTS FOR IBM CONTROL BLOCKS. WE CODED
 THEM OURSELVES BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE SYS1.PVTMACS. IF YOU DO HAVE
 SYS1.PVTMACS YOU CAN CHANGE OUR CODE TO PICKUP THE IBM SUPPLIED
 DSECTS. IF YOU DO NOT HAVE SYS1.PVTMACS AND DO NOT WANT TO USE OUR
 DSECTS TAKE THEM OUT AND CODE THE OFFSETS (TEDIOUS).
     THE EASIEST APPROACH IS TO PLACE THIS LIBRARY FIRST IN THE SYSLIB
 CONCATENATION AND USE OUR DSECTS.

 KEY ZERO :

     VSM00200 AND VSM00300 NEED TO BE IN KEY ZERO IN ORDER TO READ
 THE FETCH PROTECTED SUBPOOLS IN CSA. WE ACCOMPLISH THIS BY USING AN
 INHOUSE MACRO (PKEY) TO INVOKE AN IN-HOUSE SVC WHICH FLIPS BIT 15 IN
 THE PSW ON AND OFF. DO A FIND ON PKEY IN THE TWO MODULES MENTIONED AND
 EITHER INSERT YOUR OWN SVC OR REPLACE PKEY WITH THE MODESET MACRO AND
 THEN UPDATE THE APPROPRIATE TABLES (IKJEFTE2 AND/OR IKJEFTE8). PKEY
 APPEARS TWICE IN EACH MODULE; ONCE TO GET INTO KEY ZERO AND ONCE TO
 RETURN TO PROBLEM STATE.

 VTAM/TCAM :

     WE RUN ACF/VTAM RELEASE 3. IF YOU DO ALSO SO SHOULD NOT HAVE
 PROBLEMS. IF YOU RUN TCAM YOU MAY HAVE TO CHANGE THE DEVICE ORDERS.
 FURTHERMORE YOU MAY HAVE TO REMOVE THE STFSMODE MACROS FROM MODULES
 VSM00000 AND VSM99000.

 TAILORING :

     THE PRIMARY MENU IS CREATED IN MODULE VSM. TO CHANGE THE HEADER
 FROM HALLMARK CARDS DO A FIND ON HALLMARK IN MODULE VSM00000. CHANGE
 TO YOUR OWN HEADER AND CHANGE THE COLUMN INDICATOR IN THE LINE ABOVE
 TO CENTER YOUR HEADER.
     MODULE VSM00300 SHOWS CSA UTILIZATION BY PROTECT KEY. A NAME IS
 ASSIGNED TO THOSE PROTECT KEYS IN USE HERE. KEYS 2-4 AND 7 ARE NOT
 USED HERE AND HENCE THE NAME IS BLANK. TO INSERT THE NAME YOU WANT
 (EX : VSPC OR IMS) EDIT MODULE VSM00300 AND FIND #0XNAME WHERE X IS
 THE PROTECT KEY THEN EDIT THE 10 BYTE FIELD.

 ASSEMBLY :

     THE LIBRARY CREATED FROM THE DISTRIBUTION TAPE SHOULD BE IN THE
 SYSLIB CONCATENATION TO PICKUP SOME IN-HOUSE MACROS THAT WE USE.

 LINK :

     VSM SHOULD BE LINKED REUS. IF YOU USE MODESET VSM MUST BE LINKED
 AC(1). IF YOU USE AN AUTHORIZATION SVC THE NEED FOR AC(1) WILL DEPEND
 ON WHETHER YOUR SVC CHECKS FOR IT OR NOT.

     ASSEMBLE AND LINK VSM00100,VSM00200,VSM00300,VSM99000 AND VSMHELP.
 ASSEMBLE VSM00000 AND INCLUDE THE ABOVE MODULES WHEN YOU DO THE LINK.
 WE THEN COPY VSM00000 INTO CMDLIB AND RENAME IT TO VSM.

 DISCLAIMER :
 ------------

     THE PROGRAMS IN THIS FILE ARE BEING CONTRIBUTED TO THE CBT MODS
 TAPE TO HELP OTHER USERS OF IBM'S MVS OPERATING SYSTEM. THEY MAY BE
 FREELY DISTRIBUTED TO OTHER ORGANIZATIONS OR INDIVIDUALS PROVIDED THAT
 THEY ARE NOT DISTRIBUTED FOR PROFIT AND THAT THIS DISCLAIMER IS ALSO
 DISTRIBUTED.

     THE PROGRAMS CONTAINED IN THIS FILE WERE WRITTEN AT HALLMARK CARDS
 ENFIELD, CT. TO THE BEST OF OUR KNOWLEDGE THEY FUNCTION AS INTENDED AND
 AS DOCUMENTED WITHOUT CAUSING SYSTEM OR INTEGRITY PROBLEMS. HOWEVER,
 THEY ARE NOT COVERED BY ANY WARRANTY, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, AS
 TO THE RELIABILITY OR FITNESS FOR USE AT ANY INSTALLATION OTHER THAN
 HALLMARK CARDS. NO COMMITMENT IS MADE THAT WE WILL MAINTAIN THESE
 PROGRAMS OR THAT THEY WILL FUNCTION WITH LATER RELEASES OF MVS OR VTAM.

 CBT MODIFICATIONS :
 -------------------

 WE USE ACF/TCAM AT CBT AND IT RUNS FINE.
 WE AT CBT MADE THE FOLLOWING CHANGES TO THE CODE SO IT WOULD RUN
 ALL OUR CHANGES ARE MARKED 'CBT-AXC' :
  - IN VSM00000 WE USED OUR HEADER RATHER THAN HALLMARK'S
  - IN VSM00200 WE USED OUR SVC INSTEAD OF PKEY
  - IN VSM00300 WE USED OUR SVC INSTEAD OF PKEY

 EURATOM MODIFICATIONS :
 -----------------------

 ALL OUR CHANGES ARE MARKED '-EU-' :
  - IN VSM00000 WE USED S. REL. RATHER THAN 'CBT-AXC' HEADER AND WE
                ADDED SYSTEM SUPPORT PERSONNEL ONLY CONTROL
  - IN VSM00200 WE USED OUR SVC INSTEAD OF CBT SVC
  - IN VSM00300 WE USED OUR SVC INSTEAD OF CBT SVC

 AT 12 NOV 1986, VSM NOW ADAPTED FOR MVS/XA :
  - IN VSM001XA, VSM002XA AND VSM003XA ADDED
  - VSM88000 : DEBUGING AID MODULE ADDED
  - VSM77000 : HARDCOPY MODULE ADDED

 AT 04 FEB 1987, VSM ADAPTED TO A BATCH RUN

 AT 07 APR 1988, VSM FOR MVS/XA ONLY :
  - MODULES VSM001XA, VSM002XA AND VSM003XA NORMALLY RENAMED VSM00100,
                VSM00200 AND VSM00300
