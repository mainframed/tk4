  Purpose :    This is a short operational package to be used only
  ---------    when user's accounting must be controlled or obtained
               (exclusively the first section of the data-set is
               reachable by these routines).
               The accounting information data-set is accesses
               through a DD-card coded as below :

               //SYSACC   DD  DSN=...,DISP=SHR
                                           OLD

         Note : the key (argument or index) length is assumed to
                be two bytes (halfword) long, and may or not be
                included in the accounting information record.

  MVS/XA :     Must be AMODE and RMODE 24.

  Calling sequence : CALL YOPEN,(A,B),VL
  -------------------           (A)

         Where : A - is the address of the indicator response (format
                     FULLWORD - F boundary). Value is always placed
                     in register 15 and can be :
                     0 (zero) - the data-set is correctly opened.
                     + (positive) - error number. The data-set is
                                    not opened.

                 B - is the address of the eventual keyword DUMP
                     (format CL4) to request a dump on error detected
                     by the routines (SYSUDUMP or SYSABEND DD-card is
                     needed). This option is effective until the close,
                     and the error number is set as abend code.

  Calling sequence : CALL YREAD,(A,B,C),VL
  ------------------

         Where : A - is the address of the indicator response (format
                     FULLWORD - F boundary). Value is always placed
                     in register 15 and can be :
                     0 (xero) - the data record is correctly read.
                     + (positive) - error number.

                 B - is the address of the argument (format HALFWORD -
                     H boundary).

                 C - is the address of the data record area (format
                     CL... - see macro $AIRD for length).

  Calling sequence : CALL YCLOSE,(A),VL
  ------------------

         Where : A - is the address of the indicator response (format
                     FULLWORD - F boundary). Value is always placed
                     in register 15 and can be :
                     0 (zero) - the data-set is correctly closed.
                     + (positive) - error number.

  Error number :     1 - routine or data-set table destroyed.
  --------------     2 - SYSACC DD-card is missing.
                     3 - SYSACC unit is not a direct-access storage.
                     4 - SYSACC JFCB read error.
                     5 - SYSACC DD-card incorrectly coded.
                     6 - OBTAIN error while processing SYSACC volume.
                     7 - SYSACC DSCB format 1 error detected.
                    10 - SYSACC data-set OPEN error.
                    13 - SYSACC data-set is already opened.
                    14 - SYSACC data-set is not opened.
                    15 - READ request - argument not found.
                    16 - READ request - I/O error.
                    19 - routine calling sequence or argument error.
                    20 - SYSACC data-set wrongly or not cataloged.
                    24 - Unauthorized to access the accounting packages.
