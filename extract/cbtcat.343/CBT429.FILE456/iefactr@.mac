  Purpose :
  ---------

         1. At step termination (R0=12, SMF record 4, 34) :
               Update SRB time limit :
                 SRB.TIME.LIMIT = SRB.TIME.LIMIT - STEP.SRB.TIME
               If new SRB.TIME.LIMIT equal zero, then :
                 SRB.TIME.LIMIT = 1
               If new SRB.TIME.LIMIT less than zero, then :
                 CANCEL the job
               If SRB.TIME.LIMIT equal zero :
                 no SRB timing performed

         2. At job termination (R0=16, SMF record 5, 35) :
               Reset SRB time limit to zero (it is better), and
               if end of a job (SMF record 5) :
                 write to SYSOUT the job service units values and
                 the job cost (in U.O.).

         3. At job/step termination (R0=20, SMF record 30) :
               At end of step, if step was not flushed :
                 write to SYSOUT a row with job name, step name,
                 program name and number of I/O.
               At end of job, if job with more than 1 step :
                 write to SYSOUT a row with job name, job class,
                 performance group and number of I/O.

         4. If system task (STC), at step termination :
               Any not zero completion code is signaled to operator.

  SRB time eveluation :
  ---------------------

         One (1) second of SRB time is equivalent to the execution of
         thousand (1000) I/O operations (in the worst case), but this
         is CPU dependent, and the real SRB time may vary with trace
         on or off, access method and/or programming language used
         (i.e., the assembler is normally more than twice faster).

         Note : see assembler macro $SIDTB (SIDIO table) for systems
                apply factors.
