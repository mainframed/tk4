  CBT origin : Extracted from CBT tape 86 FEB, file 313.
  ------------

  Purpose :    TSO HELP data-set lister.
  ---------

  JCL :  //LIST    EXEC PGM=HELPLIST,PARM='...'
  -----  //SYSHELP   DD DSN=...HELP data-set...,DISP=SHR
         //             ...concatenated HELP data-set if needed...
         //SYSINDEX  DD ...index data-set output if requested...
         //SYSPRINT  DD ...list data-set output...
         //SYSDIAG   DD ...list of input if desired...
         //SYSIN     DD ...input data-set (control cards)...

  NOTE - It is assumed, and thus mandatory, that the COMMANDS member
         in the HELP data-set follows the rules listed below :
         1. all cards not commands subgroup titles or commands names
            must have columns 1 up to 8 blanks (this allows them to
            be handled as not operative cards).
         2. a commands subgroup title must start between cards columns
            1 up to 8 of the card, and must be followed at least by
            one not operative card.
         3. a command name of a subgroup must start in card column 1,
            and his description must not start before card column 10
            and it must be complete into the card column 72 (do not
            extend the description in the following card nor insert
            not operative cards between command name cards). Then, at
            the end of the command name cards, and before the next
            commands subgroup title card, a not operative card must
            be present.

  CONTROL cards :
  ---------------

       - *HEAD= (COL.1-6) control cards to supply list headers (50
            characters maximum).
       - *SKEY= (COL.1-6) control cards to select keywords matches
            into headers (*HEAD= control card) and list only these
            commands subgroups.
       - the HELP members names control cards are variable coding with
            multiple member names (ALIAS names are listed as commands
            unless immediately followed by /A to be printed as alias
            of next) and P=... keywords to set specific page numbers
            (may be 1 up to 99999).

                                                      HELPLIST  2/3.

  PARM field :
  ------------

       Use PARM= in JCL EXEC card to optionally specify :
            L=... set the number of lines per page (default is 60,
                  may be 20 op to 999),
            I     request general index generation (SYSINDEX).
            M     generate manual header/trailer pages.

  Supplied features :
  -------------------

       - Automatic use of the HELP member COMMANDS (see NOTE) to
         generate :
         1. a complete HELP list when the general index (PARM=I) is
            requested and the SYSIN DD-card is omited or dummy, or
            the SYSIN file contains only a *HEAD= control card and/or
            *SKEY= control cards (selection of subgroups in COMMANDS
            member).
         2. a list of the HELP COMMANDS member only when the general
            index is not requested and the SYSIN DD-card is omited or
            dummy, or the SYSIN file contains only a *HEAD= control
            card (any encountered *SKEY= control cards have no effect
            in this case).
       - Only if the SYSDIAG DD-card is present, a list of the input
            is supplied.

  EXAMPLES of use :
  -----------------

       1. List only the content of the COMMANDS member :
          //...  JOB ...
          //LIST    EXEC PGM=HELPLIST
          //SYSHELP   DD DSN=SYS1.HELP,DISP=SHR
          //SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*

       2. List a complete HELP manual with index using the member
          COMMANDS :
          //...  JOB ...
          //LIST    EXEC PGM=HELPLIST,PARM=I
          //SYSHELP   DD DSN=SYS1.HELP,DISP=SHR
          //SYSINDEX  DD SYSOUT=*
          //SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*

                                                      HELPLIST  3/3.

       3. List a partial HELP manual with index using the member
          COMMANDS and select into it the requested subgroups of
          commands as specified by keywords :
          //...  JOB ...
          //LIST    EXEC PGM=HELPLIST,PARM=I
          //SYSHELP   DD DSN=SYS1.HELP,DISP=SHR
          //SYSINDEX  DD SYSOUT=*
          //SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*
          //SYSIN     DD *
          *SKEY=  VSAM  RACF
          /*

       4. Build a specific manual with index using selected HELP
          members and predefined page numbers, set the number of
          lines per page to 58, and list the input :
          //...  JOB ...
          //LIST    EXEC PGM=HELPLIST,PARM='I,L=58'
          //SYSHELP   DD DSN=SYS1.HELP,DISP=SHR
          //SYSINDEX  DD SYSOUT=*
          //SYSDIAG   DD SYSOUT=*
          //SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*
          //SYSIN     DD *
          *HEAD=   ALL COMMANDS
                   P=10     COMMANDS
          *HEAD=   TSO COMMANDS
                   P=100    CALL      EX/A      EXEC      LOAD
                   LOADGO
          *HEAD=   RACF COMMANDS
                   P=200    ADDSD     ALTDSD    DELDSD    LISTDSD
                   PE/A      PERMIT
          *HEAD=   DMS COMMANDS
                   P=300    DARCHIVE  DRESTORE
          *HEAD=   LOCAL COMMANDS
                   P=400    AGENDA    CERCA     CDSCB     CJSD
                   FS/A      FSPACE    QED
          *HEAD=   LIBRARIAN COMMANDS
                   P=500    LIBADD    LIBCTL    LIBGET
          /*
