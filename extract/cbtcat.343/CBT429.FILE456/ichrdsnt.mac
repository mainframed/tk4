* PURPOSE :    DESCRIBE THE RACF DATA BASES TO RACF.
* ---------    THIS TABLE CONTAINS ENTRIES DESCRIBING EACH RACF
*              DATA BASE AND ITS BACKUP DATA BASE. A DATA BASE'S
*              POSITION IN THIS TABLE CORRESPONDS TO THE DATA BASE
*              NUMBER IN THE RANGE TABLE.
*
* DESCRIPTION : THE MODULE SHOULD CONSIST OF A TABLE IN THE FOLLOWING
* ------------- FORMAT :
*        - THE FIRST BYTE IS A BINARY NUMBER INDICATING THE NUMBER OF
*          ENTRIES IN THE TABLE.
*        - EACH ENTRY CONSISTS OF TWO 44-BYTE DATA BASE NAMES, A 1-BYTE
*          RESIDENT INDEX BLOCK (OR DATA BLOCK) COUNT FIELD, AND A
*          1-BYTE FLAG FIELD.
*          THE FIRST DATA BASE NAME IS THAT OF A PRIMARY DATA BASE. IF
*          THIS FIELD IS AN ASTERISK, RACF PROMPTS THE OPERATOR DURING
*          INITIALIZATION, TO SUPPLY THE DATA BASE NAME. THE SECOND
*          DATA BASE NAME IS THAT OF AN ASSOCIATED BACKUP DATA BASE.
*          IF THIS FIELD IS AN ASTERISK, RACF PROMPTS THE OPERATOR
*          AGAIN. A BLANK DATA BASE NAME FIELD INDICATES THE ABSENCE
*          OF EITHER A PRIMARY OR BACKUP DATA BASE, OR BOTH, FOR THIS
*          IPL. THE FIRST PRIMARY RACF DATA BASE IS CONSIDERED TO BE
*          THE "MASTER" RACF DATA BASE.
*          THE RESIDENT INDEX BLOCK COUNT FIELD SPECIFIES THE MAXIMUM
*          NUMBER OF INDEX BLOCKS TO BE KEPT RESIDENT FOR THE PRIMARY
*          DATA BASE WHILE IT IS ACTIVE. IF YOU SELECT THE RESIDENT
*          DATA BLOCKS OPTION, THIS FIELD SPECIFIES THE MAXIMUM NUMBER
*          OF INDEX, BAM, AND PROFILE BLOCKS TO BE KEPT RESIDENT.
*          THE FORMAT OF THE FLAG FIELD IS AS FOLLOWS :
*          BIT SETTING - MEANING
*          00.. ....     NO UPDATES ARE TO BE DUPLICATED IN THE BACKUP
*                        DATA BASE.
*          10.. ....     ALL UPDATES, OTHER THAN STATISTICS, ARE TO BE
*                        DUPLICATED ON THE BACKUP DATA BASE.
*          11.. ....     ALL UPDATES, INCLUDING STATISTICS, ARE TO BE
*                        DUPLICATED ON THE BACKUP DATA BASE.
*          .... ...1     USE THE RESIDENT DATA BLOCK OPTION FOR THE
*                        PRIMARY DATA BASE.
