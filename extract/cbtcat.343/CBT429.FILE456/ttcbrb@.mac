  Purpose :    TSO command, program or routine to list the current
  ---------    Address Space TCB-RB's chain.
               Note : normally the list is outputed to the terminal,
                      but, when the TSO "PUTLINE" function is not
                      available, a "SYSOUT" is dynamically allocated.
                      If a pre-allocated "TTRLLIST" FILE or DD-card
                      is present, then, the list is outputed to it.
               Test : pre-allocate a "TTRLTEST" FILE or DD-card to
                      get also internal tables trace list.

  How to use : TSO command       = TTCBRB
  ------------ BATCH execution   = //LSTCB   EXEC PGM=TTCBRB
               In Assembler, LINK or CALL as program or routine with
               register 1 zero   = XR    R1,R1
                                   LINK  EP=TTCBRB or CALL  TTCBRB
               Last but not least, in ISPF Edit = TRAP TTCBRB
                                   (set the list in the Edit data)
