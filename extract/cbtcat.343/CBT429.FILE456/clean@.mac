  Purpose :    This program is part of our "DAILY" procedure.
  ---------    Its intent is to verify the match between DASD volumes
  contents (VTOCs), O.S. and/or ICF catalogs contents and RACF discrete
  and/or generic profiles contents, then clean or correct all erroneous
  and undesirable references. Sometimes, because of complex combinations
  encountered, the recovery fails or the unusual situation is signaled
  by "intervention required", which informs about a manual correction
  necessity to solve these cases. Note that also a wrong status between
  catalogs, RACF and DASD may need more than one execution of the
  program before the complete recovery. Finally, during VTOC's read,
  an elementary data-sets accounting may be collected.

         T or TEST : normal run, but force all modifications to
               VTOC's, catalogs and RACF to be bypassed, suppress
               the header and trailer page print, and, when an
               error is detected, abends (U0033) with dump (SYSUDUMP

         The control cards must be given by group in the same order
         as they are described below, each group starting always on

               they can be in any order (the last one is in effect if
               there is some keywords conflict).

     Keywords :

               user's/data-sets accesses, group's/data-sets accesses
               are listed.

         - DS-SHORT
               only the status of data-sets with actions scheduled are
               listed (SYSLIST).
               Note : this is the default option.

         - DS-SHGDG
               the status of data-sets with actions scheduled and the
               GDG's information are listed (SYSLIST).

               suppress the list (SYSLIST) of the catalogs dsname's
               and O.S. CVOL pointers entries.

               in a new data-set automatically created with the

               START command may be given, which will be internally
               issued at the end (this allows the start of another job
               to handle the copy data-set).

               profiles.
               Optionally, may be specified after a prefix :

                      signal on the standard output list.

               separated each from the other by at least one blank
               (maximum is 44 characters long). A name must be always
               complete within the 72 columns range.

               requirements control statements. If Y... is omitted,
               the previous data-set name is used.
               The use of ACCOUNT * form assumes that the accounting
               requirements control statements coding follows in the
               current input-stream. The end of these requirements is
               detected by another ACCOUNT keyword or the EL.VOL.
               next mandatory group keyword in a new control card.

     Coding rules :
               The member name may be from 1 to 8 characters long, and
               must be always complete within the 72 columns range.

         Accounting requirements control statements :
         --------------------------------------------

         Coding rules :

         The request statements are free format, they may start
         anywhere from column 1 up to column 72 included of the
         cards, and a card may contain more than one statement.
         Each statement is composed of a command and eventually
         operands as described in commands, and must be always
         complete within the 72 columns range, thus no continuation
         is provided ,but a command may be repeated to supply all
         requirements. At least one blank must separate statements,
         commands and operands.

               where XXXXXX are VOLUME SERIAL NUMBER names of the
               disks to be analyzed.

     Coding rules :
               The VOLUME SERIAL NUMBER names are accepted anywhere
               from column 1 up to column 72 included. They must be
               separated each from the other by at least one blank,
               and may be from 1 to 6 characters long (when shorter
               than 6 characters it means a group of volume serial
               numbers, obviously starting by this prefix). A name
               must be always complete within the 72 columns range.

               NUMBER names of the disks containing an O.S. catalog
               (data-set name is SYSCTLG, thus known), and XXXXXX /
               Y... is the form to indicate the VOLUME SERIAL NUMBER
               names of the disks containing an ICF catalog (data-set
               name is Y...).

     Coding rules :
               The VOLUME SERIAL NUMBER names are accepted anywhere
               from column 1 up to column 72 included. They must be
               separated each from the other by at least one blank,
               and must be 6 characters long. A data-set name is 44
               characters long at maximum. A name, eventually followed
               by a data-set name (ICF), must be always complete
               within the 72 columns range.

               as member names (prefixed by the character L : LXXXXXX)
               of the cataloged partitioned data-set Y... which will
               contain the data-set names for which the eventual
               locate is to be skiped when the specified volume is
               not on-line (these data-sets are marked as exempted).
               If Y... is omitted, the previous data-set name is used.
               The asterisk (*) form assumes the data-set names follow
               the volume serial number name (XXXXXX) in the current
               input-stream. The member or input-stream may contain
               complete or generic data-set names, specified as below :

                                        data-set is bypassed.

                    The data-sets names or prefixes must be separated
                    each from the other by at least one blank (maximum
                    is 44 characters long), and they must be always
                    complete within the 72 columns range.
               The purpose is to skip the MOUNT request of a volume
               containing a VSAM-catalog which is needed to locate
               data-sets residing on analyzed volumes (eligibles).
