  Purpose :    This program performs the space distribution (map)
  ---------    analysis on any volume which is a direct-access
               storage device class (UCBTYP+2 is X'20').

               A DD-card, written as below, is needed for each
               volume of which the analysis is desired :

               //VTDD...  DD  UNIT=...,VOLUME=SER=...,DISP=OLD


  Call of the program :
  ---------------------

         //ANAL   EXEC  PGM=VTOCANAL
         //VTDD...  DD  UNIT=...,VOLUME=SER=...,DISP=OLD
         //VTDD...  DD  --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
         //VTDD...  DD  --- any number of DD-cards. ---
         //VTDD...  DD  --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
         //SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=A


  Restriction : be carefull to run this program on volumes which
  ============= are not involved by allocations during the VTOC
                analysis.


  EXEC statement parm. field : options are separated by comma.
  ============================

         N :       suppress the volume VTOC analysis list.

         R :       request to supply the VTOC recovery information
                   if the program finds that any volume space has
                   been lost.

         Q :       use the quick (EXCP full track) method to read
                   the VTOC.
