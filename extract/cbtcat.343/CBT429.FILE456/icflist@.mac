  Purpose :    This program produces a listing of an entire ICF
  ---------    catalog residing on a volume which is a direct-access
               storage device class (UCBTYP+2 = X'20').

               A DD-card, written as below, is needed for each
               catalog on which the analysis is desired :

               //ICDD...  DD  DSN=...ICF catalog...,DISP=SHR


  Call of the program :
  ---------------------

         //LIST   EXEC  PGM=ICFLIST
         //STEPCAT  DD  DSN=...Master catalog...,DISP=SHR
         //ICDD...  DD  DSN=...ICF catalog...,DISP=SHR
         //ICDD...  DD  --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
         //ICDD...  DD  --- Any number of DD-cards. ---
         //ICDD...  DD  --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
         //SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=A

  Remarks : 1. If you try to analyze a VSAM catalog or an O.S. catalog
  ---------    (not ICF), you will receive on output print a message
               of the form :
                   ICFSO (ICDD... ) : RETURN CODE 10.
            2. The STEPCAT DD-card is optional if the first ICF.....
               DD-card refers the master catalog of the running system.
               If not supplied, you will receive the messages :
               a) on job log : IEC161I 076-002,...
               b) on output print : ICFSO (ICDD... ) : RETURN CODE 02.
                                    (R0/R1 : 000000BC/00000008)
               at every ICF..... DD-card until that refering the master
               catalog of the running system.
            3. If you want to analyze only one ICF catalog which is not
               master catalog of the running system, you may do it also
               as shown below :
                   //STEPCAT  DD  DSN=...ICF catalog...,DISP=SHR
                   //ICF...   DD  DSN=...ICF catalog...,DISP=SHR
            4. I didn't search in the IBM Logic manuals about the
               STEPCAT problem described above, but i have discovered
               that it is bypassed if you always duplicates the first
               catalog DD-card as STEPCAT.
