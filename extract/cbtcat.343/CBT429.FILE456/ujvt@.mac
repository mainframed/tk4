  Purpose :    Program to test IEFUJV computations.
  ---------

  Call of the program :
  ---------------------

         //UJVTEX EXEC  PGM=UJVT
         //SYSPUNCH DD  --- (S command) ---
         //SYSLIST  DD  SYSOUT=A
         //SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=A
         //SYSIN    DD  --- (input commands) ---

  Input commands :
  ----------------

  Syntax :     The input commands are free format and may start
               anywhere from column 1 up to column 72 included.
               Commands and operands are separated by at least
               one blank. Multiple commands are accepted, but a
               command must be complete in the 72 columns range.

  Skeleton :   VERB  FROM  TO  BY

               When TO and/or BY operands are omitted, use a
               zero (0) to reset the remaining values if desired,
               otherwise those previously defined are maintained
               for the next computations (G command).

  VERB :       R - set REGION in K.
                   i.e. : R 100 1500 100

               I - set I/O number in thousands.
                   i.e. : I 2 20 2

               T - set CPU TIME in seconds.
                   i.e. : T 10 300 10

               P '...TEXT...' COUNT - skip page setting '...TEXT...'
                   as page header (optional, max. length 50), and
                   clearing the page count with the given value
                   (optional).
                   i.e. : P 'TEST RUN.' 50

               L - output on SYSPRINT only (default).

               C - suspend L or S command, map classes output on
                   SYSPRINT.

               M - suspend L or S command, map performance group
                   numbers output on SYSPRINT.

               X - suspend L or S command, map priorities output
                   on SYSPRINT.

               S - suspend L command, output on SYSPUNCH cards
                   having the following format :

                   col.  4 - 10 : REGION in K.
                        14 - 20 : I/O number in thousands.
                        25 - 30 : CPU TIME in minutes/seconds
                                  (format : MMM,SS).
                        34 - 40 : I/O index value.
                        44 - 50 : weight value.
                             52 : priority.
                             54 = class.
                        56 - 58 = performance group number.

               G - execute computations with values and orders
                   given by the previous verbs.

  Remark : when requesting the map output, remember that the values
           for T and I are respectively taken as X and Y coordinates.
           This means :
           - T is not taken in account if it exceeds the 100 steps
             variation (for each T value, a line position is used to
             store the computed class, performance group number or
             priority).
           - a page overflow occurs if I exceeds about 50 steps
             variation (for each I value, a line is printed).
