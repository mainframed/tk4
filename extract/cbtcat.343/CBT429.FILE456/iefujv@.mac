  Purpose : Control the authorization and programmer number coded
  --------- in the accounting field of the JOB card, prepare the
            time and I/O control for the job, assign the execution
            class and the performance group number to the job.
            SRB time control (job I/O control) : see SMFEXIT@
            documentation for pre-requisites.

  Note : to use installation-defined data-sets with this exit routine,
  ------ you must define them with a DD statement in the Job Entry
         Subsystem cataloged procedure. When running JES2, you must
         also define the data-sets with a DD statement in the initiator
         cataloged procedure. The following DD-cards format must be
         used to access the accounting information data-set :

         1. In the JES2 procedure, into which the catalog cannot be
            referenced when it is started :

                 //SYSACC    DD UNIT=...,VOL=SER=...,DSN=...,DISP=SHR

         2. In the INIT (initiator) procedure :

                 //SYSACC    DD DSN=...,DISP=SHR
            or : //SYSACC    DD UNIT=...,VOL=SER=...,DSN=...,DISP=SHR

  Control suppress :
  ------------------

         1. When using the following DD-card :

               //SYSACC    DD DUMMY

            only the system group accounting numbers are verified,
            and all others are rejected.

         2. If there is no DD-card (SYSACC DDname), only the system
            group accounting numbers are verified, and all others
            are accepted without control (they are just checked for
            a valid accounting field format : 8 numerics).

  Computations tables : all the computations tables used by IEFUJV
  --------------------- are located in a separate module (UJVTABLE).

  JOB statement process :
  -----------------------

         1. Verify the accounting number and supply the box number
            if omitted, unless the account control is suppressed.

         2. The job total I/O's number request (expressed in 1/1000
            I/O) is initialized for IEFUJI exit. An I/O's number
            equal to or larger than 7.200.000 (2 hours in seconds /
            SRB time) means a request to suppress the I/O control,
            but this is exhausted only if the job accounting number
            is authorized, otherwise value 7200 is forced for the job.
            The job total I/O's number request is passed in the field
            JCTUSER0 by JES2 (HASPRDR).
            Exempts : 1. The system and the operator classes are
                         allowed to be exempted from the I/O control
                         for jobs with an authorized accounting number.
                      2. Special task (i.e., ADABAS, IMS, CICS, ...)
                         classes are also exempted when submitted with
                         an authorized accounting number.
                      3. Some predefined class means a job for which
                         all normal computations are performed, but no
                         new class is assigned (i.e., ADABAS-BATCH).
                      4. Special job class assignment (see EXEC, DD and
                         PROC statements process).

         3. Process the TIME parameter if present, TIME=1440 is only
            system tasks and jobs special authorizations allowed.
            If encountered in background or foreground jobs, it is
            changed to a 10 hours value.

         4. Process the REGION parameter if present.

  JOB statement process termination :
  -----------------------------------

         1. Set the job scheduling priority for execution selection.

         2. Set the job execution class.

         3. Prepare the user communication field (Common Exit Parameter
            Area +32) with the job total I/O's number (last two bytes)
            expressed 1/1000 I/O (binary) or zero if the I/O control
            must be inactive.
            This is the way value is passed to IEFUJI exit.

         4. Set the job performance group number (1 to 255 : three
            digits of the PERFORM= keyword builded by the HASP JCL
            Conversion Processor) in the first byte of the JCTUSER0
            field.
            Note : 8 is reserved to operators holding jobs execution.

                                                      IEFUJV    3/3.

  EXEC, DD and PROC statements process :
  --------------------------------------

         Scan it for specific data-set names use, and assign fixed
         class and performance group number to the job if any match,
         unless job name exemption.

  //* comments statement process (CJS) :
  --------------------------------------

         These statements are scanned only to obtain the NET-name
         from an eventual CJS //*NET control card, and store it in
         the words JCTUSER1 and JCTUSER2 for further use by the
         QSP TSO-command.

  Conditional assembly :
  ----------------------

         The IEFUJV source module may produce five different object
    modules depending on the assembly purpose. This selection is done
    setting the assembler SYSPARM(PARM) parameter to one of the
    following values :

         1. EXIT : to generate the IEFUJV SMF exit routine.
                   i.e : SYSPARM(EXIT)
         2. TEST : to generate the routine needed by job TIEFUJVT
                   (contain the IEFUJV JCL statements scan and control
                   part).
                   i.e : SYSPARM(TEST)
         3. CALL : to generate the routine needed by job UJVTEX
                   (contain the IEFUJV computation part).
                   i.e : SYSPARM(CALL)
         4. TSO  : to generate the re-enterable routine needed by the
                   TSO command UJVD (contain the IEFUJV computation
                   part).
                   i.e : SYSPARM(TSO)

         If none is specified (no SYSPARM value), the resulting
    assembly is a dummy IEFUJV routine.

         An external reference is done by IEFUJV to an UJVTABLE module
    which contains all the tables needed for computations (for details
    see UJVTABLE source module).
