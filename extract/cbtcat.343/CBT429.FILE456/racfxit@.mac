  ICHCNX00 : Command pre-processing routine.
  ----------

         Purpose : Users who are not allowed to use RACF for data-sets
                   protection must be avoid from access the ADDSD,
                   ALTDSD, DELDSD and PERMIT commands.

         Method :  A user who don't have the ADSP attribute or the
                   installation data field containing the keyword
                   ALLOWED will be rejected.

         Note :    A user having the ADSP attribute can use the RACF
                   protection commands, and any new created data-set
                   by this user is automatically RACF defined.
                   For a user, without ADSP attribute, but ALLOWED,
                   the new created data-sets are not automatically
                   RACF defined, but he is allowed to do it using the
                   RACF protection commands when he needs it.

  ICHRCX01 : RACHECK pre-processing routine.
  ----------

         Purpose : Establish fast path authorization checking for
                   owners of data-sets.

         Method :  The profile check is bypassed if the request is for
                   DATASET class, with the access not ALTER, and
                   the first level qualifier is the USER-id itself.

  ICHRDSNT : Data-set name table.
