  Purpose : Program (started task) allowing a gracefull shutdown to be
  --------- scheduled for a pre-determined time-of-day by operator.
         The logged on TSO and/or active IMS users are sent messages
         at intervals informing them of the time remaining to shutdown
         one, some or all system services (i.e. - TSO, IMS, ... ).

  Messages : The messages are read from the data-set indicated by
  ---------- the DD-name SYSTMSG (must be fixed 80-byte records).
         The format of the cards containing the desired messages
         must be as follows :
         col.  1   = must be a blank,
         col. 2-66 = the message text (quotes need not be doubled).
         The remaining columns are lost (unused).
         A card containing '-end' in columns 1-4 causes a message
         line of hyphens.
         The messages are sended in the same order they are read.

  Optionally, special cards may be used :
  ---------------------------------------
      1. to request that, once the shutdown messages has been sent
         and the time limit is expired, a command is issued (this
         allows the shutdown processing to start automatically).
         Command card format :
         col. 1-5  = must be '-com ' keyword,
         col. 6-72 = the operator command text.
         Only one command card is accepted, it may be placed anywhere
         (all successives encountered are ignored).
      2. to indicate where the shutdown messages must be sent (users
         destinations).
         Command card format :
         col. 1-4  = must be '-to ' keyword,
         col. 5-72 = the destination keywords TSO and/or IMS.
         If a destination card is not supplied, the shutdown messages,
         by default, are sent to the logged on TSO users only. So a
         '-TO IMS' destination card means to IMS active users only.

  Note : The input is compatible with that of the NOTICE TSO command
  ------ because the cards are skipped when :
         1. any character other than a blank or minus is found in
            column 1,
         2. the character minus is found in column 1 but
            A. the contents of columns 2-4 is not 'end', or
            B. the contents of columns 2-5 is not 'com ', or
            C. the contents of columns 2-4 is not 'to '.
         All the cards can be lower/UPPER cases.

                                                      SHUTDOWN  2/3.

  PARM field description : PARM='AT=HH.MM'  (the Time-of-Day : TOD)
  ------------------------  or
                           PARM='IN=MM'     (an elapsed time from the
                                             current Time-of-Day)
           where : HH.MM or H.MM is the desired shutdown Time-of-Day
                   (format is : Hours.Minutes). By default (omitted),
                   it is assumed 20 minutes elapsed time from the
                   current Time-of-Day.
              or : MM is the desired elapsed time (in Minutes, minimum
                   is 2 and maximum 60) from the current Time-of-Day.
         Note - AT= and IN= keywords are mutually exclusives, but
                PARM='AT=,IN=MM' or PARM='AT=HH.MM,IN=' is accepted.
                Keywords must be always separated by a comma.
         When the difference between the current TOD and the desired
         shutdown TOD is more than 30 minutes, the START command is
         re-scheduled to JES2 as below
                   $TA,T=HH.MM,'$VS,''S SHUTDOWN,...'' '
         with HH.MM set as wake-up time on about 30 minutes before the
         desired shutdown TOD.

  Time intervals : The interval time to send warning messages is
  ---------------- determined automatically by the program using
                   the remaining shutdown time as follows :
                   - each 5 minutes for a remaining time from 30 to
                     10 minutes.
                   - each 1 minute for a remaining time from 10 to 5
                     minutes.
                   - each 30 seconds for a remaining time of 5 or less
                     minutes.

  Additional facilities :
  -----------------------
         1. When started task running, the shutdown process may be
            stoped or changed at any time through the STOP (P "name")
            or MODIFY (F "name",...) operator commands, where :
               "name" is the started task job-name, and
               ... is the desired new PARM field value.
            I.E. - Assuming the started task job-name is SHUTDOWN :
                   Modify : F SHUTDOWN,AT=17.00
                   Stop : P SHUTDOWN
            Note - A MODIFY with no text is like a null PARM field
                   value, and thus allows another 20 minutes.
         2. The program enter a simulation test mode when not started
            task executing (it use the DD-name SYSLMSG as output).
            This allows operator to check a shutdown process.
