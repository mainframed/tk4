  Purpose :    This program produces a listing of an entire O.S.
  ---------    catalog (data-set SYSCTLG) residing on a volume
               which is a direct-access storage device class
               (UCBTYP+2 = X'20').

               A DD-card, written as below, is needed for each
               volume on which the analysis is desired :

               //CTDD...  DD  UNIT=...,VOLUME=SER=...,DISP=OLD


  Call of the program :
  ---------------------

         //LIST   EXEC  PGM=CATLIST
         //CTDD...  DD  UNIT=...,VOLUME=SER=...,DISP=OLD
         //CTDD...  DD  --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
         //CTDD...  DD  --- Any number of DD-cards. ---
         //CTDD...  DD  --- --- --- --- --- --- --- ---
         //SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=A


  Restriction : be carefull to run this program on volumes which
  ------------- are not involved by O.S. catalog operations during
                the list.
