  Purpose :
  =========

         This program can be used to initialize 9-tracks tapes at 800,
  1600 or 6250 bpi. It offers a more flexible way to prepare the tapes
  for O.S. work than the IEHINITT program of I.B.M. do.

  Syntax :
  ========

         The control statement(s) can be accepted from three different
  input sources (input stream, O.S. MODIFY command or operator's reply)
  selectable at the job level. A control statement is composed of one
  or more connands involving one or more tapes initialization. The
  statements, and thus commands, are free format (no fixed columns or
  positions). Each command is separated from the next in a statement
  by a slash character (/), and a command cannot continue on a new
  statement.

  Commands description :
  ======================

    1. SL DDD . XXXXXX  : initialize tape standard label with the
                          volume serial number XXXXXX at density DDD,
                          where DDD is 800, 1600 or 6250.
                          (If DDD is omitted, the default density
                          used by the program is 6250).

    2. SL DDD . AAAAAA, BBBBBB, ... , ZZZZZZ : initialize a list of
                          tapes standard labels with the volume serial
                          numbers AAAAAA, BBBBBB, until ZZZZZZ at
                          density DDD.
                          (The tapes are called in serial mounting,
                          one after the other).

    3. SL DDD . AANNNN - XX : initialize XX tapes standard labels with
                          the generated volume serial numbers from
                          AANNNN and incremented each time by +1.
                          (The digits where occurs the addition must
                          be numerics of course).

         All these three command formats can be also applied to NL
         (no label) tapes by replacing SL by NL.

         The END command is used to stop the program execution, and
         thus is normally the last.

                                                      SLABEL    2/2.

         The two statement examples given below are self-explanatories
         to describe how the commands can be mixed.

         Statement 1 :

         SL6250.EU0000,EU1001-20,EU2000/SL1600.EU3000/NL.EU4000-50

         Statement 2 :

         NL800.EU5000,EU6000/SL1600.EU7000-10/SL800.EU8000/END

  Note : The program initializes the tapes using only one physical
  ------ tape unit (this is allocated by the SYSUTL DD-card), and
         consequently, be carefull when mixing densities requests,
         so that the tape unit support it.

  Call of the program :
  =====================

    1. Entry by input stream :
    --------------------------

         //INITTAPE JOB ... ... ...
         //INIT    EXEC PGM=SLABEL
         //SYSUTL    DD UNIT=(HTAPE,,DEFER),VOL=(PRIVATE),LABEL=(,BLP)
         //SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=A
         //SYSIN     DD *
           ...
           ... the statements can be placed anywhere in the cards,
           ...          from column 1 to column 72 included.
           ...
         /*

    2. Entry by operator's reply :
    ------------------------------

         //INITTAPE JOB ... ... ...
         //INIT    EXEC PGM=SLABEL,PARM=0
         //SYSUTL    DD UNIT=(HTAPE,,DEFER),VOL=(PRIVATE),LABEL=(,BLP)

         At the execution time, the program calls the operator to
         reply with a statement from the main console.

    3. Entry by O.S. MODIFY command :
    ---------------------------------

         //INITTAPE JOB ... ... ...
         //INIT    EXEC PGM=SLABEL,PARM=1
         //SYSUTL    DD UNIT=(HTAPE,,DEFER),VOL=(PRIVATE),LABEL=(,BLP)

         At the execution time, the program calls the operator to
         supply the statements through the O.S. MODIFY (F) command.
