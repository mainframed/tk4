 Basic information about the Accounting :
 ----------------------------------------

     All users are assigned one or more accounting number(s) before
 they can access our computers installation for work. This allows them
 to execute batch jobs or interactive processes (i.e., TSO, IMS, ...).

     The account number (8 numerics) is composed of two items : the
 authorization number (4 numerics, 0001 to 9999), and the programmer
 number (4 numerics, 0001 to 9999).

     All the existing and valid account numbers are memorized in a
 special Accounting Information data-set, which must be created,
 builded or maintained with the set of programs or TSO commands
 facilities listed below :
          AIDINIT  : creation and initialization program.
          AIDLOAD  : data-set load contents program.
          AIDSYNC  : data-set synchronization program.
          AIDUNLD  : data-set unload contents program.
          LTACC    : data-set contents list program.
          AUT...   : data-set contents management TSO commands.

     Because of the special internal structure of this data-set, any
 work to be done into it must be executed through the use of routines
 packages (included at the link-edit time) :
          YPACK    : short package manipulation.
          ZPACK    : full package manipulation.
          ZYDIAG   : packages diagnostics help.

     This data-set is involved at any start of batch works (jobs) or
 interactive processes (Logon of TSO sessions) for control purpose by
 "IEFUJV" SMF job validation exit, so it must be defined in JES2 and
 INIT starting procedures (SYS1.PROCLIB).

                                                      AIDINIT   2/3.

  Purpose :    This program initializes the accounting information
  ---------    data-set accordingly to the dummy section described
               by the macro $AIRD.

  Call of the program :
  ---------------------

         //INACC  EXEC  PGM=AIDINIT,PARM=...(optional)...
         //SYSACC   DD  UNIT=...,VOL=SER=...,DSN=...,
                        SPACE=(TRK,(...),,CONTIG),DISP=(NEW,CATLG)
                               CYL
            or :

         //SYSACC   DD  DSN=...,DISP=OLD
                                     SHR
         //SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=A

         PARM=DUMP : dump requested when an error is detected.
                     It can be used to obtain a dump (abend U0001)
                     when debugging the program (SYSUDUMP or SYSABEND
                     DD-card needed).

  Note - The key (argument or index) length is assumed to be two
  ----   bytes (halfword) long, and may or not be included in the
         accounting information record (macro $AIRD).

       - When assigning the data-set space, no secondary allocation
         is accepted, and it must be cataloged.

       - If the data-set is OLD, the program requests a confirm
         reply to the operator before starting the initialization
         unless it is an owner data-set.

       - If the data-set is OLD and the block-size does not match
         the assembled accounting record length (macro $AIRD), the
         data-set must be deleted and then reallocated.

  Data-set organization :
  -----------------------

               The data-set is a direct-access organization, but
         divided in four different sections as described below :

         1. The records in the range 0 to 19997 are normally direct
            accessed and they correspond to the following accounting
            information : 0001 to 9999 authorization's numbers, and
                          0001 to 9999 programmer's numbers.

         2. The records from 19998 to 19998+(N-1) are used to
            store the keys (arguments or indexes) table refering
            to the next section.

         3. The records from 19998+N to END-X (the end of the
            data-set space minus the number of records necessary
            to the map table) are destinated to other accounting
            information (i.e. - activities or contracts, and
            services descriptions).

         4. The last X records are reserved to a bit map table
            necessary to indicate the presence or absence of
            the corresponding authorization number record (see
            section 1).

  Data-set search strategy.
  -------------------------

               For the keys (arguments or indexes) from 1 to
         19999 the program access directly the data records
         (section 1 of the data-set), and for keys from 20000,
         the program scan the keys table (section 2 of the
         data-set) to find the corresponding physical address
         of the data records (section 3 of the data-set).
         The bit map table (section 4 of the data-set) is used
         to gain time when it is requested to read the AUT. or
         PRG. numbers records (section 1 of the data-set) in
         a sequential mode. It allows to skip the undefined
         records (no data) without reading it in core storage.

  List of contents : when the data-set is builded, a list of
  ------------------ authorizations and programmers can be
                     obtained using the LTACC program.

  I/O routines : the following packages are available to access and
  -------------- manage the information in the accounting data-set :
                      YPACK  : short I/O package.
                      ZPACK  : full I/O package.
                      ZYDIAG : diagnostics aids.
