  Purpose :    Supply diagnostics text for error number returned by
  ---------    ZPACK and YPACK routines packages. It is then caller
               responsability to print out the message.

  Calling sequence : CALL ZYDIAG,(A,B,C),VL
  -------------------            (A,B)
                                 (A)

         Where : A - is the address of the indicator response (format
                     FULLWORD - F boundary) returned by ZPACK or YPACK
                     routines packages. If the address of this argument
                     is set to zero in the parameters list, or the
                     parameters list pointer (register 1) is zero,
                     the indicator response value is assumed to be
                     in the register 0. At exit of the routine, if
                     the arguments B and C are omitted, the register
                     15 points on the diagnostic text as below :

                                    DC  AL1(L'TEXT)
                     R15 ---> TEXT  DC  C'0...diagnostic...'

                     Note that the first character is the ASA control
                     character 0 (zero) for double space, and the
                     length of the diagnostic text is in the one
                     byte located at the address minus one.

                 B - is the eventual address of an area where the
                     diagnostic text (format CL...) is moved. If
                     the C argument is omitted, the length of the
                     diagnostic text is placed in the one byte
                     located at the address minus one of B argument
                     address (all messages are less than 80 characters
                     long). At exit of the routine, the register 15
                     is zero.

                 C - receives the length of the diagnostic text
                     (format FULLWORD - F boundary) if supplied
                     (optional argument).
