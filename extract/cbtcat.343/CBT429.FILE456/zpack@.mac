  Purpose :    This is the full operational package available
  ---------    to maintain and manage data in the accounting
               information data-set, which is accessed through
               a DD-card coded as below :

               //SYSACC   DD  DSN=...,DISP=SHR
                                           OLD

         Note : the key (argument or index) length is assumed to
                be two bytes (halfword) long, and may or not be
                included in the accounting information record.

  MVS/XA :     Must be AMODE and RMODE 24.

  Calling sequence : CALL ZOPEN,(A,B),VL
  ------------------            (A)

         Where : A - is the address of the indicator response (format
                     FULLWORD - F boundary). Value is always placed
                     in register 15 and can be :
                     0 (zero) - the data-set is correctly opened.
                     + (positive) - error number. The data-set is
                                    not opened.

                 B - is the address of an eventual keyword (format CL4)
                     as below :
                     DUMP to request a dump on error detected by the
                          routines (SYSUDUMP or SYSABEND DD-card is
                          needed). This option is effective until the
                          close, and the error number is set as abend
                          code.
                     ONLY to bypass the exclusive ENQUEUE of the data-
                          set when these routines are used only in read
                          (no updates take place). So the ZWRITE and
                          ZDELET are disabled.
                     BOTH to have both previous actions.

                     0 (zero) - the data record is correctly read or
                                written.

  ------------------

         Where : A - is the address of the indicator response (format
                     FULLWORD - F boundary). Value is always placed

                     in register 15 and can be :
                     0 (zero) - the data record is correctly read.
                     + (positive) - error number.
                     -1 (minus one) - end of data (END-OF-FILE).

                 B - is the address of the data record area (format
                     CL... - see macro $AIRD for length).

                 C - is the address of the argument, optional (format
                     HALFWORD - H boundary). When used it receives
                     the current argument.

                     in register 15 and can be :
                     0 (zero) - the data record is correctly deleted.
                     + (positive) - error number.

                 B - is the address of the argument (format HALFWORD -
                     H boundary).

  Important note : when using this package, if any ZWRITE or ZDELET
  ---------------- operations has been done, it is necessary and
                   mandatory to terminate with the ZCLOSE, unless the
                   Bit Map table may not reflect the updates to the
                   data-set (see AIDINIT : data-set organization).
