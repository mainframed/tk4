  Purpose :    The main goals of the Assembler Macros References
  ---------    Utility program is to create a list (book) which
               quickly responds to the following two funny questions :
               1) which macros are used in a specific Assembler
                  symbolic module ? or
               2) which Assembler symbolic modules in your sources
                  libraries use a specific macro ?

  Call of the program :
  ---------------------

         //XEQ     EXEC PGM=AMRUTIL,PARM='...(Optional)...'
         //MAC...    DD DSN=...1st Macros Library...,DISP=SHR
         //MAC...    DD DSN=...2nd Macros library...,DISP=SHR
                            ...any number of DD-cards...
         //MAC...    DD DSN=...nth Macros Library...,DISP=SHR
         //SRC...    DD DSN=...1st Sources Library...,DISP=SHR
         //SRC...    DD DSN=...2nd Sources Library...,DISP=SHR
                            ...any number of DD-cards...
         //SRC...    DD DSN=...nth Sources Library...,DISP=SHR
         //TITPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*,DCB=(RECFM=FBA,BLKSIZE=800,LRECL=80)
         //MACPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*,DCB=(RECFM=FBA,BLKSIZE=800,LRECL=80)
         //SRCPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*,DCB=(RECFM=FBA,BLKSIZE=800,LRECL=80)
         //SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*

  JCL additional information :
  ----------------------------

  1. Maintaining the order of the three DD-cards TITPRINT, MACPRINT
     and SRCPRINT allows you to print in the right order the entire
     generated manual.
  2. Place the //MAC... DD-cards in the same order they are normally
     concatenated to the //SYSLIB DD-card as when you execute the
     assembly of the sources modules.
  3. Repeat a //MAC... DD-card as a //SRC... DD-card if you want to
     know the inner-outer macros use.
  4. All //MAC... DD-cards and //SRC... DD-cards must refer only to
     partitioned data-sets.

  Defaults :   The program assumes some execution defaults values.
  ----------   These are defined by symbols as below :
         LN :   55 is the maximum number of lines per page
         MD :   10 is the maximum number of Macros Libraries DDs
                   (//MAC... DD ...)
         SD :   10 is the maximum number of Sources Libraries DDs
                   (//SRC... DD ...)
         MM : 1000 is the maximum number of members names for all the
                   Macros Libraries
         SM : 2000 is the maximum number of members names for all the
                   Sources Libraries
         RN : 5000 is the maximum number of reference elements (a
                   reference element is used to set the number of
                   times a macro appears in a source module, obviously
                   not all macros are in all modules)
         IM :  100 is the maximum number of internal macros definitions
                   in a source module
         UM : 1000 is the maximum number of unresolved macros
                   encountered in a source module
         CM :   50 is the maximum number of copy module names (not
                   statememts) in a source module
         OC :  500 is the maximum number of operation codes defined in
                   member GIMOPCDE (SYS1.PARMLIB)
         All these values can be changed through the EXEC PARM= field
         in the JCL.

  EXEC parm. field : Use to overrides any or all execution defaults
  ------------------ values. They may be specified in any order as
         shown below :
         PARM='LN=60,MM=500,SD=5,MD=5,...etc...'
         or :
         PARM='LN 60 MM 500 SD 5 MD 5 ...etc...'
         Blanks and commas are treated as separators, so you may
         code : PARM='LN=60,MD=5 ...
         or mixed : PARM=' LN 60 , MD = 5 ...
         A TRACE option (gives information about all work-areas spaces
         dynamically obtained/used by the program, about 1 page on
         SYSPRINT) may be also specified in the EXEC parm. field by
         just setting T.
         i.e. : PARM=T or PARM='LN 60 T'
         This option can help you to estimate and set the REGION size
         in your JCL.

  Remarks : 1. As soon as the program discover a non Assembler source
  ---------    statement (as i.e. a // JCL card) the corresponding
               module analysis is terminated (flushed). So, don't
               set any JCL with the assembly source in the same member,
               but set it in a separate member.
            2. The COPY statement (to include sources or macros) is
               rudimentarily processed (you are only informed about
               all the COPY names in a source module).
            3. Generally the program works well, but some exceptional
               situation may occur where macros use escape, as shown
               in the very simple example below :
                             MACRO
                    &NAME    MAC1  &OP,&N
                    &NAME    &OP   &N
                             MEND
               then, if this macro is coded in the source as follows :
                    AB100    MAC1  ABEND,100
               it generates the statement :
                    AB100    ABEND 100
               and ,sorry, but the macro ABEND will not be detected in
               this case.
