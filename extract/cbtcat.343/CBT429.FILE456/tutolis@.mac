  Purpose :    Produce a list of the tutorials from the ISPF-panels.
  ---------

  JCL :  //LIST    EXEC PGM=TUTOLIST,PARM=...
  -----  //SYSPDS    DD DSN=...ISPF panels library...,DISP=SHR
         //SYSINDEX  DD ...index data-set output if requested...
         //SYSPRINT  DD ...list data-set output...
         //SYSIN     DD ...input data-set (control cards)...

  CONTROL cards :
  ---------------

     1 - Header cards : must contain '*HDR ' in columns 1 to 5 followed
            by a header text (columns 6 up to 72 maximum). An index
            header card ('*HIX ') is also allowed as input control card
            when the general index is requested (PARM=I is specified),
            and it must be encountered before any panels names cards
            unless it is not considered.
     2 - Manual Name card : must contain '*MNT ' in columns 1 to 5
            followed by a manual name text (columns 6 up to 72
            maximum). This control card must be encountered before
            any panels names cards unless it is not considered.
     3 - Variables names cards : must contain '*VAR ' in columns 1 to
            5 followed by the panels variables names which must be
            eliminated in the list. The names may be coded into cards
            columns 6 up to 72 included, and they must be separated
            from each other by at least one blank. A name must stay
            entirely in a card (do not split it in two cards).
     4 - Replace text cards : must contain '*REP ' in columns 1 to 5
            followed by the text match string and the text replacement
            string. The text strings must be enclosed into apostrophes
            (if an apostrophe is part of the text, it must be doubled).
            If the replacement string is not specified, it is asumed as
            a null string. Only one replacement is accepted by card.
     5 - Panels names cards : variable coded into cards columns 1 to 72
            included, the names must be separated from each other by at
            least one blank. A name must stay entirely in a card (do
            not split it in two cards).
     6 - Reset cards : must contain '*RZV ' or '*RZR ' in columns 1 to
            5 and are used to reset respectively all variables names or
            replace texts previously defined through the corresponding
            control cards.

                                                      TUTOLIST  2/2.

  PARM field : Parameters can be specified in any order, but must be
  ------------ separated from each other by a comma.
               N - may be used to have the panel names in the list.
               I - to obtain a general index (at each header card
                   the corresponding page number).

  CLIST purpose : A CLIST named TUTGEN has been developed to help in
  --------------- preparing the input for the TUTOLIST program.
          Skeleton : %TUTGEN DSN(...) MEM(...) OUTDSN(...) OUTMEM(...)
          Arguments : DSN - the ISPF-panels library name.
                      MEM - the starting tutorial panel name.
                      OUTDSN - the private output library name (must
                            be a PO data-set and already existing).
                      OUTMEM - the output member name (TUTOLIST
                            program input). This can be edited to
                            add control cards if desired.

  EXAMPLE :    Here follows a job which, if executed, will give you
  ---------    the ISPF - BROWSE manual from the tutorial panels.

          1. Execute the CLIST :

            %TUTGEN DSN(...ISPF panels library...) MEM(ISR10000) -
                    OUTDSN(...private library...) OUTMEM(TUTOBRWS)

          2. SUBMIT the job below :

            //...  JOB ...
            //LIST    EXEC PGM=TUTOLIST,PARM='N,I'
            //SYSPDS    DD DSN=...ISPF panels library...,DISP=SHR
            //SYSINDEX  DD SYSOUT=*
            //SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*
            //SYSIN     DD DSN=...private library...(TUTOBRWS),DISP=SHR

          I.E. some other manuals :
          -------------------------
            %TUTGEN DSN(...ISPF panels library...) MEM(ISR20000) -
                    OUTDSN(...private library...) OUTMEM(TUTOEDIT)
            %TUTGEN DSN(...ISPF panels library...) MEM(ISR30000) -
                    OUTDSN(...private library...) OUTMEM(TUTOUTIL)
            %TUTGEN DSN(...ISPF panels library...) MEM(ISR70000) -
                    OUTDSN(...private library...) OUTMEM(TUTOTEST)
            %TUTGEN DSN(...ISPF panels library...) MEM(ICHT0) -
                    OUTDSN(...private library...) OUTMEM(TUTORACF)
