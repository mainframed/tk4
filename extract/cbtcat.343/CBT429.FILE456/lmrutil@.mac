  Purpose :    The main goals of the Load Modules References Utility
  ---------    program is to create a list (book) which quickly
               responds to the following two funny questions :
               1) which routines are used in a specific load module ?
                  or
               2) which load modules in your load libraries use a
                  specific routine ?

  Call of the program :
  ---------------------

         //XEQ     EXEC PGM=LMRUTIL,PARM='...(Optional)...'
         //LML...    DD DSN=...1st Load Library...,DISP=SHR
         //LML...    DD DSN=...2nd Load Library...,DISP=SHR
                            ...any number of DD-cards...
         //LML...    DD DSN=...nth Load Library...,DISP=SHR
         //TITPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*,DCB=(RECFM=FBA,BLKSIZE=800,LRECL=80)
         //LMLPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*,DCB=(RECFM=FBA,BLKSIZE=800,LRECL=80)
         //SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*

  JCL additional information :
  ----------------------------

  1. Maintaining the order of the two DD-cards TITPRINT and LMLPRINT
     allows you to print in the right order the entire generated
     manual.
  2. All //LML... DD-cards must refer only to load modules partitioned
     libraries data-sets.
  3. Only load modules builded by the Linkage Editor are analyzed.

  Defaults :   The program assumes some execution defaults values.
  ----------   These are defined by symbols as below :
         LN :   55 is the maximum number of lines per page
         MD :   10 is the maximum number of Load Libraries DDs
                   (//LML... DD ...)
         MM : 3000 is the maximum number of directories names in all
                   Load Libraries
         RN : 8000 is the maximum number of reference elements in all
                   Load Libraries (a reference element is used for :
                        - the MODULE name of a load module,
                        - each ALIAS name of a load module,
                        - each ENTRY name (unless it is MODULE or
                          ALIAS name) in a load module, and
                        - each EXTERNAL name in a load module)
         ZP : 3000 is the maximum number of HMASPZAP IDR's in all Load
                   Modules of all Load Libraries
         LK : 3000 is the maximum number of Linkage Editor IDR's in all
                   Load Modules of all Load Libraries
         US : 3000 is the maximum number of User (IDENTIFY) IDR's in
                   all Load Modules of all Libraries
         CE :  500 is the maximum number of CESD symbols defined in one
                   Load Module
         TW :    4 is the maximum number of K (1024 bytes) for the
                   Translator IDR's work buffer
         UW :    4 is the maximum number of K (1024 bytes) for User
                   (IDENTIFY) IDR's work buffer
         All these values can be changed through the EXEC PARM= field
         in the JCL.

  EXEC parm. field : Use to overrides any or all execution defaults
  ------------------ values. They may be specified in any order as
         shown below :
         PARM='LN=60,MM=5000,MD=5,RN=20000'
         or :
         PARM='LN 60 MM 5000 MD 5 RN 20000'
         Blanks and commas are treated as separators, so you may
         code : PARM='LN=60,MD=5 ...
         or mixed : PARM=' LN 60 , MD = 5 ...
         A TRACE option (gives information about all work-areas spaces
         dynamically obtained/used by the program, about 1 page on
         SYSPRINT) may be also specified in the EXEC parm. field by
         just setting T.
         i.e. : PARM=T or PARM='LN 60 T'
         This option can help you to estimate and set the REGION size
         in your JCL.
