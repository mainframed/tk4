  Purpose :
  ---------

         1. The SRB time limit (number of I/O operations in thousands),
            if supplied and passed through the user communication field
            (Common Exit Parameter Area +32) by the IEFUJV exit, is set
            in the ASCB. When zero, no SRB timing is performed.

         2. Re-evaluation of the job time limit (would be the job CPU
            time requested) if needed.

  SRB time evaluation :
  ---------------------

         One (1) second of SRB time is equivalent to the execution of
         thousand (1000) I/O operations (in the worst case), but this
         is CPU dependent, and the real SRB time may vary with trace
         on or off, access method and/or programming language used
         (i.e., the assembler is normally more than twice faster).

  CPU time evaluation :
  ---------------------

         In a complex of computers, often all of these are not the
         same model and thus not same CPU speed. To reflect this
         situation, a system speed factor is applied to the job CPU
         time in order to extend it in correspondence to the fastest
         system in the complex.

  Note : See assembler macro $SIDTB (SIDIO and SIDCPU tables) for
  ------ systems apply factors.

  Conditional assembly :
  ----------------------

         The IEFUJI source module may produce different object modules
    depending on the assembly purpose. This selection is done setting
    the assembler SYSPARM(PARM) parameter to the following value :

            PARM - TEST : may be used for debugging purpose.
                       Only when a predefined job-name matches, display
                       the addresses of the JCT and SCT, the job time
                       limit and the maximum step running time (should
                       be that of the first job step).
                   by default : re-evaluation of the job time limit if
                       needed.
