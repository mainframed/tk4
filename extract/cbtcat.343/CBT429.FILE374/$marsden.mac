Sam,

I've redone the SAS file as sas1.exe which is attached.

sas2.exe is an additional small collection of SAS programs to read
Huron v2 / Object Star v3 SMF.

Also redone the zdf file to add a little more documentation and
remove one line from one program that indicated it might not be for
public distribution.

All 3 files are zipped up transmit format now and the PDSs they
represent all have $$docm members and $$author members with my
personal details.  The documentation is minimal unfortunately but
those who might be interested should be able to get the programs
working  - not that difficult if you have familiarity with SAS (or
assembler for ZDF).

Cheers .

David Marsden
