SAS PROGRAMS TO READ SMF MAINLY.
USEFUL IF YOU DON'T HAVE MXG AND WANT TO DO YOUR OWN.
YOU NEED THE IBM SMF MANUAL TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS BEING READ. IF YOU
CANNOT LOCATE A COPY THERE ARE VERSIONS ON THE WEB YOU CAN FREELY
ACCESS.

THE TECHNIQUE OF USING THE TRIPLETS (OFFSET, LENGTH, NUMBER) TO GET
REPEATING DATA HAS CAUSED MUCH GRIEF TO THOSE WHO WANT TO READ SMF
USING COBOL ETC.

MANY OF THESE WERE WRITTEN YEARS AGO AND MAY REQUIRE SOME WORK TO GET
THEM UP TO DATE - BUT SMF IS GENERALLY UPWARD COMPATIBLE.
THUS THEY ARE MOST LIKELY TO BE WRONG IN SO FAR AS THEY MISS THE STUFF
THAT HAS BEEN ADDED AT THE END OR IN THE GAPS THAT ARE SOMETIMES LEFT.

SOME OTHER NON-SMF JOBS, USING CODE AS SUPPLIED BY SAS AS EXAMPLES TO
READ DISK VTOCS , PDS DIRECTORIES.
