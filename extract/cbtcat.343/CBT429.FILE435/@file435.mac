//***FILE 435 is from David North of Los Angeles, California        *
//*           and is a Fixed Blocked LRECL=80 conversion of         *
//*           Frank Clarke's REXX execs that are on File 433.       *
//*           Frank's execs are in VB-255 format.                   *
//*                                                                 *
//*           This conversion was performed with David North's      *
//*           utilities that are on File 155.  After the            *
//*           conversion, the execs were still in VB-255 format,    *
//*           but the lines were folded so they fit into an         *
//*           80-byte width.  I copied the members over to an       *
//*           actual FB-80 dataset.  (SG - 11/99)                   *
