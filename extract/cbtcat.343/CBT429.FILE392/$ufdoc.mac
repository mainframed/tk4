SHARE CODE - UF


THIS VERSION OF QUEUE WAS DERIVED FROM FILE 278 OF THE CBT MODS TAPE,
WHICH HAD BEEN OBTAINED FROM VERSION 18 OF THE SHARE JES2 PROJECT TAPE.

UF001  ALLOW QUEUE COMMAND TO ASSEMBLE USING NJE3.1 SOURCE CODE.
       A FEW EQUATES AND ADDITIONAL DSECTS WERE INCLUDED, WHICH SHOULD
       BE OK FOR NON-NJE SOURCE AS WELL.

UF002  ALLOW QCOMMON TO BE LINKED IN FOR TESTING.
       WE RUN WITH SEVERAL DIFFERENT SPOOL PACK FORMATS DURING TEST,
       AND IT IS CONVENIENT TO HAVE MULTIPLE VERSIONS OF QUEUE TO
       SUPPORT THESE DIFFERENT TEST VERSIONS.
       IT IS ALSO MUCH SIMPLER TO RUN UNDER TSO TEST.

UF003  SUPPORT FOR 3278 MODELS 2, 4, AND 5.
       WE HAVE A WIDE ASSORTMENT OF TERMINALS IN-HOUSE, SO QUEUE WAS
       MODIFIED TO SUPPORT ALL TERMINAL TYPES AS BASIC MODEL 2, AND
       TO ALLOW THE USER TO SWITCH TO THE LARGER SCREEN FORMAT AT ANY
       TIME DURING HIS SESSION.
       THIS CODE IS CURRENTLY RUNNING UNDER ACF/VTAM REL 2, BUT WAS
       DEVELOPED UNDER ACF/VTAM REL 1, AND HAS ALSO RUN WITH TCAM AT
       THE 8011 LEVEL.

UF004  ADD A TITLE CARD FOR Q0 (QCOMMON).

UF005  DO NOT CHECK FOR JOBNAME MATCHING TSO LOGON ID IF QXAUTH=1.
       ALSO ALLOW READING DSID'S LESS THAN 101 IF QXAUTH=1.
       DSID'S LESS THAN 101 ARE SOMETIMES USEFUL TO LOOK AT;  THE
       INTERNAL TEXT FILE MAKES IT EASIER TO LOCATE THE PROPPER DSID
       IN A SYSGEN WHERE ALL STEPNAMES ARE "ASM", AND IN A VM NETWORK
       ENVIRONMENT IT IS COMMON TO HAVE OUTPUT DSID'S OF 1.

UF006  ONLY READ THE CHECKPOINT IF THE INFORMATION IS NEEDED.
       THE READ OF THE CHECKPOINT IS REMOVED FROM THE MAIN EXECUTION
       LOOP, SINCE IT IS REALLY SILLY TO READ A LARGE CHECKPOINT DATASET
       WHEN THE USER COMMAND IS TO JUST REPOSTITION WITHIN THE CURRENT
       FILE.

UF007  CHANGE COMMANDS "DD *" AND "L * DSID" TO USE THE LAST JOBNAME
       IF A "*" IS SPECIFIED.  THIS MAKES IT EASIER TO TYPE, AND CODE
       IS ADDED TO SKIP THE CHECKPOINT READ FOR PERFORMANCE REASONS.

UF008  HAVE THE FINDPDDB ROUTINE START AT THE FIRST IOT IF PDDB IS NOT
       FOUND.  A MIXTURE OF SPIN AND REGULAR PDDB'S USED TO CAUSE
       THE ROUTINE TO SCAN TO THE END OF THE IOT'S AND STAY THERE WHILE
       TRYING TO LOCATE THE FIRST REGULAR PDDB AFTER A SPUN ONE.

UF009  ADD SYNAD ROUTINE AND ADDITIONAL CHECKING TO READSPC ROUTINE SO
       THAT THE SYSTEM WILL NOT FAIL DURING XB PROCESSING.

UF010  IF USER IS HAS TSO OPERATOR AUTHORITY, SET FLAG BIT IN QFLAG1,
       AND FORCE QXAUTH ON.

UF011  ADD MODULE HEXDUMP (Q28) WHICH WILL GENERATE AN ABEND FORMAT
       DUMP OF THE DATA PASSED TO IT.

UF012  CHANGE HEXBLK (Q9) TO USE HEXDUMP FOR FORMATTING THE READ
       BUFFER.

UF013  CHANGE HEXBLK (Q9) TO ALLOW ADDITIONAL INPUT PARAMETERS FOR
       DUMPING CURRENT BLOCK, AND OFFSETS INTO THE REQUESTED BLOCK.
       IF THE BLOCK ADDRESS PARAMETER IS "+", THE BUFFER CHAINED FROM
       THE CURRENT BUFFER WILL BE DUMPED.

UF014  CHANGE PARSE (Q16) TO USE 4 CHARACTER COMMAND NAMES, AND
       CHANGE LOGIC FOR DETERMINING IF A COMMAND IN PRIVILEGED.

UF015  ADD MODULE CJQE (Q29) TO DUMP JQE IN HEX.

UF016  ADD MODULE CJCT (Q30) TO DUMP JCT IN HEX WITH OPTIONAL
       OFFSET SPECIFIED.

UF017  ADD MODULE CTSO (Q31) TO ALLOW ANY TSO COMMAND TO BE ISSUED
       WHILE IN QUEUE.
       NOTE:  THIS SHOULE NOT BE DONE IF QUEUE IS RUN AUTHORIZED.

UF018  CHANGE DEFAULT STARTUP COMMAND TO "HELP" SO GET STARTED FASTER.

UF019  ALLOW SYSPARM TO CHANGE &QXXX DEFAULTS.

UF020  SUPPORT FOR SP2 LEVEL OF JES2.
       NOTE: THERE ARE PROBABLY SOME BUGS IN THE DISPLAY COMMANDS AT
             THIS LEVEL.  THEY ARE BEING FIXED AS THEY ARE DISCOVERED,
             BUT SINCE THE NERDC DOES NOT NORMALLY USE THESE COMMANDS,
             IT MAY TAKE SOME TIME TO DISCOVER THE ERRORS.
             ONE KNOWN ERROR IS IN SEARCH (Q20) - ONLY JOES FOR OUTPUT
             ROUTED TO LOCAL WILL BE DISPLAYED.  (THE JOT NOW CONTAINS
             A PAIR OF POINTERS FOR EACH SYSOUT CLASS, ONE FOR LOCAL,
             THE OTHER FOR REMOTE OUTPUT.  ONLY THE FIRST ONE IS BEING
             PROCESSED AT THIS TIME.)
             IT ALSO APPEARS THAT THERE ARE ALSO SOME OTHER BUGS IN
             THE SEARCH ROUTINE WHERE SOME OF THE OUTPUT QUEUES ARE
             NOT BEING SEARCHED AT ALL.

UF021  SUPPORT FOR SP2 PTF UZ52546 (8110 LEVEL SET).

UF022  ADD MODULE CHCT (Q32) TO DUMP HCT CHECKPOINTED AREA.
