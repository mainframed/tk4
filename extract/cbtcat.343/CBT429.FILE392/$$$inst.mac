#  The standard SHARE mods disclaimer applies.  I am using this       #
#  program.  It mostly works.  If it doesn't work for you, oh well.   #
#  You can let me know, and I *may* try to fix it.  There are a lot   #
#  of known bugs, but I haven't time recently to try to fix them.     #
#  There are also a number of features which are not complete and/or  #
#  have bugs.  I am continually improving QUEUE (fixing bugs, adding  #
#  features, adding new bugs.)  I therefore request that I get a      #
#  copy of any fixes/additions which are made so that I can           #
#  integrate them back into my base.                                  #
#                                                                     #
#  I also request that modified versions of this version of QUEUE     #
#  *NOT* be distributed.  Only unmodified copies of this version      #
#  may be distributed (as it comes from me or on the SHARE JES2       #
#  mods tape.)  I would like to avoid the problem with the previous   #
#  version where there are many different versions of it floating     #
#  around.  I would rather have all features in a single version.     #
#  This will better serve all users.  (I will be providing in a       #
#  future version "exit points" where installation local source       #
#  code can be easily inserted without having to have it in the       #
#  standard source modules.)                                          #

#  NOTE:   As of this writing (July 1991, the HELP is close to        #
#          complete, but the CHGS subcommand data is now very         #
#          badly out of date.  I may try to update CHGS soon.         #
#          There is also one major very annoying bug:                 #
#          under some error conditions, you can get a message         #
#          "PRIMARY AND LINE COMMANDS MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE", and        #
#          cannot get out.  It turns out that the only way out of     #
#          this situation is to hit a PF key, like HELP.  I will      #
#          try to have a fix for this A.S.A.P.  Sigh.  It seems that  #
#          this got worse when I added the ISPF support.  You now     #
#          have to attention out.  Maybe Guy Albertelli can fix this. #
#                                                                     #

Installation instructions for QUEUE:

*** NOTE *** This (my) version of QUEUE is drastically reorganized from
             other versions.

In late 1990 and early 1991, I incorporated much of Guy Albertelli's
(B. F. Goodrich) mods to QUEUE.  This project is not finished at this
time.  Also, the ISPF interface still has some problems, but is
basically usable.



 1) Reload the 3 libraries on this tape
    FILE 1 - DSN=QUEUE.ASM       (This file)
    FILE 2 - DSN=MACLIB          (File 179 on the CBT Tape)
    FILE 3 - DSN=TSOCMDS.ASM     (File 180 on the CBT Tape)

 2) It is strongly recommended that you create another library and do
    all customizing described below into that library, so that if you
    get a refresh copy of this library, you won't have to remember to
    copy all your own members back again.  If this is done, you will
    need to update the QUEUEASM proc and place the local dataset in
    front of this dataset.  Specifically suggested:  all JCL members
    that you use, the QUEUEASM and QUEUELNK procs if you use private
    proclib support.

 3) Update all values in MACLIB(@GLOBALS) and MACLIB(@GLOBALC)
    appropriately for your shop.  (Data specific to QUEUE is described
    below.)  These variables are so that programs like QUEUE that have
    installation dependent settings don't need to be modified each
    time a new version is obtained.
    ***  All option variables have been moved from QGLOBALS to    ***
    ***  @GLOBALS and @GLOBALC.                                   ***

 4) Edit the JCL (jobcard, sysout, dsnames, especially MACLIBs)
    in the following members:
    $$ASM     - Use this to assemble and relink one routine without
                needing to assemble the whole thing.  (Not needed if
                you don't modify QUEUE.)
    $$ASMALL  - JCL to assemble and link the main load module (QUEUE).
    $$ASMATH  - JCL to asm/link the ISPF authorization module (QAUTH).
    $$ASMISR  - JCL to asm/link the ISPF front-end module (ISRQ).
                ISRQ is not used if you are running ISPF V3R2 or later.
    $$ASM#CT  - JCL to a/l the text for the 'CHGS' subcmd (QCHGTXT).
    $$ASM#HT  - JCL to a/l the text for the 'HELP' subcmd (QHLPTXT).
    QUEUEASM  - The assembly proc.  If you don't have JES2 V4 or a mod
                for user proclibs installed, copy this and QUEUELNK to
                a system proclib.  If you do not have SYS1.MODGEN,
                change SYS1.MODGEN to SYS1.AMODGEN .
    QUEUELNK  - The linkedit proc.
    *NOTE* -- If you don't have ASMH, you will probably get assembly
                errors in $$ASM#CT and/or $$ASM#HT.  This is because
                ASMFX only allows 2 continuation cards, and these
                source members (Q#CT and Q#HT) are generated by a
                program that reads an image file.  To get them to
                assemble under FX, you will have to fix the handful
                of places where FX says there are too many
                continuations.  This affects so few people that it's
                not worth my time to do something about it.  Get ASMH.

 5a) Set installation options in MACLIB(@GLOBALS)
    &@@QALTC - If you have installed the 'alternate comm char' JESMOD,
               set this to the name of the $SVT field containing the
               alt comm char.
    &@@QCKNC - Set to the number of DECBs to be generated for reading
               HASPCKPT.  This many READs will be issued before CHECK.
               This is irrelevant when using APPLCOPY.
    &@@QDOC  - Set to 'GEN' or 'NOGEN' to control expansion of JES2
               and MVS DSECTS.
    &@@QJOWN - If you have installed a mod that puts the submittor's
               userid into the JQE, set this variable to the name of
               that field.  Otherwise, set to null.  With JES2 3.1.3
               or later, the mod is unnecessary and QSTART will
               automatically set &@@QJOWN to JQEUSRID.
    &@@QNJE  - Set to 1 only if you are running non-SP NJE JES2.
               (HJE1104 or JJE1112).
               *** See Note1 below regarding support. ***
    &@@QPRNT - Set to 'GEN' or 'NOGEN' to control expansion of other
               macros.
    &@@QSFXC - Set to the suffix for your checkpoint dsname,
               normally '.HASPCKPT'
    &@@QSFXS - Set to the suffix for your haspace dsname,
               normally '.HASPACE'
    &@@QSTDF - Set to the name of your installation standard forms
               (&STDFORM in JES2 parms).
    &@@TMPSV - Set to 1 to use the TMPSRV/TMPMAC interface to attach
               TSO commands from within QUEUE.  Also used if not APF
               authorized for CANCEL, DELETE, and REQUEUE subcommands.
    &@@QXKEY - Currently unused.
    &QLEVEL  - Is now automatically set by QSTART:
               (Note:  JES2 4.1 pre AZ27300 is no longer supported)
               EJE1102 =  3 (4.1 + AZ27300)
               EJE1103 =  3 (4.1 + AZ27300 + E3800)
               JJE1112 =  3 (NJE 3.0)          (I think this works...)
               HJE1104 =  3 (NJE 3.1 + E3800)  (I think this works...)
               HJE2226 =  4 (SP1.3.0)
               HJE2329 =  5 (SP1.3.3)
               HJE2330 =  6 (SP1.3.4)
               *** If you are running any of the above releases of
               *** JES2, or 2.1.5, see Note1 below regarding support.
               HJE1367 =  7 (SP1.3.6)
               HJE2215 =  7 (SP2.1.5)
               HJE2221 =  8 (SP2.2.0)
               HJE3311 =  9 (SP3.1.1)
               HJE3313 = 10 (SP3.1.3)
               HJE4410 = 11 (SP4.1.0)
               HJE4420 = 12 (SP4.2.0)

    Note:  Generation of the ACF2 interface is now under control of
               the &@@ACF2 variable in @GLOBALS.)
               Note that this interface is not the one that
               originally appeared in other people's versions of QUEUE.

 5b) Set installation options in MACLIB(@GLOBALC)
     * Be sure not to change the lengths of any constants *
    At .QLCL - Set elements of this array to names that will be
               treated as 'LOCAL' when looking for local output.
               At another shop, this was used because we had local unit
               routes to select printers with different features, but
               want to see all the output when using the "DO" subcmd.
    At .QJES - This is a table to support running the same QUEUE load
               module on different JES2 systems, and also to support
               secondary subsystems.  Each element consists of
                 CL6'SYSRES_volser',CL4'JES_subsys_name'
                 CL6'CHKPT_volser',CL44'CHKPT/HASPACE_prefix'
               At QUEUE initialization, the current IPL volume and
               current JES2 subsystem name are used as lookup keys into
               this table.  When the correct entry is found, the CHKPT
               volser and prefix are extracted.  (The default JES2 name
               is the one you are logged on to.  I use a trick from
               Keith Moe of Amdahl which allows me to LOGON to a
               secondary JES2.)  If you want to select a non-default
               JES2, enter (for example):
                 QUEUE JES(JESA)
    At .QPFK - Default PFK settings.  I strongly discourage changing
               changing these defaults, particularly the ones which
               are set up for compatibility with ISPF:
               help, end, find, and the 4 scroll keys.
               * Do not delete or insert any lines *
    At .QSID - This is an array of pairs of ids.  The first in each
               pair is the SMF id.  The second is what QUEUE will
               display instead.  If you want your actual SMF system ids
               to be displayed (recommended), omit these lines.  This
               is used for lying to the end users -- for example, I had
               a 3081 with SMFid=SCG3, and a 4341 with SMFid=SCG4,
               .QSID  DC  CL4'SCG3',CL4'3081'
                      DC  CL4'SCG4',CL4'4341'
               so that the displays would show 3081 and 4341 instead
               of SCG3 and SCG4.  This feature was needed because of
               the code to pick up the SYSIDs from the QSE'S.

 6) Submit jobs in members $$ASMALL, $$ASM#CT, $$ASM#HT.  If you want
    to install the ISPF interface, also submit $$ASMATH and if your
    ISPF is prior to V3R2, submit $$ASMISR.

 7) Assemble member OACFSRT as load module OACFSORT and link into an
    an appropriate library (RENT).  Sorry, no JCL provided yet.

 8) If you are going to use it, assemble TMPSRV from the other source
    library.  It needs SYS1.MACLIB, SYS1.MODGEN (use SYS1.AMODGEN if
    you haven't installed the SPE that creates SYS1.MODGEN) and my
    MACLIB.  It should be linked RENT/REUS/REFR.  If you have OACTMP
    from UCLA, you can alias TMPSRV to OACTMP.

 9) If you are going to use it, assemble CONS and TERMIO1,2,3,4,5 from
    the other source library.  They need SYS1.MACLIB, SYS1.MODGEN (see
    note in previous step) and my MACLIB.  Both should be linked
    RENT/REUS/REFR.  LKED control for TERMIO is as follows:
       ORDER TERMIO1,TERMIO2,TERMIO3,TERMIO4,TERMIO5
       ENTRY TERMIO1
       NAME  TERMIO(R)
    (If you don't have the appropriate version of PVTMACS, you can
    rename IEETDCM@ and IEERDCM@ to IEETDCM and IEERDCM in my MACLIB.
    These are the non-SP (therefore, non-copyrighted) versions, but
    CONS is not yet dependent on any of the new fields.  You should
    get the current PVTMACS, though.  Future versions of CONS probably
    will be dependent on new fields.

10) Load module placement
    QUEUE   - Can be placed in a LPA for performance reasons.
    QAUTH   - Can go in LPA if desired.
    ISRQ    - Can go in LPA if desired.
    QHLPTXT - Linklist library recommended, due to size and
              infrequent usage.  (Only loaded if needed.)
    QCHGTXT - Same as QHLPTXT.
    TMPSRV  - Same as QUEUE.
    TERMIO  - Same as QUEUE.
    OACFSORT- Same as QUEUE.

    This version of QUEUE does not have a separate QCOMMON loadmod.

11) ISPF support:
    (a)  The QAUTH and ISRQ (ISPF < V3R2) modules must be installed.
    (b)  QAUTH must be added to the list of APF authorized service
         programs.  If you are running a current release of TSO/E,
         this is in the AUTHTSF operand in SYS1.PARMLIB(IKJTSO00).
         If you are running an obsolete release of TSO/E, it will be
         be in CSECT IKJEFTAP (?).  If you're not running TSO/E, give
         up now.
    (c)  Copy members QPENTRY, QPTBL, and QPBRO to an ISPF panels
         library.
    (d)  Copy SPFQUEUE into a clist library.  If you are running TSO/E
         V2 or later, you can use the Rexx version SPFQUEUX instead --
         install it under the name SPFQUEUE.
    (e)  Copy QCEDIMAC into a clist library.
    (f)  Add the following into the &ZSEL TRANS statement in the )PROC
         section of some ISPF menu, like ISR@PRIM:
                Q,'CMD(%SPFQUEUE    ) NEWAPPL(Q) NEWPOOL'  /* USC */
               QX,'CMD(%SPFQUEUE ALT) NEWAPPL(Q) NEWPOOL'  /* USC */
         If you want one or both of these to be visible, you will also
         have to add something in the )BODY section.
    (g)  If you are running an ISPF older than V3R2 (actually I don't
         know about V3R1), copy QCMDS into an ISPF tables library, and
         copy QCQQ into a clist library.  If you are running TSO/E V2
         or later, you can use the Rexx version QCQQX instead --
         install it under the name QCQQ.
         *** If you are running an ISPF older than V2R3, see Note1
         *** below regarding support.


 Note1  It is likely that at some point in the not too distant future
        I will remove all code from QUEUE which supports any of the
        following.  If this will be a problem for you, please let me
        know and I'll reconsider.
        (a)  ISPF releases prior to V2R3.  Everyone should be running
             at least Version 2, and if so, you can upgrade to V2R3.
             V2R3 is the release which introduced the BRIF interface.
        (b)  Non-SP NJE JES2.  (Indicated by setting &@@QNJE to 1.)
             If you were willing to pay for this, you have probably
             converted to SP long ago.
        (c)  JES2 releases unsupported by IBM.  Specifically, QUEUE
             support will be dropped for all releases except 1.3.6,
             2.1.5, 2.2.0, 3.1.1, 3.1.3, 4.1, 4.2 .



 Note2  There are some members in the Q.ASM source dataset which may
        have meaning only to me.  Ignore them.

 Note3  The linkedit of the main QUEUE load module will have some
        unresolved external references.  CHGSTEXT and HELPTEXT are
        weak externals, in case you don't want QHLPTXT and QCHGTXT
        to be separate load modules.  The following unresolved
        references are for features not yet written, and as such do
        not represent errors:
        SETUP, AT#KEYS, CB#KEYS, DQ#KEYS, CKPT$PC
