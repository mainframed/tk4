*     24) AO/DO IMPROVEMENTS                                          *
*         A) FIX BUG SO "AO" NO LONGER DISPLAYS HELD JOBS.            *
*         B) ADD R= OPERAND TO SELECT PRINT DESTINATION               *
*            (DEFAULT IS LOGON DEST)                                  *
*         C) CHANGE PF9 FROM "DO" TO "AO"                             *
*     25) SYSLOG IMPROVEMENTS                                         *
*         A) "SL SYSLOG" OR "SL" GETS THE ACTIVE SYSLOG               *
*         B) "SL SID" WILL FIND THE ACTIVE SYSLOG FOR SYSTEM 'SID'    *
*         C) DEFAULT COL IS 6 (START OF TIMESTAMP)                    *
*     25) NOW CAN FIND JOBS ON MISCELLANEOUS QUEUES SUCH AS           *
*         $INPUT (READING), AND THE PURGE QUEUE                       *
*     26) "DC" SUBCOMMAND FIXED, AND I/O COUNT & ASID ADDED TO DISPLAY*
*     27) HIGH INTENSITY "END OF DATA" INDICATOR                      *
*     28) "ENTER" AT BOTTOM OF DS STAYS AT BOTTOM (USEFUL IN SYSLOG)  *
*     29) "ST *" TO RESET SEARCH KEY TO CURRENT DEFAULT               *
*     30) ST/DJ/XJ JOBNO                                              *
*     31) QUEUE MAY NOW BE "CALL"ED.                                  *
*     32) ALL REMAINING OPTIONS MOVED FROM QCOMMON TO QGLOBALS (COPY  *
*         MEMBER).  ALSO, CONDITIONAL ASSEMBLY SWITCHES PUT HERE TO   *
*         ALLOW ASSEMBLING ANY NUMBER (1 TO ALL) ROUTINES AT ONCE,    *
*         AVOIDING DUPLICATE GBLB DEFINITIONS.                        *
*     33) DCB'S SPLIT OUT OF QCOMMON (INTO QDCB, WHAT ELSE?) TO       *
*         INCREASE SPEED OF SINGLE MODULE ASSEMBLY.                   *
*     34) QDSECT MACRO DYNAMITED INTO ONE MACRO FOR EACH DSECT, SO    *
*         THAT PEOPLE WITHOUT ASMH WON'T GET ALL MACROS EDITED IN     *
*         FROM SYSLIB FOR EACH ASSEMBLY, WHETHER THEY ARE EXPANDED OR *
*         NOT.                                                        *
*     35) DSECT MACROS EXPAND PRE-REQ (HASP) DSECT MACROS.            *
*     36) VALIDITY CHECK CONTROL BLOCK ID'S, TO INSURE WHAT WAS READ  *
*         IS WHAT WAS EXPECTED.                                       *
*     37) CHANGE MEMBER NAMES FROM QNN TO Q#XX, WHERE XX IS A         *
*         MNEMONIC FOR THE ROUTINE NAME.  (ALSO, IT IS THE PREFIX     *
*         FOR LABELS IN THAT ROUTINE.)                                *
*     38) INITIALIZE SYSTEM ID'S FROM QSE'S.                          *
*     39) ADD SUPPORT FOR NON-FULLSCREEN TERMINALS.                   *
*     40) ONLY READ CKPT DATASET WHEN ACTUALLY NEEDED.  (CONCEPT      *
*         STOLEN FROM OTHER VERSIONS OF QUEUE.)                       *
*     41) DELETE "XD" COMMAND, ALLOW PRIVILEGED USERS TO USE "L" ON   *
*         ALL DSID'S.  (Q22 - "XDS" - ROUTINE DELETED)                *
*     42) RENAME "ACTIVE" TO "CPU".  CHANGE SUBCOMMAND NAME FROM "DC" *
*         TO "CPU".                                                   *
*     43) HANDLE DATASET RECORD NUMBER TABLE OVERFLOW.                *
*     44) DON'T LET USER "POSITION" PAST END OF DATASET               *
*     45) "PRINT ON" NOW ONLY ALLOCS AND OPENS PRINT FILE, DOES NOT   *
*         PRINT SCREEN IMAGE                                          *
*     46) ACF2 SUPPORT (I AM NOT THE FIRST ONE TO WRITE ACF2 SUPPORT  *
*         FOR QUEUE, BUT I DIDN'T HAVE A VERSION WHICH HAD IT.)       *
*     47) ADD SUPPORT FOR 3278-3, 3278-4                              *
*     48) ADD DELAY TO KEEP FROM READING CHECKPOINT FILE TOO OFTEN    *
*     49) TOTALLY REWRITTEN "HELP" ROUTINE                            *
*     50) REDESIGNED "HEXBLK" ROUTINE                                 *
*     51) DON'T READ CKPT DATA IF SELECTING SAME JOB AS PREVIOUS      *
*         (THIS IS ANOTHER CONCEPT LIFTED FROM ANOTHER VERSION OF Q)  *
*     52) SOUND AUDIBLE ALARM FOR ERROR MESSAGES                      *
*     53) SYSTEM TABLE SO WE CAN TRY TO GET THE CORRECT CHKPT/PREFIX  *
*     54) SUPPORT SECONDARY SUBSYSTEMS CORRECTLY (DON'T ALWAYS USE    *
*         PRIMARY SSVT)                                               *
*     55) JES(NAME) KEYWORD ON INVOCATION                             *
*     56) ELIMINATION OF INDEPENDENTLY ADDRESSED WORKAREAS SO MOST    *
*         ROUTINES DON'T HAVE TO PICK UP 3 POINTERS, DO 3 USINGS, AND *
*         TIE UP 3 REGISTERS.  (THIS CHANGE SUGGESTED BY MIKE STEIN)  *
*     57) BASIC SUPPORT FOR NJE (SDM)                                 *
*     58) "* F" TO REPROMPT LAST FIND COMMAND                         *
*     59) CAN NOW FIND JOBS ON "PURGE" QUEUE                          *
*     60) FIX BUG IN COUNTING POSITION FOR "STATUS" SUBCOMMAND        *
*     61) "HO" SUBCOMMAND RENAMED TO "DH"                             *
*     62) QUEUE "PROFILE" SUPPORT.  IF DDNAME "QPROF" IS ALLOCATED    *
*         AT INITIALIZATION TIME, SUBCOMMANDS ARE READ FROM THERE.    *
*         IF NOT, DDNAME "SYSPROC" IS CHECKED FOR A MEMBER "QPROF",   *
*         AND SUBCMDS ARE READ FROM THERE.  THESE SUBCOMMANDS ARE     *
*         THEN EXECUTED BEFORE THE FIRST USER SPECIFIED ONE.  THESE   *
*         SUBCMDS SHOULD ONLY BE "IMMEDIATE" TYPE SUBCOMMANDS ("MODE" *
*         AND "QINT").  THE FIRST NON-IMMEDIATE SUBCMD IN A PROFILE   *
*         WILL CAUSE ALL REMAINING PROFILE COMMANDS TO BE IGNORED.    *
*         ALSO, AN ERROR IN ONE WILL CAUSE THE REST TO BE IGNORED.    *
*                                                                     *
