   This exec suppresses the display of the invocation panel (QPENTRY)

   At USC, the systems staff have another panels library, which
   contains a selection to invoke this clist with the ALT keyword.

   This allows the systems programming staff to use special operands,
   while limiting the users to access only the current production
   QUEUE, spool, and checkpoint.
