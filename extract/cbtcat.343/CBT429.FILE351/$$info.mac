Just in case anyone was interested, here are two COBOL/MVS
programs that will display the LE level installed (one for
CICS and one for batch/tso).  They were small, so I decided
to send them embedded in this mail.  I believe they were
based on some IBM samples.

I saw the Cobol programs and have a C program (tested under
UNIX/390) and would add this program to File351.
