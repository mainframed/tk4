Originally, PIE provided an update to the ISREDRTI clist (and, by
extension, also the ISREIRTI clist, which didn't exist at that time)
to create uniquely named edit recovery data sets.  But when the ISPF
exits came along, I coded a data set name change exit that changed
the recovery data set names to include the PIE session identifier.

(I still have a usermod that modifies ISRE*RTI, but all it does is
to add a UID() parameter to the CLIST so that our procedure that
initializes new TSO/ISPF users can invoke it on behalf of a target
new user to precreate their edit recovery table.)

The data set name change exit (Exit 16) contains all the code
required to append the PIE/MultiTSO session ID character to the
end of the ISPF recovery backup data set name.

Note my comments here about how ISPF passes the name:

 Although this is still not clearly documented in the ISPF Planning
 and Customizing manual, the fact is that when this exit is invoked
 for the RECOVERY data set, the only field filled in is the
 OTHER DATA SET field, and the contents are the FULLY QUALIFIED
 backup data set name WITHOUT QUOTES.  There is no member name.
