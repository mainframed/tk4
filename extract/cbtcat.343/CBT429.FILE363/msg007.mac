You are correct. EXIT 16 is an ISP exit and is defined
in ISPXDT with a series of macros (big pain in the you know
what). The Data Set Name Change Exit is an ISR exit and the
name is specified in the ISPF Configuration Table (NMCHGPGM).

It would be nice if the ISP exits were defined in ISRCONFG
as well, but remember that ISPF V4 (and OS/390 ISPF) is really
the combination of ISPF/PDF under the covers.

Maybe Doug and the gang can add that enhancement to our Millenium
X-MAS wish list. :-)
