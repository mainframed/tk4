Last time I fiddled with recovery datasets (a version or two or three
ago), the recovery dataset names were a bit tricky.  What follows is
the situation as I remember it from back then; I have no idea whether
it still works this way.

The recovery dataset names are stored in a table in your profile
dataset (along with some status flags and stuff.)  I think the table
is named xxxxEDRT, where xxxx is the applid, normally ISR.  There is
a clist (ISREDRT?) which initializes this table.  So, to put the
system id in your recovery dataset names would probably require
going through recovery on any existing datasets, then exiting ISPF
and deleting the xxxxEDRT members.  Of course, you'd need to modify
ISREDRT first so the new table gets generated with the desired
dsnames.

When I was doing this, it wasn't for multiple systems, but for PIE/
MultiTSO, where you could run multiple copies of ISPF on a single
TSO logon.  It's been 10+ years, so I don't even remember if I got
it working.  I think I did, with a lot of aggravation.
