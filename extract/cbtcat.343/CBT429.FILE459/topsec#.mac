 TSO command : Display Top Secret short-write-up.

 Restriction : These are "wizard man only" information and actions.

 Installation steps (Job in member TOPSEC$) :
 --------------------------------------------
 1. Pre-requisite : SHADOW/SHADUP.
    The created ->.SHADOW.DATA library is used to copy in :
    a) the member object of program TOPSEC, and
    b) the member TOPSECU (Assembler symbolic).
    Update procedure PAJCTOPS and skeleton PAJSTOPS with the name of
    above data-set.
 2. Needed members in libraries (wizard private) :
    a) ISPF procedures : PAJCTOPS, KSXD (PAJCKSXD), KSXI (PAJCKSXI)
                         and KSXS (PAJCKSXS).
    b) ISPF link : KSXD, KSXI and KSXS.
    c) ISPF panels : PAJTOPSH, PAJTOPSL and PAJTOPSM.
    d) ISPF Messages : PAJT90.
    e) ISPF skeletons : PAJSTOPS.
 3. Create a ->.TOPSEC.DATA library (i.e., 1 cylinder, 20 directories,
    record length 80 and block-size 3120, with RACF universal access
    NONE, thus fully protected against the world unless for the wizard
    man, use also a PERMIT to reject the access by the group-ID).
    This data-set is used to memorize the various users TOPSEC tables.
    Update procedure PAJCTOPS with the name of above data-set.
 4. In the standard ISR@PRIM panel or in the private ISPF primary
    panel modify as indicated below :
         -> in the section : )PROC
         -> somewhere after the line : &ZSEL = TRANS ( ...
         -> insert the line : TOPSUP,'CMD(%PAJCTOPS)'
    This allows the ISPF application connection (only for the wizard).
 5. How wizard prepares users TSO-command :
    a) ask the users to create a common top-secret short-write-up's
       data-set ,i.e., <group-ID>.DOC.DATA, 5 tracks, 2 directories,
       record length 80 and block-size 3120, with RACF universal access
       NONE, thus fully protected against the world, and use PERMIT to
       - reject the access by the group-ID, and
       - allow access to the authorized user-IDs.
    b) enter TOPSUP command to generate the users specific program (at
       edit time of the users table information, supply as indicated
       the above data-set name, the two secret keywords and all the
       authorized user-IDs with their corresponding command name).
    c) after the commands are link-edited, DELETE or CRYPT the users
       table member created in the ->.TOPSEC.DATA library.

 Short example of TOPSEC creation and use :
 ------------------------------------------
 Assumes the following :
 a) the TSO/RACF User-id of Mr. Wizard is SYSWIZ and the RACF group to
    which it belongs is SYS.
 b) the SHADOW/SHADUP application has been installed by him using the
    job SHADOW$, and so, i.e., the data-set SYS.SHADOW.DATA is already
    prepared (RACF UACC(READ) with ID(SYS) having the ACCESS(READ), and
    thus ID(SYSWIZ) being the creator has ACCESS(ALTER) obviously).
    Then, Mr. Wizard has also executed SHADUP to create his private
    SHADOW table of secret keys (link-edited in his SYSWIZ.LINK.DATA
    data-set and used as first concatenation of the ISPLLIB DD card).
 c) the job TOPSEC$ has been executed by Mr. Wizard who has created
    i.e. the data-set SYSWIZ.TOPSEC.DATA (RACF UACC(NONE) with ID(SYS)
    having the ACCESS(NONE), and also in this case, ID(SYSWIZ) has
    the ACCESS(ALTER) of the creator) to keep generated users requests.
 Now, suppose the TSO/RACF USER001, USER007 and USER011 of the RACF
 group ZULU ask Mr. Wizard to give them the TOPSEC facility to store
 sensitive information, which will be accessible only to any one of
 them and crypted with the two secret keys ALPHA and BETA, in the
 data-set named i.e. ZULU.DOC.DATA (RACF UACC(NONE) with ID(ZULU)
 ACCESS(NONE), but ID(USER001), ID(USER007) and ID(USER011) having
 ACCESS(ALTER) to give them the full control over it). Consequently,
 in this data-set ZULU.DOC.DATA, each user may store his sensitive
 information in a member called respectively USER001, USER007 and
 USER011, and crypt his member with the two secret keys ALPHA and BETA
 using SHADOW (pre-requisite SHADUP may be done by each user to define
 ALPHA and BETA keys). Also each user have to decide about the command
 name they want have, i.e., USER001 choices PLUTO, USER007 takes ZORRO
 and USER011 selects CASPER.
 Mr. Wizard at this point may execute TOPSUP supplying :
 a) at initial panel prompting :
    - a member name under which he wants store the users requests, i.e.
      RQZULU (member is builded in the data-set SYSWIZ.TOPSEC.DATA),
    - and the options YES to Create, YES to Edit, YES to Assembly and
      YES to Link-edit,
    - then press END PF-key (or enter END command).
 b) at edit of member RQZULU :
    - the users data-set name inserting card
      col.1 => *      'ZULU.DOC.DATA'
      at the right place, then type KSXI command, place cursor on the
      inserted card and press ENTER,
    - the users keys inserting cards
      col.1 => *      ALPHA
      col.1 => *      BETA
      at the right place, then type KSXS command, place cursor on the
      first inserted card and press ENTER, type KSXS command again,
      place cursor on the second inserted card and press ENTER,

    - the users User-id and command name inserting cards
      col.1 => *      USER001      PLUTO
      col.1 => *      USER007      ZORRO
      col.1 => *      USER011      CASPER
      at the right place, then type KSXD command, place cursor on the
      first inserted card and press ENTER, type KSXD command, place
      cursor on the second inserted card and press ENTER, type KSXD
      command, place cursor on the third inserted card and press ENTER,
    - then press END PF-key (or enter END command).
 At end of submitted job SYSWIZU (all RC=0), Mr. Wizard executes SHADOW
 on the data-set SYSWIZ.TOPSEC.DATA to crypt the member RQZULU with one
 of his private couple of secret keys.
 Now, each user (USER001, USER007 and USER011) can create his member
 (corresponding User-id name) with his sensitive information in the
 data-set ZULU.DOC.DATA and crypt it with SHADOW using the keys ALPHA
 and BETA. Finally, as soon as this is done, when i.e. USER001 enter
 the TSO command PLUTO, he views his Short-Write-Up, if he types the
 TSO command ZORRO, he views the Short-Write-Up of USER007, and if he
 types the TSO command CASPER, he views the Short-Write-Up of USER011.
 The same actions are available to users USER007 and USER011, and the
 rest of the world can't view these Short-Write-Up's, unless obviously
 Mr. Wizard who is the big responsible for installation system security
 access by any people.
