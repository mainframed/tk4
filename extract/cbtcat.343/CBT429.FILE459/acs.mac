*                      STATEMENTS DESCRIPTION :
*                      ========================
*
* PURPOSE : AUTOMATIC COMMAND(S) SELECTION TO BE EXECUTED WHEN THE
* --------- "DYLON" OR "DYLOFF" PROCESS IS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE.
*           BY USE OF STATEMENTS, IT ALLOWS CONDITIONAL SELECTION.
*
* CARD COLUMNS RANGE : COLUMNS 1-72. NEVER A KEYWORD OR AN OPERAND
* -------------------- CAN BE SPLIT BETWEEN TWO SUCCESSIVE CARDS.
*          KEYWORDS AND OPERANDS MUST BE SEPARATED EACH FROM THE
*          OTHERS BY AT LEAST A BLANK CHARACTER. WHEN THE FIRST
*          CHARACTER ENCOUNTERED IN A CARD, UNLESS BLANKS, IS AN
*          ASTERISK (*), THEN THIS CARD IS HANDLED AS A COMMENT CARD.
*
* SYNTAX : ALWAYS, A STATEMENT MUST START WITH A KEYWORD "IF-ON" OR
* -------- "IF-OFF" AND END BY A KEYWORD "C=" (THIS IS MANDATORY).
*          BE CAREFUL IN STATEMENTS SEQUENCE ORDER SO THEY WARRANT A
*          HIGH COMPLEX CONDITION IS MET BEFORE A LESS ONE.
*
* KEYWORD  OPERAND(S)  MEANING
* -------  ----------  --------------------------------------------
* IF-ON    NONE        START A CONDITIONAL SENTENCE FOR "DYLON".
* IF-OFF   NONE        START A CONDITIONAL SENTENCE FOR "DYLOFF".
* T=       S/L/B       TERMINAL TYPE : "S" FOR SCREEN OR "L" FOR LINE
*                      OR "B" FOR TSO BACKGROUND RUN.
* U=       USER-ID     LIST OF USER-ID'S NAMES MATCHING CONDITIONS.
* G=       GROUP       LIST OF GROUP'S NAMES MATCHING CONDITIONS.
* P=       PROCEDURE   LIST OF PROCEDURE'S NAMES MATCHING CONDITIONS.
* S=       TYPE        LIST OF TYPE'S NAMES MATCHING CONDITIONS (VALID
*                      ONLY IN "IF-ON" SENTENCE).
* C=       COMMAND(S)  THE DESIRED COMMAND(S). THE STRING MUST BE
*                      QUOTED IF IT INCLUDES ONE OR MORE BLANKS AND/OR
*                      QUOTES (A QUOTE IN THE STRING MUST BE DOUBLED),
*                      AND MULTIPLE COMMANDS MUST BE SEPARATED EACH
*                      FROM THE OTHER BY THE SEMI-COLON DELIMITER.

*
* HOW TO CODE KEYWORDS AND OPERANDS :
* -----------------------------------
*      1. WHEN CODING U=, G= AND P= OPERAND(S), THE FOLLOWING RULES
*         MUST BE APPLIED :
*           1. A SINGLE NAME MAY BE CODED P= ... AS WELL AS P= ( ... )
*           2. A LIST OF NAMES IS ALWAYS CODED G= ( ... ... ... )
*         YOU MAY ALSO SPECIFY A SHORTER CHARACTERS STRING WHICH WILL
*         BE USED AS MATCH TEST ON THE INITIAL CHARACTERS OF THE
*         CURRENT USER-ID, GROUP OR PROCEDURE NAME. TO DO IT, JUST
*         PREFIX THE CHARACTERS STRING BY A PERIOD.
*           I.E. : U= .SYS WHICH MEANS ALL USER-ID'S NAMES STARTING
*           WITH THE "SYS" CHARACTERS (I.E. : SYSTSO1, SYSTSO2,
*           SYSIBM1 AND SYSIBM2 ARE ALL MATCHING THE ABOVE CONDITION).
*      2. THE SAME RULES APPLY TO S= OPERAND(S) CODING UNLESS YOU MAY
*         NOT DEFINE A MATCH TEST (CHARACTERS STRING PREFIXED BY A
*         PERIOD). THE TYPE'S NAMES ARE THE DATA-SET PRODUCT(S) OR
*         SPECIAL USES, AND ALL THOSE IN THE LIST ARE TESTED TO GET
*         THE CONDITION MET. VALID VALUES :
*                  SPF : PDF-ISPF
*                  IFS : INFO-SYSTEM
*                  SMP : SMP/E
*                  ADA : ADABAS
*                  MFT : MFTS
*                  SYS : SYSTEM PROGRAMMER'S USE
*                  IFM : INFO-SYSTEM MANAGER
*                  DMS : DMS MANAGER
*      3. KEYWORDS AND OPERANDS AS WELL AS MULTIPLE COMMANDS MAY BE
*         CODED IN SEPARATE CARDS, AS I.E. :
*           IF-ON
*                  TERMINAL= S
*                            USERS= ( .SYS
*                                     MASTER )
*                                      SELECT= ( SPF
*                                                ADA )
*                                                COMMANDS= ' TIME ;
*                                                            ISPF '
*
    IF-ON     C= TIME
    IF-OFF    C= TIME
