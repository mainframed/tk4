 ISPF application : Encrypt-Decrypt data-sets facility.
 ------------------
 Restriction : These are "wizard man only" information and actions.

 Installation steps (job in member SHADOW$) :
 --------------------------------------------
 1. Pre-requisites : CRY, EDMODE, EUSID, EUSUB, INTRDR, IOF and R050A90.
 2. Create a ->.SHADOW.DATA library (i.e., 5 tracks, 2 directory,
    record length 80 and block-size 3120, with RACF universal access
    READ only, thus protected against write by the world unless for the
    wizard man, obviously using a PERMIT for him) to copy in :
    a) the members object of program PAJSHDW and routine R050A90, and
    b) the member PAJSHDWU (Assembler symbolic).
    Update procedure PAJCSHDU and skeleton PAJSSHDU with the name of
    above data-set.
 3. Needed members in libraries (RACF universal access READ) :
    a) ISPF procedures : PAJCSHDE, PAJCSHDU, PAJCSHDW, PAJCSHEN and
                         KMX (PAJCKMX).
    b) ISPF link : KMX.
    c) ISPF panels : PAJSHDWH, PAJSHDWI, PAJSHDWQ, PAJSHDWS, PAJSHDWT
                     and PAJSHDWU.
    d) ISPF Messages : PAJU99.
    e) ISPF skeletons : PAJSSHDU.
 4. In the standard ISR@PRIM panel or in the private ISPF primary
    panel modify as indicated below :
         -> in the section : )PROC
         -> somewhere after the line : &ZSEL = TRANS ( ...
         -> insert the two lines : SHADOW,'CMD(%PAJCSHDW)'
                                   SHADUP,'CMD(%PAJCSHDU)'
    This allows the ISPF application connection.
