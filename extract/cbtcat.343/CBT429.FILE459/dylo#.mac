         Before you install definitively DYLON/DYLOFF TSO command, it
    is necessary to tailor "DYLO" modules at your installation needs.
    To do it, I suggest you to follows the listed steps below :

    1. Execute only the steps ASM and ASS of job in member DYLO$ to
       obtain the DYLO assembly listings.

    2. Check the comments at the beginning of DYLO assembly listing
       (normally nothing has to be changed).
       Then reading the comments from the beginning of DYLOCOM assembly
       listing, you must adjust the following parameters values :
       a) the debug user(s), who as first is you, as indicated under
          special operands explanations (macro @WIZ adjustments).
       b) the tables library data-set name (macro @TLDSN). This is
          the general use data-set in the system (to contain members
          "ACS", "ALT", "AOS", "DDT" and "IDV").
       c) the default internal definitions table. Many values are
          probably acceptable, certainly not &DMSVOL and &PV, and
          verify all others, in particular &WU.
       d) the data-sets definitions (macro @DEFI, see also further
          at DYLON/DYLOFF Special Topics). Here you have to define
          the Products you want use and thus for which some allocations
          are to be done. Definitions changes involve other parts of
          the command (as indicated in "Remarks") which are coded in
          the following two members :
          1) DYLOSCO : operands scan. this is the logic to recognize
             and process the operands keywords.
             The SYS (special data-set's status) indicator defines a
             system data-set which is normally not de-allocated at
             DYLOFF time (i.e., at our installation, the data-set
             SYS1.UADS to DD-name SYSUADS, because it is considered
             always needed to users who have OPER and/or ACCOUNT TSO
             command allowed).
          2) DYLOUSD : the User's selection(s) and/or default(s). This
             logic is described in user documentation (member DYLO@),
             unless for the first instruction, which sets the SYS
             indicator and so forces the DYLON command to mark the
             corresponding data-sets allocations as not de-allocatable
             at DYLOFF time (see SYS/NOSYS command operand).
          Note : macros @IF, @CHKO, @SETKW and @SETI have been created
                 to help you in coding your needs.

    3. Also reading the comments in DYLOCOM assembly listing for macros
       to be used, you have to define the following three internal
       tables :
       a) the DDname's libraries concatenations info's table in member
          DYLODDT (use macros @DD, @DS and @DSE). This table is your
          standard and most used table which intents to solve the
          allocations for a great number of users in your system.
          But, if you decide to not use it, you may define an empty
          table by setting an asterisk (*) in the column 1 of the
          statement COPY DYLODDT in the DYLOCOM source symbolic.
          In this case, you must always select a "DDT" member because
          no allocations will take place with a similar table.
       b) the Alias(es) process table in members DYLOUAL and DYLOGAL
          (use macro @AL). This table may be your default table which
          defines the most often aliases for users in your system.
          Also here you may define an empty table by setting asterisks
          (*) in the column 1 of the statements COPY DYLOUAL and COPY
          DYLOGAL in DYLOCOM source symbolic. In this case, who wants
          aliases must select an "ALT" member.
       c) the Automatic Commands selection process table in member
          DYLOCMD (use macro @AC). This table may be your default table
          with the most frequently commands requested by users in your
          system. In the same way, you may define an empty table by
          setting an asterisk (*) in the column 1 of the statement
          COPY DYLOCMD in DYLOCOM source symbolic. In this case, who
          wants commands must select an "ACS" member.

    4. At this point, last work to do, you must update the members
       DYLO@ (users documentation) and DYLOH (TSO help) to reflect
       your installation changes.

    5. Now, you may install definitively DYLON/DYLOFF TSO command
       (execute job in member DYLO$). Remember the following needed
       pre-requisites (SYS1.PARMLIB members) :
        1. IKJTSO00 : DYLON and DYLOFF commands authorization needed.
        2. IEAAPF00 : link DYLON and DYLOFF commands in an APF library.
        3. LNKLST00 : set the link-library in LNKLST lookaside (LLA).
       Then you have just to enter at system console the operator
       command F LLA,REFRESH to have DYLON/DYLOFF ready to run.

    If you modify anything outside what indicated in DYLOCOM above,
    verify the DYLO coding use of DYLOCOM, unless you get a good
    chance that DYLON/DYLOFF command goes in ABEND.
    Note : RACF (User-id/Group) is needed, but if inactive or not in
           your System, then only the TSO User-id is guaranted and
           no Group probably will be handled (I didn't test it).

    If in a "DDT" member you code a DD-name information as i.e.
    below :

      =>DD=MYLIB      ID="MY LIBRARY"                            <=
      =>                   DSORG=PO  RECFM=F  LRECL=80           <=
      =>              DS=<U>.MYLIB.DATA  OPT=M                   <=

    Then :
      1. at DYLON command, this allocation is considered a TSO basic
         use allocation (no TYPE=... declared for any data-set in the
         DD list), and so,
      2. at DYLOFF command, the corresponding de-allocation is skipped,
         which means the DD-MYLIB remains allocated to the session.

    If you want force the de-allocation, you may :
       1. enter commands  DYLOFF
                          FREE F(MYLIB)
              or command  DYLOFF C=' FREE F(MYLIB) '
       2. or use the automatic facilities of DYLOFF command to schedule
          the FREE command, as i.e. in an "AOS" member you may code
                          IF-OFF  C= ' FREE F(MYLIB) '

    Or, another way to force the de-allocation is by defining i.e. a
    TYPE=PRIV at the installation time, as below :

       1. add PRIV in special data-set's status (indicators- byte 2)
          of macro @DEFI, and
       2. add @SETI TDSI,PRIV instruction at the beginning of member
          DYLOUSD (User's selections-defaults).

    Then, it's enough to code :

      =>DD=MYLIB      ID="MY LIBRARY"                            <=
      =>                   DSORG=PO  RECFM=F  LRECL=80           <=
      =>              DS=<U>.MYLIB.DATA  OPT=M  TYPE=PRIV        <=

  *-----------------------------------------------------------------*
  *                × × × R E S T R I C T I O N × × ×                *
  *-----------------------------------------------------------------*

    The DYLON command can't be used to allocate any JOBLIB/STEPLIB
    or JOBCAT/STEPCAT libraries (if you want to do it, the only way
    is through a LOGON procedure).
