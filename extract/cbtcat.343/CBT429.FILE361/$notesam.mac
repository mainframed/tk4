    HERE IS MORE MATERIAL THAT WE TALKED ABOUT. AM ASSEMBLING
  ALL MODS WITH HI-LEVEL ASSEM PGM=ASMA90.WILL RESEND LOADLIB
  REFLECTING THESE ASSEMBLIES. ALL MOD SIZES CHANGED A LITTLE.
  OLD LOAD MODS WERE ASSEMBLED WITH PGM=IFOX00(CXYPSCAN AND
  TAPESCAN) OR PGM=IEV90(ZZRELINK).

       1. FOR PROGRAM=CXYPSCAN COMPLETE DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED
  IN MEMBER CXYPSDOC.

       2. FOR PROGRAM=TAPESCAN I MADE A VERY MODEST CHANGE TO
  VERSION 5.0 WHICH CAME OFF CBT TAPE IN 1991. THIS CHANGE WAS
  MADE AT THE REQUEST OF A PROGRAMMER WHO WANTED A PRINT OF THE
  NUMBER OF BYTES ON EACH FILE AND A RECORD COUNT FOR F OR FB
  FILES. ORIGINAL SOURCE FOR VERSION 5.0 IS IN MEMBER TAPESC50.
  CHANGES ARE IN MEMBER TAPESCAS AND ARE SHOWN AS TEMP LIBRARIAN
  UPDATES TO THE ORIGINAL SOURCE. IF SOMEONE WISHES TO APPLY THESE
  TO A LATER TAPESCAN THIS WILL SHOW WHERE THE CHANGES GO.

       3. FOR PROGRAM=ZZRELINK INFO ON HOW TO USE CAN BE FOUND IN
  COMMENTS AT THE BEGINNING OF MEMBER ZZRELINK.
  SOME CAVEATS FOR ZZRELINK.
                  1. PROGRAM WILL NOT CORRECTLY RELINK A PAGE
                     ALIGNED PROGRAM SO IEBCOPY IS INVOKED TO
                     COPY THE PROGRAM
                  2. WHEN JCL IS CUT INSTEAD OF THE LINKAGE
                     EDITOR BEING INVOKED (I.E. WHEN A SYSPUNCH
                     DD CARD IS PRESENT) THE EXEC PARMS ARE
                     FREQUENTLY WRONG.
                  3. IGNORE ZZRELASM RC=08 IN LINK EDIT STEP.
