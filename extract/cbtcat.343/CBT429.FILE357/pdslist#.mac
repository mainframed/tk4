1                        INTRODUCTION                   Page 3

 This document is intended to provide user information for
 the Partitioned Data Set List utility (PDSLIST). Some
 understanding of Job Control Language (JCL) is required as
 well as knowledge of how programs are executed.

 PDSLIST is mainframe freeware.  You do not need to register
 to use PDSLIST.  It may be placed on any archive, web site
 or bulletin board without restraint.  It may be distributed
 by any means, provided that no charge is made other than for
 reasonable distribution costs.

 PDSLIST is intended for MVS compatible systems to print the
 members of one or more partitioned data sets (PDS's) in
 alphabetical order.  It will process concatenated PDS's up
 to the number currently allowed by the operating system and
 data of any size or type, fixed, variable or unformatted.
 Options may be specified through free form control cards.

 The member data is displayed in the middle 100 characters of
 a 120 byte print line and lengths are printed in the first 5
 bytes of the starting  line for fixed data over 100 bytes
 long and for all variable or unformatted data.  An ASCII
 control character prefixes the 120 characters to minimize
 output.

 PDSLIST through its options will also:
    - Provide an index indicating where each member resides
      and the page number on which the member begins printing
      (INDEX)
    - Provide only the index, not printing any member data
      (INDEX(ONLY))
    - Show only a portion of each member (FIRST(.))
    - Display duplicate members, i.e. show members with the
      same name that are in one or more PDS's in the concatenation
      (DUPS)
    - Show only members that have duplicates within the
      concatenation (DUPS(ONLY)
    - Allow a range of members to be selected  (>MEMBER(.)
      and <MEMBER(.))
    - Display member data as both characters and their hex
      equivalent (HEX)
    - Display a footing on each page (FOOTING(.))
    - Print each member on a new page or separated by a few
      blank lines (EJECT)
    - Indicate whether a member is an alias of another member
      (ALIAS)
    - List the options specified as well as the defaulted
      ones (OPTIONS)
    - Change the block size of the printed file (BLKSIZE(.))
    - Cause characters sent to the print file to be only
      printable ones (TRANSLATE)

1                       VERSION UPDATE                  Page 4

 PDSLIST Version 2 contains a number of changes, mostly
 internal.  It is backward compatible with minor output
 differences.  The updates are:
    - The program is now reentrant and will run above the 16
      meg line (AMODE 31 and RMODE ANY)
    - The code and the documentation have been heavily
      revised for clarity and maintainability.  The ability to
      change option defaults and DD names has been enhanced by
      placing  them all in one area and automating their
      implementation throughout the code (via SETC and SETA
      statements)
    - Display the options used
    - Show whether a member is an alias
    - Allow SYSIN DD card to be omitted
    - Make HEX and TRANSLATE compatible in same run
    - Display footing on every page
    - Use specified page size for all printed output
    - Show only duplicate members in index for DUPS(ONLY)

 These changes reflect all the comments made so far to Steli
 Inc. for PDSLIST.  Thanks go to several people who actually
 read the documentation and suggested clarifications as well
 as to the folks who suggested the changes and to those who
 pointed out the problems.

 Steli Inc. has made its best effort to provide working,
 tested code.  However, nothing is perfect - there may be
 flaws and there certainly could be improvements.  All
 questions, concerns, problems and suggestions are welcome;

1                        EXECUTION JCL                  Page 5

 The job control language (JCL) for PDSLIST is:
           //   EXEC   PGM=PDSLIST ( ,REGION=0M )
           //STEPLIB     DD   DISP=SHR,DSN=...
           //SYSPRINT    DD   SYSOUT=*
           //SYSUT1      DD   DISP=SHR,DSN=PDS1
         ( //            DD   DISP=SHR,DSN=PDS2 )
         (    ...   optionally, as many         )
         (    ...      concatenated PDS's       )
         (    ...         as allowed in MVS/ESA )
         ( //SYSIN       DD   *                 )
         (        control cards . . .           )

 Optional control language elements are shown in brackets.
 The name of the program  may be changed as desired providing
 that the actual program is linked with the appropriate name
 or alias.

 REGION is optional but PDSLIST requires approximately
 192,000 bytes as well as 20 bytes for each member (system
 required resources may increase this amount).  In most cases
 the default region size is adequate to meet these
 requirements.  STEPLIB may be optional if PDSLIST is placed
 in the system's link list but otherwise simply points to
 where PDSLIST is stored.

 The SYSPRINT file may be directed to any output class or may
 be sent to a new or existing file.  The DCB attributes of
 SYSPRINT will be record format FBA and LRECL 121.  The
 BLKSIZE may be set through the BLKSIZE control card option
 within PDSLIST but will default to 121 (since JES re-blocked
 any other size for SYSOUT).

 SYSUT1 points to the one or more concatenated PDS's to be
 processed.  SYSIN contains control information and may be
 omitted, set to //SYSIN DD DUMMY or simply be empty.  Full
 control card descriptions are shown below.

 The DD names and SYSPRINT block size may be changed as
 desired in the defaults section of the source code.  If an
 incorrect name is specified, the program will terminate
 returning the code received from opening the data set (the
 system will generally indicate the missing DD name).

1                        CONTROL CARDS                  Page 6

 The control card values may be specified free form in the
 first 72 columns of the records in the SYSIN file in any
 order and may be separated by commas, blanks or simply
 concatenated together.  Each option must be contained on one
 input line, however, as continuation is not supported. Blank
 lines may be interspersed as desired for readability.

 The specific keywords are sought and anything else is
 ignored.  Keywords must be in upper case but any FOOTING
 data may be any case.  Also, options which require
 parentheses but where no closing parenthesis is supplied
 will be ignored, as will values which require numeric values
 but are not supplied as such.  The last specified value is
 the one used if the same option is repeated.  To change the
 defaults, please see the section below called CHANGING
 DEFAULTS.

 Control card parameters are:

      ALIAS     Show whether the member is an alias in the
                header line and in the index entry.  The
                default is NOALIAS

      BLKSIZE(#)  Specify the block size to be used for
                the SYSPRINT file output.  It must be a
                multiple of 121.  The default is
                BLKSIZE(121).

      DUPS      Indicate that members with duplicate
                names in concatenated PDS's are to be printed
                and shown in the index.  The alternative,
                NODUPS, is the default.  DUPS(ONLY) may be
                specified to have only the members that exist
                as duplicates within the concatenation listed
                and/or shown in the index.

      EJECT     Causes the printing of each member to
                start at the top of a new page. NOEJECT will
                cause two lines to be skipped before printing
                the next member and is the default.

      FIRST(#)  Only the first # of lines of each member
                will be printed.  The default is to print
                every line of a member.  Note this is NOT
                record count, but literally prints the
                indicated number of lines.

      FOOTING(x)  Indicates that the string x should be
                placed two lines from the end of each page.
                The open parenthesis starts the string and
                the close parenthesis terminates the string.
                The default is no footing.

1                  CONTROL CARDS (Continued)            Page 7

      HEX       Causes the member data to be printed as usual
                and then followed by 2 additional lines, the
                first showing the first character of the hex
                representation of the character above and the
                second line showing the next hex character.
                NOHEX is the default.

      INDEX     Specifies an index of member names is to
                be printed at the end of the listing.  This
                list will show all members in the selected
                range including those not printed (e.g. if
                NODUPS is chosen).  NOINDEX is the default.
                INDEX(ONLY) indicates that only the index is
                to be printed and the actual member data is
                not to be.

      LINECNT(#)  Indicates the SYSPRINT page size.
                LINECNT(58) is the default.  This value must
                be numeric and greater then 4.

      OPTIONS   Causes the specified and default options to
                be displayed.  NOOPTIONS is the default.

      TRANSLATE Causes all printed lines to be converted on
                a character by character basis to printable
                characters or blanks.   The default is to
                send the characters as they are to the
                printer, namely NOTRANSLATE.  Please see the
                section below titled PRINTABLE CHARACTER
                TRANSLATION to see the default translation.

      VARSEQ    Specifies that the first 8 characters of
                variable data, if numeric, are to be treated
                as sequence numbers and  printed in columns
                113 through 120 of the print line.  Only the
                data following the eight bytes is then
                printed. The default is VARSEQ.  NOVARSEQ
                would cause all of the record to be printed
                as data.

      >MEMBER(member) Indicates the 1 to 8 byte member name,
                to be used as an lower bound - no member
                alphabetically lower then this member will be
                printed.  The default is to print the first
                member and all following members.

      <MEMBER(member) Indicates the 1 to 8 byte member name,
                to be used as an upper bound - no member
                alphabetically higher then this member will
                be printed.  The default is to print all
                members from the starting member onward.

1                      CHANGING DEFAULTS                Page 8

 To change the default behavior of PDSLIST, simple changes
 may be made to the assembler source code and the program
 will need to be re-assembled and re-linked.

 To change the default, simply find the variable in the
 PDSLIST source as shown below and change it from `N' to `Y'
 or vice versa.  BLKSIZE, FIRST and LINECNT require a numeric
 value.  The same concept applies to the DD names shown.

 The table below is used to translate member data sent to
 SYSPRINT when the TRANSLATE option is selected.  Numbers,
 upper and lower case characters and the primary punctuation
 characters print as expected.  Other characters are changed
 to blanks.

 The table above may  be changed by finding the relative
 position of the character and replacing it with whatever
 character is desired or a blank.

1                         SAMPLE JCL                    Page 10

 An example of JCL that may be used is:
      //LISTPRCS  EXEC  PGM=PDSLIST,REGION=0M
      //SYSIN       DD    *
            DUPS          EJECT          INDEX
            FOOTING(- Top Secret & Confidential & Highly Unlikely -)
      //STEPLIB      DD        DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS4.LINKLIB
      //SYSPRINT   DD     SYSOUT=C
      //SYSUT1       DD        DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS1.PROCLIB
      //             DD        DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS2.PROCLIB
      //             DD        DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS4.USER.PROCLIB

 The above step will print all the members of the 3 PROCLIB's
 including duplicates, a data set list, and an index of all
 the members with the footing shown.  Note the control card
 data is free form and does not need to be aligned in any
 way.

 Another example is:
      //LISTPDSS  EXEC  PGM=PDSLIST
           INDEX(ONLY)    DUPS
      //STEPLIB      DD        DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS4.LINKLIB
      //SYSPRINT    DD         SYSOUT=*
      //SYSUT1       DD        DISP=SHR,DSN=APPLIC.LOADLIB1
      //             DD        DISP=SHR,DSN=APPLIC.LOADLIB2
      //             DD        DISP=SHR,DSN=APPLIC.LOADLIB3
      //             DD        DISP=SHR,DSN=APPLIC.LOADLIB4

 This step will provide an index of the members of the four
 load module libraries input.  In this case it is supposed
 that the data itself is not of interest (load modules don't
 normally list nicely).

1                        SAMPLE OUTPUT                  Page 11

 Given the following 2 partitioned data sets, PDS.A and
 PDS.B, which contain:

      PDS.A
           Member A -- 10 lines of 10 A's
           Member B -- 10 lines of 10 B's
           Member C -- 10 lines of 10 C's
      PDS.B
           Member B --10 lines 0f 10 2's
           Member D --10 lines of 10 D's

 The JCL immediately following will produce the results
 below:
      //PDSLIST    EXEC     PGM=PDSLIST,REGION=0M
      //SYSIN   DD   *
           DUPS           EJECT               INDEX
           FIRST(03)
           FOOTING( - - -  Sample output from PDSLIST  - - - )
      /STEPLIB       DD       DISP=SHR,DSN=USER.LOADLIB
      //SYSPRINT   DD       SYSOUT=*
      //SYSUT1            DD       DISP=SHR,DSN=PDS.A
      //                  DD       DISP=SHR,DSN=PDS.B

 The header lines on each page are underlined - we left
 NOEJECT on to minimize paper usage and the output shown
 reflects the request to only print the first 3 lines of each
 member.

 PDSLIST is generally distributed as a ZIP file, but the
 files distributed easily fit on a 1.4 meg floppy.  The files
 are:

     - LISTASM    the assembler source code wrapped in JCL
                  to assemble and link it
     - LIST       sample execution JCL
     - LISTDOC    this document

 PDSLIST was assembled using IBM's High Level Assembler.
 Assembler H may be used although any blank lines in the
 source will have to be removed.  The JCL supplied in
 LISTASM does not use procedures since many have local
 changes precluding use of specific step names for DD name
 over-rides.  To change from High Level Assembler to
 Assembler H, simply change the program name from ASMA90 to
 IEV90.  The JCL will accommodate either.
