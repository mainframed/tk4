 This document is intended to provide user information for the
 Partitioned Data Set Match utility (PDSMATCH).  Some
 understanding of Job Control Language (JCL) is required as well
 as knowledge of how programs are executed.

 PDSMATCH is mainframe software obtained from the CBTTAPE online
 internet site.  This version of PDSMATCH has been modified from
 the CBTTAPE version to compare member data in addition to
 directory statistics and member names.  This version is being
 sent to the CBTTAPE folks.

 This program compares the directories of two partitioned data
 sets and prints a report showing which members match and which
 members do not match or are not present in both directories.
 Members are said to match if their names are the same.  If
 PARM=USER, members match if they have the same name and all the
 statistics in their directory entries are equal (except fields
 containing TTR track addresses). If PARM=DATA, they must have
 the same name and their data must be the same.

 PDSMATCH through its PARM specified option specifies which
 compare option will be used.  If PARM=EQO, only members that
 match will be listed.  If PARM=NEO, only members that dont match
 will be listed.  If the default is taken, all members will be
 listed for both libraries.

 If PARM=USER, members that are present in both libraries will be
 compared for matching statistics.  Statistics of up to 62 bytes
 of data in the directory entry which is put there by the linkage
 editor, SPF edit, and others.  Note, with PARM=USER, if two
 members have the same name and neither has any userdata, they
 are treated as unequal, with a unique message for this case.

 If PARM=DATA members that are present in both libraries will be
 compared for matching data.  if two members have the same name
 and both are empty, they are treated as unequal, with a unique
 message for this case.

 Steli Inc. has made its best effort to provide working, tested
 code.  However, nothing is perfect - there may be flaws and
 there certainly could be improvements.  All questions, concerns,
 problems and suggestions are welcome; STELI Inc. has a web site,

The job control language (JCL) for PDSMATCH is:
           //   EXEC   PGM=PDSMATCH ( ,REGION=0M )
           //*                PARM=EQO  TO SHOW EQUALS ONLY
           //*                PARM=NEO  TO SHOW UNMATCHED ONLY
           //*                PARM=USER TO SHOW STAT DIFFERENCES
           //*                PARM=DATA TO SHOW DATA DIFFERENCES
           //STEPLIB     DD   DISP=SHR,DSN=...
           //SYSPRINT    DD   SYSOUT=*
           //SYSLIB1     DD   DISP=SHR,DSN=PDS1
           //SYSLIB2     DD   DISP=SHR,DSN=PDS2

 Optional control language elements are shown in brackets.  The
 name of the program  may be changed as desired providing that
 the actual program is linked with the appropriate name or alias.

 REGION is optional but PDSMATCH requires approximately 280,000
 bytes.  In most cases the default region size is adequate to
 meet these requirements.  STEPLIB may be optional if PDSMATCH is
 placed in the system's link list but otherwise simply points to
 where PDSMATCH is stored.

 The SYSPRINT file may be directed to any output class or may be
 sent to a new or existing file.  The DCB attributes of SYSPRINT
 will be record format FBA and LRECL 121.  SYSLIB points to the
 PDS to be processed.

1                         SAMPLE JCL                    Page 5

 An example of JCL that may be used is:
      //COMPARE   EXEC  PGM=PDSMATCH,REGION=0M,PARM=DATA
      //STEPLIB      DD        DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS4.LINKLIB
      //SYSPRINT     DD        SYSOUT=C
      //SYSLIB1      DD        DISP=SHR,DSN=A.PROCLIB
      //SYSLIB2      DD        DISP=SHR,DSN=A.PROCLIB.BACKUP

 The above step will compare the members and the data of members
 with the same name.

 Another example is:
      //COMPARE   EXEC  PGM=PDSMATCH,REGION=0M,PARM=NEO
      //STEPLIB      DD        DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS4.LINKLIB
      //SYSPRINT     DD        SYSOUT=C
      //SYSLIB1      DD        DISP=SHR,DSN=A.PROCLIB
      //SYSLIB2      DD        DISP=SHR,DSN=A.PROCLIB.BACKUP

 This step will provide a list of the members not in both
 libraries.

 The following shows the results of a PDSMATCH run against a REXX
 CLIST library and its backup library with option DATA.

 PDSMATCH files in this library are:
     - MATCHASM   the assembler source code wrapped in JCL
                  to assemble and link it and the PDSCOMP
                  program
     - MATCH      sample execution JCL
     - MATCHDOC   this document

 PDSMATCH was assembled using IBM's High Level Assembler.
 Assembler H may be used although any blank lines in the
 source will have to be removed.  The JCL supplied in
 LISTASM does not use procedures since many have local
 changes precluding use of specific step names for DD name
 over-rides.  To change from High Level Assembler to
 Assembler H, simply change the program name from ASMA90 to
 IEV90.  The JCL will accommodate either.
