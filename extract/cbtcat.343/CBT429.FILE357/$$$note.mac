Sam,

     Here's an update for File 357 from Steli.
  The file is a binary unloaded PDS as you
  asked.  There are 5 utilities each with
  their own documentation member plus a
  @README@ member describing them.

  In brief, the 5 are PDS utilities:

    - PDSMATCH from CBTTAPE now with doc
    - PDSGAS also from CBTTAPE also with new doc
    - PDSPUNCH new to turn any PDS into a
      into sequential file with IEBUPDTE ADD
      header cards
    - PDSLIST list program with fixes
    - PDSGEN can generate delete, de-"gas"
      or simple list of member names

  Please don't hesitate to require any changes
  to the format if need be.  I appreciate your
  time and effort!

  Thanks again...
                            Carl Hafner
