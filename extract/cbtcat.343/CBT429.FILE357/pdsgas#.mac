 This document is intended to provide user information for the
 Partitioned Data Set Deleted Member Restore utility (PDSGAS).
 Some understanding of Job Control Language (JCL) is required as
 well as knowledge of how programs are executed.

 PDSGAS is mainframe software obtained from the CBTTAPE online
 internet site.  This version of PDSGAS has been modified from
 the CBTTAPE version to handle the largest possible block size,
 to create the gas members as regular (not alias) members (to
 allow use of PDS scan tools that won't look at alias types), and
 to specify which gas members to generate (if the directory space
 is tight).  This version is being sent to the CBTTAPE folks.

 This program reads a PDS and finds "gas" members, i.e.  members
 that have been deleted but have not been compressed out yet.
 The program will add a member name to the directory for each
 "gas" member.  The added member names all begin with '$GAS'
 followed by a 4 digit sequence number.

 PDSGAS through its PARM specified option will generate $GAS####
 members for only the gas members specified, e.g.
 PARM=00012-00014 will only generate gas members for the 12th
 through 14th data areas found without a directory entry.  The
 newly created members will start at $GAS0012.

 Steli Inc. has made its best effort to provide working, tested
 code.  However, nothing is perfect - there may be flaws and
 there certainly could be improvements.  All questions, concerns,
 problems and suggestions are welcome; STELI Inc. has a web site,
 WWW.STELI.COM, where the source is available and mail may be
 sent to the webmaster, or mail may be sent to:

 The job control language (JCL) for PDSGAS is:
           //   EXEC   PGM=PDSGAS ( ,REGION=0M ) ( ,PARM=#####-##### )
           //STEPLIB     DD   DISP=SHR,DSN=...
           //SYSPRINT    DD   SYSOUT=*
           //SYSLIB      DD   DISP=SHR,DSN=PDS1

 Optional control language elements are shown in brackets.  The
 name of the program  may be changed as desired providing that
 the actual program is linked with the appropriate name or alias.

 REGION is optional but PDSGAS requires approximately 380,000
 bytes.  In most cases the default region size is adequate to
 meet these requirements.  STEPLIB may be optional if PDSGAS is
 placed in the system's link list but otherwise simply points to
 where PDSGAS is stored.

 The SYSPRINT file may be directed to any output class or may be
 sent to a new or existing file.  The DCB attributes of SYSPRINT
 will be record format FBA and LRECL 121.  SYSLIB points to the
 PDS to be processed.

1                         SAMPLE JCL                    Page 5

 An example of JCL that may be used is:
      //BRINGBAK  EXEC  PGM=PDSGAS,REGION=0M
      //STEPLIB      DD        DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS4.LINKLIB
      //SYSPRINT     DD        SYSOUT=C
      //SYSLIB       DD        DISP=SHR,DSN=SOME.PROCLIB

 The above step will resurrect all the members of the PROCLIB
 specified.

 Another example is:
      //LISTGASS  EXEC  PGM=PDSGAS,PARM=99999-99999
      //STEPLIB      DD        DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS4.LINKLIB
      //SYSPRINT    DD         SYSOUT=*
      //SYSUT1       DD        DISP=SHR,DSN=APPLIC.MACLIB

 This step will provide a list of the first line of each gas
 member and a count of how many there are.  This would be a
 preliminary job to only bringing some back, say due to a small
 amount of directory space being free. Nothing is actually stored
 for this example!

 See the PDSGEN utility for an example allowing easy deletion of
 any leftover $GAS#### members.

 The following shows the results of a PDSGAS run against a REXX
 CLIST library.  Five deleted members were identified and
 restored.

    "GAS" MEMBER AT TTR 00.17.01, DATA:
    /* REXX  - ADD A TAG TO CHANGED LINES: SYNTAX TAG FLAG COLUMN   */
    "GAS" MEMBER AT TTR 00.17.05, DATA:

    "GAS" MEMBER AT TTR 00.18.03, DATA:

 PDSGAS related files in this library are:
     - GASASM     the assembler source code wrapped in JCL
                  to assemble and link it
     - GAS        sample execution JCL
     - GASDOC     this document

 PDSGAS was assembled using IBM's High Level Assembler.
 Assembler H may be used although any blank lines in the
 source will have to be removed.  The JCL supplied in
 LISTASM does not use procedures since many have local
 changes precluding use of specific step names for DD name
 over-rides.  To change from High Level Assembler to
 Assembler H, simply change the program name from ASMA90 to
 IEV90.  The JCL will accommodate either.
