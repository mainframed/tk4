   This is a modified version of the old NETWORK SOLICITOR. I have
deleted a lot of old code, but it still needs more clean-up.
However it seems to run fine. You may need to check the processing
I do to set NIBLMODE. It is based on my local logmode names. You
could probably remove this altogether and use the original logmode
of the terminal (assuming it had one). I put it in for some special
requirements with some of out APPL's.

   I am considering modifying NETSOL to process a USS table so it
will stay in sync with my real terminals. I only use NETSOL for
sessions that don't support USS (TCP/IP, and a DECNET GATEWAY).
I didn't want to use the storage needed to establish sessions
between NETSOL and all my real terminals. This may not be as big
a problem now as it used to be, but USS works well enough so I
haven't reconsidered it.

   If you have any problems, or suggestions please let me know.
