This is a note from Sam Golob.

    If you use WS-FTP LE or some FTP package, to send files to an MVS
system, and the MVS system has its port set to LRECL=80, I think you
can still send the LRECL=88 file via WS-FTP LE, if you pre-allocate
an empty LRECL=88 file on the MVS system, with the proper name.  Just
a hint.  You can check for yourself if it works properly.  In my
limited test, it seems to allow transmission of the complete LRECL=88
file without truncation. But I haven't used the error checking
program against the resulting .XMT file, as of this writing.
