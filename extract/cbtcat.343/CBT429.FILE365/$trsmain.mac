This procedure provides the instructions that IBM customers can obtain
the TRSMAIN utility program from IBM FTP site. TRSMAIN program should be
used to compact the documentation dataset prior to FTP it to IBM support
center. Using the COMPRESSED dataset in FTP will save time in both
sending and receiving transmission.

1) If you have not installed the TRSMAIN program on your local
   system, obtain the load module from IBM FTP site.

    ftp.software.ibm.com, and login with :

   USER: anonymous
   PASSWORD: your complete e-mail address

   Once you login to the ftp site,
   Issue: CD s390/mvs/tools/packlib
   Issue: BIN to set up binary mode transmission
   Issue: LOCSITE RECFM=FB LRECL=80 BLKSIZE=3120
   Issue: GET TRSMAIN your_local_dsn to obtain the load module
   Issue: quit to get back into your TSO session

   Once the TRSMAIN program is FTP'ed, allocate a PDS (i.e. PACKLIB )
   with following characteristics:

    Volume serial . . . .
    Generic unit. . . . .
    Space units . . . . . BLOCK
    Primary quantity. . . 24
    Secondary quantity. . 3
    Directory blocks. . . 1
    Record format . . . . U
    Record length . . . . 0
    Block size  . . . . . 13030
    Expiration date . . .

   Issue TSO RECEIVE INDSN(your_local_dsn) from your TSO session to
   convert the TRSMAIN program back into its load module format.

   The following messages will be displayed after the above command.

   INMR901I Dataset PTFLCG.TERSE409.LOADLIB from NHAN on PLPSC
   INMR902I Members: TRSMAIN
   INMR906A Enter restore parameters or 'DELETE' or 'END' +

   you should reply to INMR906A with the PDS name, which you allocated
   earlier, and member name - TRSMAIN.
   (i.e. DA(PACKLIB(TRSMAIN))

2) Once the PACKLIB is installed, use the following sample JCL
   to create your own job with proper modification to
   &PACKLIB_PDS, &input_dataset and &tersed_output.

   Here is the sample JCL to compress &input_dataset into its
   COMPRESSED format.

//PACKIT  JOB 'ACCOUNTING INFORMATION',NOTIFY=&SYSUID.
//****************************************************
//*                                                  *
//*       TRSMAIN with PACK option                   *
//*                                                  *
//****************************************************
//JOBLIB  DD   DISP=SHR,DSN=&PACKLIB_PDS
//STEP     EXEC PGM=TRSMAIN,PARM=PACK
//SYSPRINT DD   SYSOUT=H
//INFILE   DD   DISP=SHR,DSN=&input_dataset
//OUTFILE  DD   DISP=(NEW,CATLG),UNIT=SYSDAL,
//       DSN=&packed_output,
//       SPACE=(CYL,(ppp,sss),RLSE)

The JOBLIB DD can be eliminated if the &PACKLIB is included in the
LNKLST concatenation.

The &input_dataset in the INFILE DD must be modified with the proper
dataset name that needs to be compacted.

The &packed_output in the OUTFILE DD must be modified with the proper
dataset name. The ppp and sss is the primary and secondary space for
the output dataset

3) Once the JOB in step 2 gets executed successfully, you should use
   the &packed_output in your FTP output process.
   When you FTP this COMPRESSED dataset to IBM Support center, please
   name that dataset with the PACKED as last qualifier, so IBM support
   personal knows to UNPACK this dataset after it is obtained.

4) After the TRSMAIN program is installed and tested, you should share
   this information with your colleagues who work with IBM support
   center, so they can also utilize the TRSMAIN to compress their
   documentation dataset before FTPping it.
