           OSTRIP PROGRAM - TAKES AN .XMT FILE AND MAKES
               NORMAL XMIT-FORMAT FILES, SEPARATED BY
                   ./ ADD NAME=OSTnnnnn CARDS



      If for some reason, OSTARREC doesn't receive a file because
it was corrupted a little bit, but you still want to save part of
it.  Another case:  Somebody sends you an .XMT file, and you don't
have OSTARREC to receive it with.  You still can get the materials.
Just use OSTRIP, which strips all the error-checking information
off from an .XMT file, and separates the embedded XMIT-format files
with ./ ADD NAME=OST00001 , ./ ADD NAME=OST00002 cards, and so forth.
Then you create a pds out of the pieces, and TSO RECEIVE each piece
separately.  Not Ron MacRae's design, but it works, and it pays to
have another tool sometimes.

      Look at members OSTRIP, OSTRIP$, and OSTRIP#.
