This package was submitted to the CBT Tape by Ron MacRae of AMDAHL UK.

This package contains utilities to transmit datasets from one MVS
system to another, with error detection.

Included is JCL to use the compression utility from IBM called
TRSMAIN.  If you want, TRSMAIN can be integrated into the transmission
of datasets, so the datasets will be in compressed format.

Documentation is included in all members that start with $$* .
