  The problem


  At present the ObjectStar Support Centre (OSC) have the need to
  ship PTFs, DBPTFS, documentation, etc. to MVS customers as a
  matter of urgency. MVS customers also need to ship objects to the
  OSC to aid with problem determination. This transmission can be
  via one of the following methods -

  1. ARCSS/NJE link.
  2. ARCSS TSO link using IND$FILE.
  3. FTP via the Amdahl FTP server.
  4. Email attachment via the Internet.
  5. Diskette by post.
  6. On tape.

  The problems with options 2-5 are -

  1. Some packages contain large numbers of files. The packaging
     and transmission of these is complex, time consuming, and
     prone to user error.

  2. PDSs and variable length files are impossible to transmit in
     their original form.

  3. Data transmission is often error prone and sometimes the
     errors are not detectable until they cause problems.

  4. The amount of data being sent is sometimes very large.

  The solution

     The solution is to use two Amdahl supplied REXX programs that
     simplify transmission.

  1. Use OSTARXMT to package datasets, along with error detection
     information, before transmission.

  2. Use OSTARREC to check for errors and reconstruct datasets
     after transmission.

     Both programs will display help Information if the parameter
     '?' is used.

    As well as making transmission simpler, because there is only 1
    file to transmit, we can be surer the data is correct, because
    error detection is done on MVS after transmission is complete.

   Note: From V1.0A OSTARXMT & OSTARREC support compressed data for
          improved transmission.

   Note: From V1.0F OSTARXMT & OSTARREC have much improved performance.

   The procedure for sending fixes, objects, etc. when no ARCSS/NJE
   link is present can now be simplified to -

  1. Use OSTARXMT, on the source MVS system, to package multiple
     files into one sequential XMT file, and optionally 1 compressed
     XM1/XM2 file.

  2. Make the .XMT/.XM1/.XM2 file available to the recipient by one
     of the following methods -

    - FTP the file to ftp.amdahl.com for download via the WWW.
    - Download to a PC and send as an Email attachment.
    - Download to a PC and post (i.e. mail) it on a diskette.
    - Download to a PC and use IND$FILE to copy it via a TSO session.
    - Ask a local Amdahl SE to download and upload between customer
      and Amdahl MVS systems using a PC.

  3. The recipient loads the XMT file, in binary format, to a
     sequential MVS file with LRECL=88 and RECFM=FB or if the
     compression option is implemented he/she can load the
     compressed file, in binary format, to a sequential MVS file
     with LRECL=1024 and RECFM=FB

  4. Use OSTARREC, on the target MVS system, to rebuild the
     original file(s).

    Note: All file transfers MUST be in binary format.

  Transmission of diagnostics and PTFs

  In order to -

  1. Simplify the passing of data between the support centre and
     customer.
  2. Reduce the number of failures in transmission, for various
     reasons.
  3. Speed up the process.

     We have decided to simplify and standardise data transmission.

  Note: We believe that this standardisation will not cause any
     customers any problems and should be a benefit to most. If
     this is not the case we may change the procedures.

  The standards will be -

  1. The use of OSTARXMT & OSTARREC will be mandatory.

  2. We will only send files to customers in standard XMT formats.

  3. We will only accept files from customers in the same standard
     formats.

  4. All files from customers will be placed in their incoming
     directory with names in the format
        innnnn_sss.ttt where -

        - nnnnn is the incident number.
        - sss is a sequence number.
        - ttt indicates the type of file, XMT, XM1 or XM2.

  5. All PTF packages to customers will be placed in their download
     directory with names to be in the format CPnnnn.XMT &
     CPnnnn.XM1, where nnnn is the main PTF number.

  Installation of OSTARXMT & OSTARREC

    If you do not have the two REXX programs, or require newer
    versions, they can be downloaded via the WWW from

    http://ftp.amdahl.com/support/ObjectStar/common.

    This is a secure area. If you don't already know a userid and
    password then contact the ASC.

  1. The OSTARXMT.EXE file on the WWW should be downloaded to a PC
     and executed to generate the OSTARREC.TXT REXX program, the
     OSTARXMT.XMT file, and this document.

  2. If you do not have an existing version of OSTARREC on your
     system then upload the OSTARREC.TXT REXX program in ASCII
     format to a PDS in your SYSPROC or SYSEXEC concatenation.

  3. Allocate a file on MVS with last qualifier of XMT, LRECL=88,
     and RECFM=FB.

  4. Upload the OSTARXMT.XMT file in binary to the dataset from
     step 3.

  5. Type OSTARREC against the uploaded file in ISPF 3.4.

  6. You will then be prompted for dataset names, as documented for
     the TSO receive command, into which the following files should
     be stored.

        - OSTARXMT - the REXX packaging program,
        - OSTARREC - the REXX unpackageing program.
        - OSTAREDC - a optional load module to improve the
                     performance of OSTARXMT/REC.

     You can simply press enter to get temporary work files with
     correct DCB info.

  7. Move OSTAREDC to a load library. This does not need any
     special characteristics.

  8. Move OSTARXMT and OSTARREC to a PDS in the SYSPROC/SYSEXEC
     concatenation.

  9. Edit OSTARXMT and OSTARREC and change the line -

     OSTAREDC = "'CSUPP.SHARED.LOADLIB(OSTAREDC)'"

     To be

     OSTAREDC = "'loadlib.containing.ostaredc(OSTAREDC)'"

  Implementing the compression option

     If you wish to make use of compressed XMT files then you need
     to do as follows -

    - Download the IBM TRSMAIN utility as follows -

  1. Go to
     ftp://service.boulder.ibm.com/s390/mvs/tools/packlib
     with the web browser of your choice.

  2. Select "TRSMAIN" which will download the program to
     your PC.  There's a README.TXT file there also.

  3. Upload this file to MVS in BINARY format to a file with
     LRECL=80 and RECFM=FB.

  4. From ISPF 3.4 against this file type "RECEIVE INDA(/)" which
     will prompt you for a load library into which it will restore
     the TRSMAIN program.

   - Edit the OSTARXMT and OSTARREC REXX programs in turn as
     follows -

  1. Issue the command "FIND TRSMAIN 1"

  2. Change the constant after the "=" sign to contain the full
     dataset name of the program. The string must start double
     quote, single quote and end single quote, double quote as the
     double quotes delimit the string and the single quotes tell
     TSO that the dataset name is fully qualified.

  TRSMAIN = "'CSUPP.SHARED.LOADLIB(TRSMAIN)'"
  becomes
  TRSMAIN = "'your.load.library(TRSMAIN)'"

  OSTARXMT details

  The OSTARXMT program does the following -

    1. Prompts for an output dataset name.

    2. Prompts for input dataset names.

    3. For each input dataset it then

    - Copies the dataset to a sequential work file, with LRECL=80
      and RECFM=FB, using the TSO TRANSMIT command.

    - Appends the work file to the output XMT file, with LRECL=88
      and RECFM=FB, adding an error detection checksum generated by
      XORing the data both vertically and horizontally.

    4. If the compression option has been implimented it compresses
       the XMT file into a XM1 file. The file name will be the same
       as the XMT output file except the last qualifier will be XM1.

    Note: - If a single large sequential dataset is used as input,
        e.g.  an SVC dump, then the normal XMT and XM1 file formats
        will not be used. Instead an XM2 format file will be
        created. The difference between the 2 formats is that for
        XM2 format TSO TRANSMIT and Error Detection Code is
        bypassed and only data compression is performed. XM2 format
        is created in a fraction of the time taken to create an XM1
        format file and is slightly smaller because error detection
        information is not added.  The output dataset can then be
        transmitted, as a single file, to/from the customer by any
        of the available methods.

    Note: - The prompting for dataset names can be bypassed by
        either providing the name of a control file as a parameter
        to the program. The format of this file is -

        - Record 1 contains the words 'OSTARXMT CONTROL'.
        - Record 2 contains the output DSN in any valid TSO format.
        - Subsequent records contain input DSNs, one per record.

        Or providing a single input dataset name. E.g. you can type
        OSTARXMT beside a dataset in ISPF 3.4. The output file will
        have the same dataset name except the last qualifier will
        be changed to XMT.

  OSTARREC details

     The OSTARREC program accepts the input dataset name. E.g. you
     can type OSTARREC against a file in any of the 3 XMT formats
     in ISPF 3.4.

  - If compression is implemented and this is an XM2 file then
    a single output file is created.

  - If compression is implemented and this is a XM1 file then a
    temporary XMT file is created which is then processed as an
    XMT file.

  - If the file is an XMT file then for each dataset in the XMT
    file it -

    1. Checks the error detection token on each record.

    2. Uses the TSO RECEIVE command which -

    1. Prompts the user to override the output dataset name,
       if required.

    2. Reconstructs the output dataset using original DCB
       information.

  Error messages

    The OSTARXMT and OSTARREC programs may produce several error
    messages.

    Other than typing or usage errors the most likely is that the
    ALLOCATE commands used to create work and output files will not
    conform to specific site standards or will not allocate big
    enough files for some large sets of objects. In this case find
    the message listed in this section and modify the appropriate
    ALLOCATE command in the REXX program.

    Please inform the support centre via an MVS incident of any
    such problems.  This will allow us to modify these procedures
    and make them more robust.

  OSTARXMT messages

  - "Workfile 'SYSUT2' allocation failure." The procedure was
     unable to allocate a temporary work file. See other TSO
     messages and modify the allocation for SYSUT2 to conform to
     local standards.

  - "Invalid control file "DSN". Try OSTARXMT with no parms."
     OSTARXMT expects to get either no parms, in which case the
     user is prompted for output and input datasets or the name
     of a control file formatted as described in section 0.

  - "Unable to allocate file" ODSN "with DISP=NEW." Perhaps the
     dataset already exists.  Otherwise see other TSO messages
     and modify the allocation for SYSUT1 to conform to local
     standards.

  - DSN "not found. Rejected."  OSTARXMT couldn't find the
     dataset.  Check the name was typed correctly using normal
     TSO naming standards, i.e. if the name isn't in single
     quotes it will be prefixed with your userid. If the name is
     correct check the dataset isn't migrated. If you had a
     typing error then correct it and retry.

  - "Error writing to ODSN."  Either the output dataset filled
     up, the volume is full or you don't have write access to the
     dataset. If the output dataset has gone to 16 extents then
     increase the size on the allocate for SYSUT1.

  - "All datasets were not processed but" ODSN "is valid." This
     is a warning. The datasets that were specified correctly are
     in the backup.

  - "Unable to copy" INDSN "to workfile." The TSO TRANSMIT
     command failed to write the input file to the work file. If
     this is a large file try increasing the size of the work
     file allocated via SYSUT2. Otherwise check preceding TSO
     errors.

  - "Read error on temp file." This should not occur. If it does
     then record the preceding TSO error messages.

  - "error writing to output file." Either the output file is
     full or you don't have write access to it. If it's full
     increase the size of the dataset allocated as SYSUT1.
