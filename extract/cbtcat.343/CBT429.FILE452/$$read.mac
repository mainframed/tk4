As with the CBT source rules, this code may be freely
distributed.  However I retain ownership of this code.
Thus it may not be used, fully or in part, in a
commercial product or sold in any way.

The files included are all in TSO TRANSMIT format (XMIT).

They must be transferred to your mainframe using BINARY
FB80 format.

After the files have been uploaded, they can be expanded
back into their original PDS format using the following
commands:

     RECEIVE INDATASET(HELP.XMI)
     RECEIVE INDATASET(LOAD.XMI)
     RECEIVE INDATASET(MACLIB.XMI)
     RECEIVE INDATASET(SOURCE.XMI)

The HELP file contains TSO help members for the various
     command processors.
The LOAD file contains executable formats of all of the
     tools.
The MACLIB file contains various macros required for
     assembly of the tools.
The SOURCE file contains the tool source as well as JCL
     to assemble and LINK.

If any updates are made at your installation, I would
like to hear about them.

If any modifications are required, and you do not feel
comfortable updating the source, send an email to me,
and I'll be glad to see what I can do.

Lastly, if you need assistance with any of this code,
feel free to email me.

As this is a pre-release of what will be provided on
the CBT tape/site, I would like to hear of any
installation or documentation problems you encounter.

Installation Instructions:

Most of these tools require no special installation
instructions.  Simply assemble and linkedit them into a
library of your choice.  The LOAD.XMI file is provided
to allow you to try them without even performing this
step.

ADDTO, CATL, LDS, USERINFO and WHOSGOT are all command
processors that must reside in either your STEPLIB,
ISPLLIB or a LINKLISTED library.  STEPLIB must reside
in an authorized LINKLISTED library and the IKJTSOxx
member of SYS1.PARMLIB must be updated to include
STEPLIB in the AUTHCMD section.

PACKMAP, RETCODE and PRU may be run from any library.
PACKMAP will enqueue on the volume's VTOC while it is
being read if it is authorized.  RETCODE will not issue
appropriate error messages for invalid PARM= if it is
not authorized.

TSO HELP members are provided for the various command
processors.  A REXX to invoke PRU has also been provided
by one of the users.  It has been provided with his
permission.  Thank you Oscar.

Sample Batch JCL:

//PACKMAP   JOB   ...jobcard...
//PACKMAP   EXEC  PGM=PACKMAP,REGION=4096K,TIME=1440
//STEPLIB    DD   DSN=userid.MVS.LOAD,DISP=SHR
//DISK       DD   UNIT=SYSALLDA,VOL=SER=volser,DISP=SHR
//SYSPRINT   DD   SYSOUT=*

//PRU       JOB   ...jobcard...
//PRU       EXEC  PGM=PRU,REGION=4096K,TIME=1440
//*     PARM=ALL <--- COPY "LIVE" MEMBERS AS WELL
//STEPLIB    DD   DSN=userid.MVS.LOAD,DISP=SHR
//SYSPRINT   DD   SYSOUT=*
//INPUT      DD   DSN=original.PDS.file,DISP=SHR
//OUTPUT     DD   DSN=new.PDS.file,DISP=(,CATLG),
//                UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(CYL,(30,10,90))

//RETCODE   JOB   ...jobcard...
//JOBLIB     DD   DSN=userid.MVS.LOAD,DISP=SHR
//RC00      EXEC  PGM=RETCODE,PARM='RC(0)'
//RC04      EXEC  PGM=RETCODE,PARM='RC(4)'
//RC08      EXEC  PGM=RETCODE,PARM='RC(8)'
//RC12      EXEC  PGM=RETCODE,PARM='RC(12)'
//USER99    EXEC  PGM=RETCODE,PARM='USER(99)'
