//*     Add to existing allocations (ADDTO)                         *
//*     Updated July 1, 1999                                        *
//*                                                                 *
//*     Many users want their own personal libraries to be          *
//*     allocated in front of the libraries that are allocated      *
//*     within the LOGON procedure. Normally, this means that       *
//*     the user has to re-allocate the DD, specifying all of       *
//*     the libraries with their own as the first library. If       *
//*     the libraries that are in the LOGON procedure get           *
//*     renamed or deleted due to maintenance, the user's           *
//*     allocation fails, leaving them without that specific DD     *
//*     allocated at ALL.  With this command, you simply let        *
//*     the LOGON procedure do it's thing, and in your initial      *
//*     logon CLIST/REXX specify the libraries you want in          *
//*     front. The re-allocation occurs, without the user           *
//*     needing to know all the LOGON procedure's library           *
//*     names.                                                      *
//*                                                                 *
//*     Note: ADDTO can NOT extend DDs that are OPEN. In other      *
//*     words, ISPxLIB's can't be ADDTO'd once you are in ISPF.     *
//*                                                                 *

//*     Fast Catalog List Command (CATL)                            *

//*                                                                 *
//*     The TSO LISTCAT command seems to gather every smidgen       *
//*     of information necessary about a dataset, even if it is     *
//*     not going to display it on your screen. This command        *
//*     only gets the required information, making it quite a       *
//*     bit faster. There are additional keywords to change how     *
//*     CATL displays the output. Try the "SIDEWAYS" keyword on     *
//*     a GDG base.                                                 *

//*     This command lets you list information about your           *
//*     libraries that you really can't get easily any other        *
//*     way.  Actually, until TSO/E, some of this information       *
//*     wasn't available at all.                                    *
//*                                                                 *

//*     DASD Pack Map (PACKMAP)                                     *
//*     Updated July 2, 1999                                        *
//*                                                                 *
//*     Occasionally, you need to know the physical layout of a     *
//*     volume. This utility generates a MAP for you. The           *
//*     output report gives you the relative track, extent          *
//*     length, extent number, CCHH and DCB information for         *
//*     every dataset on the volume. The freespace extents and      *
//*     VTOC information are also displayed in this report.         *
//*                                                                 *

//*     PDS Rescue (PRU)                                            *
//*     Updated November 24, 1999                                   *
//*                                                                 *
//*     Have you ever hit SAVE in ISPF when you meant to enter      *
//*     CANCEL? I have. This utility allows you to get the          *
//*     original member back. The original library is left          *
//*     untouched, and a new library is created with all the        *
//*     OLD members.  Unfortunately, this does not work on PDSE     *
//*     libraries, or after a PDS has been compressed.              *
//*                                                                 *
//*     A REXX exec has been provided by one of the users of        *
//*     this utility. This makes it easier than ever to recover     *
//*     member(s).                                                  *

//*     Need to test the "COND=" or "IF" logic of your batch        *
//*     jobs?  This tool lets you generate a step with any          *
//*     return code or User/System ABEND code.                      *
//*                                                                 *

//*     Dynamic Steplib (STEPLIB)                                   *
//*     Updated September 2, 1999                                   *
//*                                                                 *
//*     With the deficiencies of ISPLLIB, and the other             *
//*     "tasklib" capabilities provided by IBM, sometimes you       *
//*     really need a STEPLIB. I've found it easier to simply       *
//*     forget the other facilities, and use STEPLIB                *
//*     exclusively. This tool allows you to create, alter or       *
//*     remove your STEPLIB at any time during the life of your     *
//*     TSO session.                                                *
//*                                                                 *

//*     User/System Symbols (USERINFO)                              *
//*     Updated April 2, 2000                                       *
//*                                                                 *
//*     Ever need to know your TSO terminal ID, the JES             *
//*     subsystem you're running under or a raft of other system    *
//*     or user related items within a CLIST or REXX? Of course,    *
//*     in a REXX EXEC, you can bounce through control blocks,      *
//*     but wouldn't it be easier to have it available in a         *
//*     defined symbol. Actually, this tool was created way         *
//*     back, before REXX was available, and CLIST was the way      *
//*     to go. With USERINFO, the system and user information is    *
//*     readily available in a &SYSxxxx variable. Simply invoke     *
//*     the USERINFO program at the beginning of the CLIST, and     *
//*     all these symbols magically appear. Recently, a user        *
//*     needed to know what day of the week it was, so &SYSWDAY     *
//*     was added.  The system symbols defined in IEASYMxx as       *
//*     well as the current RACF USER and GROUP names are now       *
//*     available.                                                  *
//*                                                                 *
//*     If you'd like additional variables, and know the            *
//*     control block location, simply Email me and I'll add        *
//*     it.                                                         *
//*                                                                 *

//*     When trying to edit or allocate a library, occasionally     *
//*     you will get a "dataset in use" message.  This tool         *
//*     lets you ask the question... "WHO'S GOT MY FILE"?           *
//*                                                                 *
