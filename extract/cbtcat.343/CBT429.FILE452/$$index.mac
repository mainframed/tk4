                 MVS/JES2 Software

  ----------------------------------------------

I have been developing system software in an MVS/JES2
environment for about 25 years, and have written quite
a few tools to make my life and others at the various
shops easier. The downloads below are currently for TSO
and BATCH. The JES2 utilities are a little harder to
package so they'll be coming later, probably containing
a source stub that will allow for the various versions
of JES2.

Please sign my guestbook, telling me your thoughts on
these tools, and how you hope they will help in your
shop. Also, tell me which item you downloaded. These
entries will help me decide which programs are more
useful. Then I'll be able to concentrate my time on
updates to the more popular tools.

Email me if you require further information about these
tools, or just want to say hello. You can also email me
to report bugs or request enhancements.  I am not
promising anything, but I will get to them as quickly as
possible.

I have other tools that I will be making available as
soon as they are packaged, so if you're looking for
something, just ask and I'll see if I have something
that will help you out.

  ----------------------------------------------------

Special announcement:

The source for these tools is NOT available to the
general public...yet. I am preparing the source and
macros for distribution via the CBT tape or their WEB
site. If anyone would like an early release, send me an
email and I'll send you instructions on how to download
the source. This site will always have the latest
release, even after it is made available through CBT.

Add to existing allocations (ADDTO.ZIP - 4KB) -
Updated July 1, 1999

Many users want their own personal libraries to be
allocated in front of the libraries that are allocated
within the LOGON procedure. Normally, this means that
the user has to re-allocate the DD, specifying all of
the libraries with their own as the first library. If
the libraries that are in the LOGON procedure get
renamed or deleted due to maintenance, the user's
allocation fails, leaving them without that specific DD
allocated at ALL.  With this command, you simply let
the LOGON procedure do it's thing, and in your initial
logon CLIST/REXX specify the libraries you want in
front. The re-allocation occurs, without the user
needing to know all the LOGON procedure's library
names.

Note: ADDTO can NOT extend DDs that are OPEN. In other
words, ISPxLIB's can't be ADDTO'd once you are in ISPF.

  ----------------------------------------------------

Fast Catalog List Command (CATL.ZIP - 5KB) -
Updated July 2, 1999

The TSO LISTCAT command seems to gather every smidgen
of information necessary about a dataset, even if it is
not going to display it on your screen. This command
only gets the required information, making it quite a
bit faster. There are additional keywords to change how
CATL displays the output. Try the "SIDEWAYS" keyword on
a GDG base.

  ----------------------------------------------------

List Dataset Information (LDS.ZIP - 7KB)
This command lets you list information about your
libraries that you really can't get easily any other
way.  Actually, until TSO/E, some of this information
wasn't available at all.

  ----------------------------------------------------

DASD Pack Map (PACKMAP.ZIP - 8KB) -
Updated July 2, 1999

Occasionally, you need to know the physical layout of a
volume. This utility generates a MAP for you. The
output report gives you the relative track, extent
length, extent number, CCHH and DCB information for
every dataset on the volume. The freespace extents and
VTOC information are also displayed in this report.

  ----------------------------------------------------

PDS Rescue (PRU.ZIP - 5KB) -
Updated November 24, 1999

Have you ever hit SAVE in ISPF when you meant to enter
CANCEL? I have. This utility allows you to get the
original member back. The original library is left
untouched, and a new library is created with all the
OLD members.  Unfortunately, this does not work on PDSE
libraries, or after a PDS has been compressed.

A REXX exec has been provided by one of the users of
this utility. This makes it easier than ever to recover
member(s).

  ----------------------------------------------------

Return/Abend Code Generator (RETCODE.ZIP - 3KB) -
Updated July 14, 1999

Need to test the "COND=" or "IF" logic of your batch
jobs?  This tool lets you generate a step with any
return code or User/System ABEND code.

  ----------------------------------------------------

Dynamic Steplib (STEPLIB.ZIP - 5KB) -
Updated September 2, 1999

With the deficiencies of ISPLLIB, and the other
"tasklib" capabilities provided by IBM, sometimes you
really need a STEPLIB. I've found it easier to simply
forget the other facilities, and use STEPLIB
exclusively. This tool allows you to create, alter or
remove your STEPLIB at any time during the life of your
TSO session.

  ----------------------------------------------------

User/System Symbols (USERINFO.ZIP - 6KB) -
Updated April 2, 2000

Ever need to know your TSO terminal ID, the JES
subsystem you're running under or a raft of other system
or user related items within a CLIST or REXX? Of course,
in a REXX EXEC, you can bounce through control blocks,
but wouldn't it be easier to have it available in a
defined symbol. Actually, this tool was created way
back, before REXX was available, and CLIST was the way
to go. With USERINFO, the system and user information is
readily available in a &SYSxxxx variable. Simply invoke
the USERINFO program at the beginning of the CLIST, and
all these symbols magically appear. Recently, a user
needed to know what day of the week it was, so &SYSWDAY
was added.  The system symbols defined in IEASYMxx as
well as the current RACF USER and GROUP names are now
available.

If you'd like additional variables, and know the
control block location, simply Email me and I'll add
it.

Who's Got my Dataset (WHOSGOT.ZIP - 3KB)

When trying to edit or allocate a library, occasionally
you will get a "dataset in use" message.  This tool
lets you ask the question... "WHO'S GOT MY FILE"?
