*         1990 - CHANGED HARD CODED LOAD (SVC 8) TO STANDARD  12/90 JEB
*         MACRO FORM TO SUPPORT LSEARCH=YES SO THAT LPA       12/90 JEB
*         MODULES WILL LOAD WHEN 'LOCAL' IS SPECIFIED.        12/90 JEB
*         THIS CHANGED WORKED ON BOTH SP1.3.5 AND XA2.2.0     12/90 JEB

*         (919) 469-3325                                      12/90 JEB

*   This change was necessary to get the LOCAL option         12/90 JEB
*   working correctly under XA 2.2.  The LOAD did not         12/90 JEB
*   do its work properly when SYSLIB pointed to SYS1.LPALIB.  12/90 JEB
*                                                             12/90 JEB
*   A message of "MODULE NOT FOUND IN MAIN STORAGE" was       12/90 JEB
*   produced, due to the failure of LOAD to put a copy of     12/90 JEB
*   the module into the Job Pack Queue when LOCAL was         12/90 JEB
*   specified.                                                12/90 JEB
*                                                             12/90 JEB
*   The hard-coded SVC 8 was replaced to allow LOAD to load   12/90 JEB
*   the module into the Job Pack Queue.  Without the          12/90 JEB
*   LSEARCH=YES parameter coded, the LOAD macro would return  12/90 JEB
*   the address of the module, but would not move the copy    12/90 JEB
*   into the Job Pack Queue.                                  12/90 JEB
