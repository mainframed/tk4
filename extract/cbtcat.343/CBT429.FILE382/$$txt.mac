Sam,

I have slightly modified my contribution to the CBT, by including
an update to the disassembler from file 171.  It now handles the
01 two byte opcode instructions, and all the B2 two byte opcode
instructions. I have not updated it to cater for the more
esoteric A4, A5, A6, E4 and E5 instructions, but they should now
be quite easy to add.
