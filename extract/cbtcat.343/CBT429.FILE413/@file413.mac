//***FILE 413 is from Ashley Street and contains a collection       *
//*           of TSO and REXX utilities whose flavor is largely     *
//*           borrowed from VM.  So if you're a former VM'er who    *
//*           has to work on TSO, this stuff is for you.  It may    *
//*           even be very useful, if you're not a former VM'er.    *
//*           Very much worth a try....                             *
//*                                                                 *
