FAD-H Software history

FAD-H Software  -  What MVS software should be like

A brief history by Ashley Street - Chief Product Developer/Tea boy

The name FAD-H is actually an acronym for "Flogging A Dead Horse".
Whilst working on a particularly unfulfilling project many years
ago, with my good friend and erstwhile work colleague Peter
Phillips, I exclaimed "doing this is like flogging a dead horse".
The name immediately stuck. Anything written since then, that seemed
useful to us and potentially to other people, was labeled as FAD-H
(pronounced Fad H) software.

Much of the software you will find here is based on VM/CMS utilities.
This is because it was written as part of a VM/CMS to TSO conversion
project we were involved in. Being long time VMers, we were
frustrated by the TSO/ISPF environment and so began trying to make it
more to our liking. Both the PDSFLIST and GLOBALV Rexx functions are
unashamedly rip off's of FLIST (DTRYLST) and GLOBALV respectively.
However, I did write the code from scratch, it is just they have the
'look and feel' of their CMS counterparts. The PDSFLIST program
actually started as a spare time project for me but it ended up
enabling the development staff to migrate their source code and JCL
etc. to TSO and still manage it as a VM/CMS minidisk structure.

With the growth of the Internet I felt that a Web site was a good
vehicle to distribute some of the utilities as freeware.

I have many other utilities and programs/exits that I have written
over the years, so please E-Mail me, mailto:a.street@btinternet.com
a.street@btinternet.com with any requests. Given a bit more time, I
hope to increase the freeware available on this site.

The responsibility of maintaining this Web site, ALL the assembler
code and the Rexx exec's distributed from this site is mine. If you
have any comments to make or bugs to report, please E-Mail me

FAD-H software is only a humorous acronym and IS NOT a proper
software company.
