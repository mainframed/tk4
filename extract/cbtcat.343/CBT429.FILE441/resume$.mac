Someone on the RACF-L discussion list has persuaded me to submit
this program.  Its name is RESUME, and it performs the same function
in a RACF system as the ALTUSER command with the RESUME parameter -
but it runs as a started task.  This would be useful when all of the
SPECIAL users have been revoked.

Full documentation is in the preliminary comments in the source code.
The attached file is a binary download of an XMIT file, as you request.

Brian Vogt.   EDS.   (currently in Deutschland).

PS
I would like to have supplied a postal address and phone number, but
I'll be returning to Australia around April, and they haven't yet
created a vacancy for me.  The e-mail address will remain the same.
