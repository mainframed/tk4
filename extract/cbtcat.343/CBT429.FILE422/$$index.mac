FCBIDR    THIS PROGRAM IS KNOWN AS LISTIDR FROM FILE 316.  I DELETED
          SOME OF THE PUT'S SO ONLY THE USER IDR INFO IS PRINTED
          THIS MAKES A NICE LIST FOR REVIEWING JUST WHAT FCB'S
          ARE ON THE SYSTEM, WHEN, FOR WHAT CUSTOMER, AND WHO ADDED
          IT TO THE SYSTEM

          IT IS USED IN COMBINATION WITH THE FOLLOWING FCB.... PROGRAMS

FCBIDRJC  THE JCL AND SYSIN USED FOR THE ABOVE PROGRAM

FCBGEN    PROGRAM WE HAVE OUR PRINT ROOM OPERATORS USE TO CREATE FCB'S
          A CLIST IS USED TO INVOKE AND IS FCBGENC.  THE ROUTINE ASKS
          FOR LAST 4 POSITIONS OF FCB NAME, CHANNEL/LINES, REQUESTOR,
          AND CUSTOMER OR FORM NAME.  IT THEN CHECKS TO MAKE SURE THAT
          THIS FCB DOES NOT ALREADY EXIST.  IF IT DOES IT ASKS THE
          OPERATOR IF IT IS OK TO REPLACE. IF YES, ROUTINE CONTINUES.
          IF NOT ROUTINE ASKS FOR A NEW NAME.  REQUESTOR AND
          CUSTOMER/FORM AND DATE CREATED IS ENTERED AS IDR DATA
          FOR AUDIT USES LATER.  THE PROGRAM THEN EXECUTES FCBWTO
          AT COMPLETION TO NOTIFY THE USER WHEN THE FCB IS AVAILABLE.
