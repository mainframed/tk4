Sam,

[I'm copying this to IBM-MAIN as well as I have received a number of
similar requests from readers there]

Starting TCAS under MSTR is easy.  It requires no modifications.  We
use JCL like this:

 //TCAS    PROC MBR=TSOKEY00
 //STEP1   EXEC PGM=IKTCAS00,TIME=NOLIMIT
 //PARMLIB  DD  DSN=SYS2.PARMLIB(&MBR),DISP=SHR,FREE=CLOSE
 //PRINTOUT DD  DSN=SYS1.TCASOUT,DISP=SHR,FREE=CLOSE

That way TCAS is available after VTAM comes up and doesn't require JES.
Now, the tricky part is modifying TSO to allow you to logon to
different subsystems (e.g., JES3/JES2 primary, JES2 secondary, or
MSTR).  The code to make this work is available from my ftp site at:

  ftp://phoenixsoftware.com/pub/demo/tsomods.zip

It is running on my OS/390 V2R7.0 system without problems and has not
been changed for many, many years so it should work for everyone.

When logged on under MSTR, you can't do anything that relies upon the
JES-provided life-of-job SSIB.  That means job submit will not work
as MSTR provides no internal reader support.  However, that doesn't
mean you are running "blind" and can't see JES resources (if it's
up).  JES2/SDSF users can specify JESNAME(JES2) in ISFPRMxx or
JESNAME=JES2 on ISFPMAC to force SDSF to find the JES2 subsystem
directly, without going through life-of-job SSIB.  Likewise,
JES3/(E)JES users can specify JESNAME=JES3 on EJESOPT to force (E)JES
to find the JES3 subsystem directly without going through life-of-job
SSIB.  I imagine there are similar means by which other, less
well-established, systems management utilities can be told not to use
life-of-job SSIB.
