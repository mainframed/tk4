//***FILE 377 is from Ed Jaffe of Los Angeles, California, and      *
//*           contains some modifications to TSO, so you can start  *
//*           TCAS under SUB=MSTR.  In other words, you can run     *
//*           TSO without JES.  This is an excellent recovery       *
//*           tool, if you have it set up at your shop.             *
//*                                                                 *
//*           This code is running on OS/390 Release 2.7, and       *
//*           has been stable for many years.                       *

//*           There is also a REXX exec called TL on this file,     *
//*           which builds JCL to label a tape, and submits it      *
//*           to the internal reader.                               *
