  Calling sequence : CALL GUAR,(A,B,C),VL
  ------------------ CALL GUAR,(A,B),VL

         Where : A - is the address of the desired USERID (format CL7).
                     This argument is mandatory, and must be right
                     padded with blanks.

                 B - is the address of an array into which the account
                     filed(s) for the requested USERID are stored. The
                     format is as follows :
                             DC  AL2(no. of account fields or zero)
                             DC  AL1(L'ACC1)
                       ACC1  DC  C'account field'
                             ...
                             DC  AL1(L'ACCN)
                       ACCN  DC  C'account field'
                     The array must be large enough to receives the
                     maximum number of account fields for a USERID,
                     unless unpredictable results may occur.
                     This argument is mandatory.

                 C - is the address of the indicator response (format
                     FULLWORD - F boundary) if supplied (optional).
                     Value is always placed in register 15 and can be :

                     -1 - USERID not found.
                      0 - request correctly exhausted.
                      1 - SYSUADS DD-card missing.
                      2 - SYSUADS OPEN error.
                      3 - SYSUADS BLDL error.
                      4 - SYSUADS unexpected EOF.
                      5 - SYSUADS READ error.
                      6 - calling sequence or argument error.

         Register use may be coded within parentheses.

  Calling sequence : CALL GUACL,(A),VL
  ------------------ CALL GUACL ---> with R1=0

         Where : A - is the address of the indicator response (format
                     FULLWORD - F boundary) if supplied (optional).
                     Value is always placed in register 15 and can be :

                      0 - CLOSE correctly executed.
                      1 - calling sequence or argument error.

  Assembler macro : $GUACL A
  -----------------

         Where A is optional and may be omitted.
         Register use may be coded within parentheses.


  NOTES : 1. On any error detection, a message is included in the
  =======    message class for the job.
          2. When running, this routine needs a JCL DD-card as below :
               //SYSUADS DD DSN=SYS1.UADS,DISP=SHR
          3. At the first call of GUAR, the UADS data-set is opened,
             then, as for successive calls, the records pertaining
             to the desired USERID are read. At execution end, call
             GUACL to close the UADS data-set.
             It is suggested to fill dynamically an internal table
             with the received information in order to minimize the
             number of I/O operations.
