  Calling sequence : CALL GACTN,(A,B),VL
  ------------------            (A)

         Where : A - is the address of a field (format CL8) into
                     which the accounting number information for
                     the current job is placed. This argument is
                     mandatory because information is returned to
                     the caller.

                 B - is the address of the indicator response (format
                     FULLWORD - F boundary) if supplied (optional).
                     Value is always placed in register 15 and can be :

                      0 - Accounting number is returned back.
                      1 - Calling sequence or argument alignment error.
                      2 - Job Control Table (SWA/JCT) not found.

  Calling sequence : CALL GNAME,(A,B),VL
  ------------------            (A)

         Where : A - is the address of a field (format CL20) into
                     which the programmer's name of the current job
                     is placed. This argument is mandatory because
                     information is returned to the caller.

                 B - is the address of the indicator response (format
                     FULLWORD - F boundary) if supplied (optional).
                     Value is always placed in register 15 and can be :

                      0 - Programmer's name is returned back.
                      1 - Calling sequence or argument alignment error.
                      2 - Job Control Table (SWA/JCT) not found.
                      3 - Accounting Control Table (SWA/ACT) not found.
