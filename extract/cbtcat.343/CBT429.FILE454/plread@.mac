  Calling sequence : CALL PLREAD,(A,B,C),VL
  ------------------             (A,B)
                                 (A)

         Where : A - is the address of 2 words (format FULLWORD - F
                     boundary) into which the address and the length
                     of the next sequential physical record of a
                     partitioned data-set load-module (pointed to by
                     PLPOINT) are passed (stored). This argument is
                     mandatory because information is returned to
                     the caller.

                 B - is the address of the DD-name (format CL8) if
                     supplied (optional). When this argument is
                     omitted, or the address of this argument is set
                     to zero in the parameters list, the default
                     DD-name used is SYSLOAD.

                 C - is the address of the indicator response (format
                     FULLWORD - F boundary) if supplied (optional).
                     Value is always placed in register 15 and can be :

                     -1 - Load-module reaches END-OF-FILE.
                      0 - READ correctly executed.
                      1 - file not opened.
                      2 - calling sequence or argument alignment error.
                      3 - READ error.

                 B - is the address of the DD-name (format CL8) if

                     FULLWORD - F boundary) if supplied (optional).
                     Value is always placed in register 15 and can be :

                      0 - Load-module POINTed.
                      1 - file not opened.
                      2 - calling sequence or argument alignment error.

  Calling sequence : CALL PLOPEN,(A,B),VL
  ------------------             (A)

         Where : A - is the address of the DD-name (format CL8) if
                     supplied (optional). When this argument is
                     omitted, or the address of this argument is set
                     to zero in the parameters list, or the parameters
                     list pointer (register 1) is zero, the default
                     DD-name used is SYSLOAD.

                 B - is the address of the indicator response (format
                     FULLWORD - F boundary) if supplied (optional).
                     Value is always placed in register 15 and can be :

         Where : A - is the address of the DD-name (format CL8) to
                     close. If this argument contains the CLOSEALL
                     keyword, or the address of this argument is set
                     to zero in the parameters list, or the parameters
                     list pointer (register 1) is zero, all the opened
                     files are closed.

                 B - is the address of the indicator response (format
                     FULLWORD - F boundary) if supplied (optional).

  General notice : On any error detection, a message is included in
  ================ the message class for the job.
                   If the routine is re-called after IND = 1 or 2,
                   the program is sended in abend U0001.
                   If the indicator response is detected 10 times
                   different from 0, the program is sended in
                   abend U0002.
                   This routine is multi-files usable, that means
                   multi-files opened concurrently (using the DD-name
                   argument).
