  Purpose :    Allows a program running in a TSO environment to
  ---------    invoke and thus execute TSO commands and/or CLISTs
               (implicit form only is accepted).

  Calling sequence : CALL XTC,(A,B,C,D),VL
  ------------------          (A,B,C)
                              (A,B)
                              (A)

         Where : A - is the address of the TSO command or CLIST text
                     to be invoked (no alignment needed, but maximum
                     240 characters long allowed).
                 B - is the address of the TSO command or CLIST text
                     length (number of characters - FULLWORD). When
                     this argument is omitted, or the address of this
                     argument is set to zero in the parameters list,
                     the length is assumed to be in the byte (format
                     XL1) just preceeding the TSO command or CLIST
                     text, at the address of A-1.
                 C - is the address of a FULLWORD into which the TSO
                     command or CLIST execution highest completion
                     code is stored (format XL4'00SSSUUU', where SSS
                     is the system code and UUU is the user code),
                     if supplied.
                     In any case the value is always placed in the
                     register 0.
                 D - is the address of a FULLWORD to store the return
                     code, if supplied. Value is always placed in
                     register 15 and can be :
                      0 - all processings done.
                      1 - command failed.
                      2 - invalid command text length.
                      3 - argument alignment error.
                      4 - missing command.
                      5 - invalid command.
                      6 - command rejected (unsupported).
                      7 - unable to locate CPPL.
                      8 - not TSO environment.

         At entry, register 0 is used as messages switch :
                 - zero to suppress all messages.
                 - positive to obtain error messages only.
                 - negative to obtain all messages.

                                                      XTC       2/2.

  Assembler macro : $XTC A,B,C,D,TSO=,MSG=YES,MF=E
  -----------------                       NO     (E,...)
                                          ALL
                 or $XTC A,B,C,D,MF=L

         Where B, C and/or D are optional and may be omitted.
         Register use may be coded within parentheses (obviously
         only in the execute form of the macro).
         Default : MSG=YES and MF=E.

  BACKGROUND execution :
  ----------------------

         When used by a program in batch, it must be started by the
  following JCL statements :

         //IKJ     EXEC PGM=IKJEFT01
         //SYSPROC   DD ... TSO commands procedures ...
         //...       DD ... Program DD's if needed ...
         //SYSTSPRT  DD SYSOUT=*
         //SYSTSIN   DD *
         CALL ...Program...
         END
         /*

  ADVICE : When running in a batch environment, the commands or
  ======== programs using TPUT/TGET are not supported.
