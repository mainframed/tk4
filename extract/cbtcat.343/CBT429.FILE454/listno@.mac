  Parm. field description :
  -------------------------

         MANUAL=... - The name (1 to 6 alphamerics) of the manual
         M=...        main member, containing the title and the
                      list of all the members component of this
                      manual. The name given by this parameter is
                      surrounded by the character # to form the
                      manual main member name. If omitted, the
                      default name used is #MANUAL#.

         DATE=...   - The date of the last time the manual or the
         D=...        updated pages have been requested. The format
                      is DDMMYY, DD.MM.YY or DD/MM/YY, where DD is
                      the day, MM is the month and YY is the year.

         LIST=...   - The name (1 to 8 alphamerics) of a specific
         L=...        member (no default supplied). This way of use
                      exclude any other selection type (MANUAL=...,
                      DATE=... or requests cards).

  Requests cards (SYSIN) :
  ------------------------

         The requests cards are free format coded from column 1 to
         72 included, and every request must be separated from each
         other by at least one blank. A request is a manual name
         (1 to 6 alphamerics), eventually followed by a date (format
         may be DDMMYY, DD.MM.YY or DD/MM/YY) to obtain the updated
         pages of the manual.
         Never a manual name or a data must be splitted between two
         successive cards, but i.e., a manual name may be in a card
         and the corresponding selection date in the next.
