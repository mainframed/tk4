  Calling sequence : CALL SSCMD,(A,B,C),VL
  ------------------            (A,B)
                                (A)

         Where : A - is the address of the area containing the system
                     command text.

                 B - is the address of the system command text area
                     length (no. of characters : format FULLWORD _ F
                     boundary). When this argument is omitted, or the
                     address of this argument is set to zero in the
                     parameters list, the length of the text area is
                     supposed to be in front of the text area, at the
                     address of A-1 (format XL1).

                 C - is the indicator response (format FULLWORD - F
                     boundary) if supplied (optional). Value is always
                     placed in register 15 and can be :

                          0 = command sended.
                     LT 256 = SVC 34 return code.
                        256 = command text length is zero.
                        260 = command text is all blanks.
                        264 = command text length greater than 126.
                        268 = calling sequence or parameter alignment
                              error.
                        272 = unauthorized caller.

  Assembler macro : $SSCMD A,B,C
  -----------------

         Where B and/or C are optional and may be omitted.
         Register use may be coded within parentheses.

  General notice : This subroutine is reentrant.
  ---------------- Only a system or started task may use this routine.
                   The system command text is extracted from the area
                   eliminating all eventual starting and/or trailing
                   blanks, then it cannot be more than 126 characters
                   long. All commands sended to the system are logged
                   on SYSLOG with the sender job-name.
