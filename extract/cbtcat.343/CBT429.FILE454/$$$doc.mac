     Many products in these files have been extracted from the CBT
     tapes (JUN 84, FEB 85, FEB 86, FEB 87, FEB 88, FEB 89, MAY 90,
     MAR 91, MAR92, ...), adapted and/or enhanced to our installation
     needs or facilities. The material provided in these files run on
     system MVS 3.8 SP 2.2.3 (MVS/XA).

 Products installation requirement :
 -----------------------------------
     See to the member $$$PROCS which contains a job to store the
     procedures used for products installation.
     Notes : 1. I normally use the assembler H, so I can't guarantee
                against possible errors with the assembler F.
             2. AMODE and RMODE 24 is indicated for modules having
                control blocks containing 24-bit addresses (i.e. DCB).

 Data-set members structure :
 ----------------------------
     The members names ending by a dollar sign ($) are the JCL to
     install (assembly + link-edit) the modules, and the members
     names ending by a paragraph sign (@) are the corresponding
     assembler macros or modules documentation.

 ATTENTION : we have installed the C.J.S. (Chained Jobs Scheduling,
 ----------- product 5785-GAK) which requires the change of the JES2
     standard dollar sign ($) for local operator and instream command
     identifier (JES2PARM allows it). We have choiced the period (.),
     so be carefull and checks modules involving operators commands to
     your needs (i.e., DIDOCS and SCHEDRUN).

 IOF product : some procedures (i.e. PAJCSHWM) use IOFSPF which is
 ------------- the Interactive Output Facility from Triangle Systems,
               Inc. P.O. box 12752, Research Triangle Park, NC 27709.

 ADVICE - US and European characters differences :
 -------------------------------------------------
          Sorry, but working on European terminals, some differences
     may occur in special characters use. A well known one to us is the
     exclamation mark which is X'5A' hexadecimal value in US, but this
     value corresponds to a small letter e with acute accent at our
     installation. Consequently, in a lot of members in these files,
     we have replaced it by the X'4F' hexadecimal value which is the
     one representing the exclamation mark on our terminals.
          Unfortunately, you can't apply automatically a change from
     X'4F' to X'5A' or vive versa, because i.e., an ISPF Edit macro
     is recognized only if invoked with an X'5A' character.
          In some products, I have supplied the selection through the
     Assembler SYSPARM option.

                   *********************************
                   ***     INFORMATION NOTES     ***
                   *********************************

     If you install the LISTNO program, you may then SUBMIT the job
 below to obtain a copy of this document :
         //...      JOB ...
         //DOC     EXEC PGM=LISTNO,PARM='M=DOC'
         //SYSPDS    DD DSN=->.SOURCE.FILE0,DISP=SHR
         //SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=A
     A complete information notes list (about 8000 lines) may be also
 obtained by this job if you specify M=INFO as parameter.
     If you omit the PARM field or specify M=MANUAL, you will receive
 an example of how to build a manual of notes.

                     ******************************

     All members names starting by PAJ... are ISPF members which allow
 you an easy way to execute many of distributed commands and functions
 (actual ISPF version at J.R.C. is 2.3.0), as i.e. :
         PAJPALL  : display data-sets allocated to TSO user.
         PAJPBLK  : disk block-sizes computations.
         PAJPBUMU : broadcast user messages unload.
         PAJPPOF  : VTAM secondary program operator facility.
         PAJPVQ   : GRS/ENQ display.
     The members named CBOOK000, MBKS00, SBOOK0 and all PBOOK... are
 part of an ISPF application example giving you a facility to maintain
 a set of IBM manuals lists.
     To install it, here follows the list of members which must be
 placed in the following ISPF target libraries :
         1. In the ISPF Link library :
                   Execute members PAJ$BLK1, PAJ$BLK2, PAJ$BUMU,
                   ISPCDSN$ and CRY$.
         2. In the ISPF Panels library :
                   Execute member PAJ$$ICP.
         3. In the ISPF CLISTs library :
                   Execute member PAJ$$ICC.
         4. In the ISPF Messages library :
                   Execute member PAJ$$ICM.
         5. In the ISPF Tables library :
                   Execute member PAJ$$ICT.
                   (members names are TMTH... and TWKD...)
         6. In the ISPF Skeletons library :
                   Execute member PAJ$$ICS.
     Then modify the ISPF primary panel (ISR@PRIM) with a selection
 call to the PAJMENU panel for these "PRIVATE" functions. Distributed
 example panels NEW@PRIM-NEW@MENU shows how to do it with colours too.
     Obviously, you may tailor and reorganize all these ISPF members
 as well as you need, they may give you ideas for further developments.
