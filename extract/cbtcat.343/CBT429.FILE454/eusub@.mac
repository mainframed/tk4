  Purpose :    Allows the SUBMIT of a batch job for conventional
  ---------    processing. The job submitted may reside in a sequential
               data-set or in a member of a partitioned data-set (fixed
               80-bytes records, blocked or unblocked), but the DD-name
               to access it must be SYSPO.

               Note - JCL JOB statement coding : must be the first and
                      may contain all the needed information. The
                      submit function will supply the password only
                      when the USER=... keyword is coded and the
                      PASSWORD=... keyword is not coded (this assumes
                      the JOB statement is more than one card coded).

  Invoked by : Console START command :
  ------------      S R1,FROM='...PO-dsname...',
                           M=...member-name...

               Where R1 is the following procedure :
                    //R1       PROC FROM='->.OPER.PDS.CNTL',M=
                    //R1       EXEC PGM=EUSUB
                    //SYSPO    DSN=&FROM(&M),DISP=SHR
                    //SYSSU    DD SYSOUT=(,INTRDR)
