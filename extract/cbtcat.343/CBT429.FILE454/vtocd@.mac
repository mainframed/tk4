  Purpose :    Routine to read and/or write in direct mode a VTOC.
  ---------    A DD-card, written as below, is needed to define
               the desired volume :

               //...     DD  UNIT=...,VOLUME=SER=...,DISP=OLD


  Calling sequence : CALL VTOCDR,(A,B,C),VL
  ------------------             (A,B)
                                 (A)

         Where : A - is the address of an array (format FULLWORD -
                     F boundary) to read a DSCB's record (140 bytes
                     long).

                 B - is the address of the DSCB's record address read,
                     in the format MBBCCHHR (format XL8).

                 C - is the address of the indocator response (format
                     FULLWORD - F boundary) if supplied (optional).
                     Value is always placed in register 15 and can be :

                      0 - READ operation correctly executed.
                      1 - READ error.
                      2 - file not opened.
                      3 - calling sequence or argument alignment error.

  Assembler macro : $VTOCDR A,B,C
  -----------------

         Where C is optional and may be omitted.
         Register use may be coded within parentheses.

  Calling sequence : CALL VTOCDW,(A,B,C),VL
  ------------------             (A,B)
                                 (A)

         Where : A - is the address of an array (format FULLWORD -
                     F boundary) containing a DSCB's record (140 bytes
                     long) to write.

                 B - is the address of the DSCB's record address to
                     write, in the format MBBCCHHR (format XL8).

                 C - is the address of the indicator response (format
                     FULLWORD - F boundary) if supplied (optional).
                     Value is always placed in register 15 and can be :

                      0 - WRITE operation correctly executed.
                      1 - WRITE error.
                      2 - file not opened.
                      3 - calling sequence or argument alignment error.

  ------------------             (A,B)
                                 (A)

         Where : A - is the address of the DD-name (format CL8).

                 B - is the address of the device characteristics
                     (format FULLWORD - F boundary) returned by the
                     routine if supplied (optional). It will receive
                     five fullwords information as described in DEVTYPE
                     macro (see OS/VS2 System Programming Library :
                     Data Management), followed by one halfword
                     containing the number of alternate tracks for
                     the device, followed by a six characters field
                     containing the volume serial number of the
                     device. This argument is optional and may be
                     omitted or his address may be set to zero in the
                     parameters list.

                      3 - calling sequence or argument alignment error.
                      4 - not OS/VS2 System.
                      5 - DD-card missing.
                      6 - not direct-access storage device.
                      7 - read JFCB error.
                      8 - DD-card incorrectly coded.

                     FULLWORD - F boundary) if supplied (optional :
                     argument may be omitted passing a zero parameters
                     list pointer - register 1). Value is always placed
                     in register 15 and can be :

                      0 - CLOSE correctly executed.
                      1 - calling sequence or argument alignment error.

  General notice : on error reading or writing a VTOC's DSCB a message
  ================ is included in the message class for the job.
                   This routine is only serially volumes usable.
