%Object :+for the WORM to eat the numbers appearing on the screen withou
          colliding with itself or the border around the screen. When a
          is eaten (by moving the WORM's head, denoted by a @, the numbe
          location) another number will appear at a random vacant locati
          The value of the eaten number will be added to the score and t
          WORM's length will also increase by that amount. Collisions ar
          denoted by a + then a * one second later, and cause the WORM t
          due to brain damage caused by shocking head injuries.
