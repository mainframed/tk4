  Purpose :    Routine to read sequentially an entire O.S. catalog.
  ---------    A DD-card, written as below, is needed to define
               the desired volume on which the O.S. catalog resides :

               //...     DD  UNIT=...,VOLUME=SER=...,DISP=OLD

               or the desired O.S. catalog :

               //...     DD  UNIT=...,VOLUME=SER=...,
               //            DSN=SYSCTLG,DISP=SHR

         Where : A - is the address of a field (format XL1,CL44) which
                     receives, after each read operation, unless when
                     the END-OF-FILE is detected, one of the following
                     information :

                      - a CVOL pointer name(format AL1(1),CL8).
                      - a DATA-SET name (format AL1(2),CL44).
                      - an ALIAS name, followed by the true name index
                        (format AL1(3),CL8,CL8).
                      - a null INDEX name (format AL1(128),CL8).
                      - an information continuation of a previous name
                        (format AL1(255),CL44).

                 B - is the address of a field (format CL6) which
                     receives the VOLUME SERIAL NUMBER relative
                     to the first argument if pertinent, otherwise
                     it is cleared to blanks. This argument is
                     optional and may be omitted or his address may
                     be set to zero in the parameters list.

                 C - is the address of a field (format XL4) which
                     receives the DEVICE TYPE relative to the second
                     argument if pertinent, otherwise it is cleared
                     to blanks. This argument is optional and may be
                     omitted or his address may be set to zero in the
                     parameters list.

         Note : the register 1 is always 0 (zero) at return, unless
                when a GENERATION DATA GROUP name has been builded,
                it is set to 1 (one). Be carefull that the condition
                is not maintained on eventual continuations.

                 D - is the indicator response (format FULLWORD - F
                     boundary) if supplied (optional). Value is always
                     placed in register 15 and can be :

                     the device, followed by a six characters field
                     containing the VOLUME SERIAL NUMBER of the
                     device. This argument is optional and may be
                     omitted or his address may be set to zero in the

                     omitted passing a zero parameters list pointer,
                     register 1, when the next is also omitted, or his
