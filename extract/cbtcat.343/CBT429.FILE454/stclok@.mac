  Calling sequence : CALL STCLOK
  ------------------

         Starting point for a clock interval measurement.

  Calling sequence : CALL TIME,(A,B),VL
  ------------------           (A)

         Where : A and optionally B are the addresses of fullwords
                 (F boundary) receiving the CPU time in seconds and
                 the number of I/O in thousands (SRB time in seconds),
                 floating point single precision expressed, interval
                 measured between the starting point (STCLOK call)
                 and this point (TIME call).

  How to use :
  ------------

         If A and B arguments are supplied, you receive the CPU time
               in A and the I/O number in B for the elapsed interval.
         If A argument only, you get the sum CPU time and I/O number.
