  Calling sequence : CALL READ,(A,B,C),VL
  ------------------           (A,B)
                               (A)

         Where : A - is the address of an array (format CL...) which
                     receives the text image.

                 B - is the address of the DD-name (format CL8) if
                     supplied (optional). When this argument is
                     omitted, or the address of this argument is
                     set to zero in the parameters list, the
                     default DD-name used is SYSIN.

                 C - is the address of the indicator response (format
                     FULLWORD - F boundary) if supplied (optional).
                     Value is always placed in register 15 and can be :

                     -1 - END-OF-FILE.
                      0 - READ correctly executed.
                      1 - DD-card missing.
                      2 - OPEN error or not fixed record format.
                      3 - calling sequence or argument alignment error.
                      4 - READ error.

                 --- If the routine is re-called after IND = 1 or 2,
                     the program is sended in abend U0001. If the
                     indicator response is detected 10 times different
                     from 0, the program is sended in abend U0002.

  Assembler macro : $READ A,B,C
  -----------------

         Where B and/or C are optional and may be omitted.
         Register use may be coded within parentheses.

                                                      READ      2/2.

  Calling sequence : CALL RCLOSE,(A,B),VL
  ------------------             (A)

         Where : A - is the address of the DD-name (format CL8) to
                     close. If this argument contains the CLOSEALL
                     keyword, or the address of this argument is
                     set to zero in the parameters list, or the
                     parameters list pointer (register 1) is zero,
                     all the opened files are closed.

                 B - is the address of the indicator response (format
                     FULLWORD - F boundary) if supplied (optional).
                     Value is always placed in register 15 and can be :

                      0 - CLOSE correctly executed.
                      1 - calling sequence, argument alignment or
                          DD-name error.

  Assembler macro : $RCLOSE A,B
  -----------------

         Where A and/or B are optional and may be omitted.
         Register use may be coded within parentheses.


  General notice : on any error detection, a message is included
  ================ in the message class for the job.
                   This routine is multi-files usable, that means
                   multi-files opened concurrently (using the DD-name
                   argument).


  How to suppress the DD-CARD MISSING message.
  --------------------------------------------

         Before entering the first time the READ routine for a file
  (DD-name), execute the following two instructions :
                     ...
                     L     RX,=V(#RMSW#)
                     MVI   0(RX),1
                     ...
         Then if ERR-1 occurs during the first CALL (OPEN file time),
  the message is bypassed (the register 15 and the eventual indicator
  response are set).
