  CBT origin : Extracted from CBT tape 91 MAR, file 124.
  ------------ (RESETGDG program, GDGUTIL ISPF procedure and GDGUTILP
               ISPF panel)
               Modified by : MOINIL P.A. (8 OCT 1991)
               (members were renamed : PAJCGDG, PAJGDG and GDGRESET)

  Purpose :    This program is used with the GDGUTIL (PAJCGDG) CLIST
  ---------    and the GDGUTILP (PAJGDG) ISPF panel to modify the
               number of entries being kept for a GDG Index.

  Function :   Reset number of entries in a GDG (MVS version operates
  ----------       on both CVOLS and VSAM/ICF catalogs).
               Input existing GDG name at SYSIN (DD-name=GDGIN) :
                   GDG name (maximum 44 characters long) followed by
                     the new number of entries (maximum 3 digits long),
                     eventually followed by the EM/NE (EMPTY/NOEMPTY)
                     and/or SC/NS (SCRATCH/NOSCRATCH) option(s).
                   These must be separated by one space at least, and
                     in the range of columns 1 - 72 included.
               Entries must be > 2 and < 255.
               Multiple records may be input.
               Default options are "NOEMPTY" and "SCRATCH".
               Any error will cause further records not be processed.
               Entering DLX in entries field will cause Index deletion.
               ** WARNING ** As of yet, this program will not handle
                   data-sets reseding on more than 20 volumes.
                   Only the first 20 volumes will be recataloged.
                   So, for security reasons, you should first list
                   the GDG you are planning to reset.
               This program always scratches DISK data-sets as it
                   uncataloges them, unless specifically requested by
                   the use of option NS (NOSCRATCH).
