  Calling sequence : CALL SRCHRPI,(A,B,C),VL
  ------------------              (A,B)

         Where : A - is the address of a 1-byte field containing the
                     length-1 of the immediately following characters
                     field giving the reply message identification
                     text (must be at least 8-characters long) used
                     to find the pending reply.
                     I.e. : R1 --> DC A(A) -->    A DC AL1(L'TEXT-1)
                                               TEXT DC C'...'

                 B - is the address of a 2-characters field into which
                     the requested pending reply-ID number is edited.

                 C - is the indicator response (format FULLWORD - F
                     boundary) if supplied (optional). Value is always
                     placed in register 15 and can be :

                          0 = reply-ID number edited.
                          4 = pending reply not found.
                          8 = calling sequence, parameter alignment or
                              invalid error.

  Assembler macro : $SRPI A,B,C
