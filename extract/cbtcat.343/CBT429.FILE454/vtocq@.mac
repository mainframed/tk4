  Purpose :    This routine reads the Volume Table of Contents (VTOC)
  ---------    from a direct-access device and presents it to the
               caller one record (DSCB) at a time (it is a special
               sequential access method for VTOC's).
               Its advantage over ordinary BSAM is that it reads an
               entire track in one revolution, thus saving considerable
               time. A DD-card, written as below, is needed to define
               the desired volume :

               //...     DD  UNIT=...,VOLUME=SER=...,DISP=OLD

  Calling sequence : CALL VTOCQR,(A,B,C),VL
  ------------------             (A,B)
                                 (A)

         Where : A - is the address of an array (format FULLWORD -
                     F boundary) which receives the DSCB's record
                     (140 bytes long).

                 B - is the address of the current DSCB record, in the
                     format MBBCCHHR (format XL8), returned after each
                     read operation, unless when the END-OF-FILE is
                     detected or a pseudo format 5 DSCB is passed back
                     by the indexed VTOC interface routine (IXTOFMT5)
                     if it has been generated (the MBBCCHHR is set to
                     all x'FF'). This argument is optional and may be
                     omitted or his address may be set to zero in the
                     parameters list.

                 C - is the indicator response (format FULLWORD - F
                     boundary) if supplied (optional). Value is always
                     placed in register 15 and can be :

                     -1 - END-OF-FILE detected. When an indexed VTOC is
                          processed, at END-OF-FILE return, the register
                          0 points to two fullwords which are containing
                          the counts of the free (FMT 0) DSCBs and the
                          free VIRS respectively.
                          With normal VTOC, register 0 is set to zero.
                      0 - READ operation correctly executed.
                      1 - READ error.
                      2 - file not opened.
                      3 - calling sequence or argument alignment error.
                     NN - indexed VTOC interface routine return code
                          (if it has been requested at the assembly),
                          with R0 = error information (IXTOFMT5).

                     Note - on permanent I/O error, the KEY and DATA
                            areas will be set to zeros, The COUNT area
                            will contain the correct CCHHR. Since
                            reading is done a track at a time, all
                            DSCB's for that track will be marked in
                            error. Reading may continue on to the next
                            track.

                     five fullwords information as described in DEVTYPE

                     containing the number of alternate tracks for
                     the device, followed by a six characters field
                     containing the volume serial number of the
                     device. This argument is optional and may be
