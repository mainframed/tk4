  Routine :      FINDMEM
  Author :       Jeff Sprehn
  Agency :       WDPSC
  Origin :       Extracted from tape CBT 89 FEB, file 270
  Language :     Assembler
  Run mode :     Batch or Interactive
  Attributes :   Re-enterable
  Function :     Subroutine to be called by high level language
                 program to determine whether a specified member
                 exists in a given PDS data-set.

  This is a subroutine which dynamically allocates the DSN passed to
  it and then searches the directory to determine whether the member
  name passed to it exists or not.

  To call this routine from a COBOL program, do the following :
       1. If your data-set is cataloged :
          MOVE your data-set name
               TO DSNAME OF FINDMEM-I-O-AREA.
          MOVE your member name
               TO MEMBER-NAME OF FINDMEM-I-O-AREA.
          CALL 'FINDMEM' USING FINDMEM-I-O-AREA.
       2. If your data-set is NOT cataloged :
          MOVE your data-set name
               TO DSNAME OF FINDMEM-I-O-AREA.
          MOVE your member name
               TO MEMBER-NAME OF FINDMEM-I-O-AREA.
          MOVE your volume serial number
               TO VOL-SER-NO.
          CALL 'FINDMEM' USING FINDMEM-I-O-AREA
                               VOL-SER-NO.
       Place the following data areas in WORKING STORAGE :
          01  FINDMEM-I-O-AREA.
              05  OP-SYS VALUE 'VS'   PIC X(2).
              05  MEMBER-NAME         PIC X(8).
              05  DSNAME              PIC X(44).
              05  SUCCESS-INDICATOR   PIC 99.
          01  VOL-SER-NO     PIC X(6).

  SUCCESS-INDICATOR   MEANING

                        this routine
