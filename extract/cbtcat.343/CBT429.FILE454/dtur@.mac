  Purpose :    This routine allows an easier way to use the dsect's
  ---------    tables which are created by the "GDTUTIL" program.
               Note : the routine is serially reusable.

  Calling sequence : CALL DTUSE,(A,B),VL
  ------------------            (A)

         Where : A - is the address of a variable number of consecutive
                     fields (numbered by @) information as below
                       @-1 (AL1) = a function code which
                         if = 0 (START), then
                           @-2 (AL1) = data-set name length
                           @-3 (CL...) = data-set name
                         if = 1 (SEARCH) or 2 (LIST), then
                           @-2 (CL8) = dsect table name
                           @-3 (CL8) = dsect field name
                           @-4 (XL2) = field displacement value
                           @-5 (XL2) = field name length value
                           @-6 (CL8) = flag name
                           @-7 (XL2) = flag value
                           @-8 (XL2) = flag name length value
                         if = 64 (RD-DIR), then
                           @-2 (CL8) = dsect name
                           @-3 (cl8) = alias of name
                         if = 127 (MOD-ID), then
                           @-2 (CL8) = dsect table name
                           @-3 (CL8) = dsect macro name
                           @-4 (CL16) = date and time of assembly
                                        (format is ' MM/DD/YY HH.MM ')
                         if = 128 (STATS), then
                           @-2 (XL4) = total number of loads
                           @-3 (XL4) = total load-modules length
                                           in double-words
                           Note : counters are reset at END
                         if = 255 (END), then none
                     (no alignment required)

                                                      DTUR      2/3.

                 B - is the address of the indicator response (format
                     XL4, no alignment) if supplied (optional).
                     Value is always placed in register 15 and can be :
                      0 - operation correctly ended.
                      4 - operation may continue when SEARCH function
                          (by field name or displacement, flag value),
                          RD-DIR function or LIST function.
                      8 - a warning error has been detected.
                     12 - a severe error has been detected.
                     At exit and only when an error is detected (RC 8
                     or 12), the register 1 contains a pointer to a
                     message text as follows
                     R1 --->     DC AL1(L'MSG)
                             MSG DC C'...error message text...'

  How-to-use the various functions of this routine :
  --------------------------------------------------
    A. - as first operation you must call the START function, then
    B. - use the SEARCH function to obtain information about a field
         name, a field displacement, a flag name or a flag value in a
         dsect. The request can be done as follows :
         1. specify the dsect name and a field name (@-2 and @-3, @-6
            must be blank) to receive back the field values (@-4 and
            @-5). If RC=0, the field has no flags defined, but if RC=4,
            then you may continue (retain @-2 to @-8 as they are) to
            receive back the flags name and values (@-6, @-7 and @-8)
            until RC=0 which say you no more.
         2. specify the dsect name and a field displacement value (@-2
            and @-4, @-3 and @-6 must be blank) to receive back the
            field name and length (@-3 and @-5). As long as RC=4, you
            may continue to get all fields names (retain @-2 to @-8 as
            they are) having the same displacement in the dsect, until
            RC=0 which say you no more.
         3. specify the dsect name and a flag name (@-2 and @-6, @-3
            must be blank) to receive back the field name, values and
            the flag values (@-3, @-4, @-5, @-7 and @-8).
         4. specify the dsect name, a field name and a flag value (@-2,
            @-3 and @-7, @-6 must be anything but not blank) to receive
            the flag names (@-6, also passed back @-4, @-5 and @-8).
            As long as RC=4, you may continue to get all flags names
            (retain @-2 to @-8 as they are) having the same value in
            the field of the dsect, until RC=0 which say you no more.
            Note : the field name where the flag value is searched must
                   be known.

    C. - or use the LIST function for a dsect (@-2) to receive back
         sequentially all the fields (flag name, @-6 is blank, and
         values, @-7 and @-8 are zero) and flags (field name, @-3 is
         blank, and values, @-4 and @-5 are zero) which are defined
         in the dsect. The LIST may continue until RC=4 (retain @-2 to
         @-8 as they are) and is terminated when RC=0.
    D. - or use the READ-DIR function to receive back sequentially all
         the dsect names (@-2, @-3 is blank) or the alias names (@-2)
         of a dsect name (@-3). The READ-DIR may continue until RC=4
         (retain @-2 and @-3 as they are) and is terminated when RC=0.
    E. - or use the MODULE-ID function to obtain the dsect macro name
         (@-3) and the date/time (@-4) of the module assembly for a
         specific dsect name(@-2).
    F. - at any time, you may use the STATS function to control how the
         space needed for tables has grown.
    G. - finally call the END function to terminate the processing. At
         this point, if desired, you may recall the routine to START a
         new process again. Note, this is the way to free all core
         storage space and start again with the same or another dsects
         tables data-set.
