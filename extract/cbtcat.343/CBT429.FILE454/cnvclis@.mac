  FUNCTION : program to convert CLISTs from 255 LRECL VB to 80 LRECL FB
             or vice versa.

  I/O :  SYSUT1 = input CLISTs.
         SYSUT2 = output CLISTs.
         SYSPRINT = listing.

  NOTES : - VB CLISTs have sequence numbers in pos. 1-8, FB in 73-80.
          - All input members (CLISTs) are added to output data-set
            unless duplicate names.

  RETURN CODE :  0 = job terminated successfully.
                 8 = job terminated before start of copy.
                12 = job terminated after start of copy.

  JCL :  //...      EXEC PGM=CNVCLIST
         //SYSUT1     DD DSN=...input data-set...,DISP=SHR
         //SYSUT2     DD DSN=...output data-set...,DISP=OLD
         //SYSPRINT   DD SYSOUT=A
