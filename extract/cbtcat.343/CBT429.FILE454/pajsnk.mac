%Object :+to pick up as many $25 bundles as possible and make it "home"
          being eaten by the snake. Money is denoted by a $, the player
          "home" by #, and the snake by a string of S's in lower case, w
          snake's head being in upper case. Each time the player moves t
          moves. At first the snake will move almost randomly, but will
          "intelligent" move more often as the game progresses. When the
          gets "home" the game ends and the score is credited. If the pl
          gets "eaten" then the game ends and no score is credited.
