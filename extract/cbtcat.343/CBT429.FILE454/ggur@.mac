  Calling sequence : CALL GGUR,(A,B,C),VL
  ------------------ CALL GGUR,(A,B),VL

         Where : A - is the address of the desired RACF GROUP name
                     (format CL8). This argument is mandatory, and
                     must be right padded with blanks.

                 B - is the address of an array into which the USERIDs
                     part of the requested RACF GROUP are stored. The
                     format is as follows :
                             DC  AL2(no. of USERIDs or zero)
                             DC  CL8'1st USERID'
                             DC  CL8'2nd USERID'
                             ...
                             DC  CL8'nth USERID'
                     The array must be large enough to receives the
                     maximum number of USERIDs for a RACF GROUP, unless
                     unpredictable results may occur.
                     This argument is mandatory.

                 C - is the address of the indicator response (format
                     FULLWORD - F boundary) if supplied (optional).
                     Value is always placed in register 15 and can be :

                     -1 - GROUP name not found.
                      0 - request correctly exhausted.
                      1 - RACF inactive.
                      2 - region space too small.
                      3 - RACF read type GRP error.
                      4 - RACF-GRP no data returned back.
                      5 - GROUPs/USERIDs table overflow.
                      6 - table empty, no GROUPs.
                      7 - calling sequence or argument error.

         Where C is optional and may be omitted.
         Register use may be coded within parentheses.

  Calling sequence : CALL GGUCL,(A),VL
  ------------------ CALL GGUCL ---> with R1=0

         Where : A - is the address of the indicator response (format
                     FULLWORD - F boundary) if supplied (optional).
                     Value is always placed in register 15 and can be :

                      0 - internal RACF table space released.
                      1 - calling sequence or argument error.

  Assembler macro : $GGUCL A
  -----------------

         Where A is optional and may be omitted.
         Register use may be coded within parentheses.


  NOTES : 1. On any error detection, a message is included in the
  =======    message class for the job.
          2. At the first call of GGUR, an internal table is builded
             with all the RACF GROUPs/USERIDs. At execution end, call
             GGUCL to release this space.
