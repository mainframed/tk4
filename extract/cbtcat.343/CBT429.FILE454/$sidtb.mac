* I/O TO SRB TIME EVALUATION :
* ----------------------------
*
*        ONE (1) SECOND OF SRB TIME IS EQUIVALENT TO THE EXECUTION OF
*        THOUSAND (1000) I/O OPERATIONS (IN THE WORST CASE), BUT THIS
*        IS CPU DEPENDENT, AND THE REAL SRB TIME MAY VARY WITH TRACE
*        ON OR OFF, ACCESS METHOD AND/OR PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE USED
*        (I.E., THE ASSEMBLER IS NORMALLY MORE THAN TWICE FASTER).
*        IN A COMPLEX OF COMPUTERS, OFTEN ALL OF THESE ARE NOT THE
*        SAME MODEL AND THUS NOT SAME CPU SPEED. TO REFLECT THIS
*        SITUATION, A SYSTEM SPEED FACTOR IS APPLIED TO THE JOB SRB
*        TIME (I/O) IN ORDER TO EXTEND IT IN CORRESPONDENCE TO THE
*        FASTEST SYSTEM IN THE COMPLEX.
*        I.E.- IF A SYSTEM-A IS THE FASTEST SYSTEM AND A SYSTEM-B
*              NEEDS TWICE THE CPU-TIME THAN THE SYSTEM-A FOR A JOB
*              EXECUTION, THEN SET THE SYSTEM-A SPEED FACTOR TO 1000000
*              AND THE SYSTEM-B SPEED FACTOR TO 2000000.
