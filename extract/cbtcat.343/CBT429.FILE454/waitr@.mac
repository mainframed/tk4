   Function :  The WAITR command returns information reguarding ENQ
   ----------  conflicts for a JOB or USERID. It tells you what
               data-set(s) the job is waiting on, and how it is waiting
               (old or share). It will also tell what data-set the job
               or user holds that other jobs may be waiting on. Once
               this is known a command such as TSODSN can be used to
               see who has the data-set tied up or who is waiting on
               it. At this point the FREE or FREEALL commands can be
               used to free it.
   Outputs :   WAITING OLD FOR DSN = XYZ.ABC.DEF
                    means the job scanned wants XYZ.ZBC.DEF old,
                    someone has it shared.
               WAITING SHR FOR DSN = ABC.DEF.GHI
                    means the job scanned wants ABC.DEF.GHI shared,
                    someone has it old.
               WAITING FOR DSN = ABC.TRS.XYZ, ALLOCATED SHR
                    means the job scanned has data-set ABC.TRS.XYZ
                    allocated share, at least one job wants it old.
               WAITING FOR DSN = DEF.ABC.GHI, ALLOCATED OLD
                    means the job scanned has data-set DEF.ABC.GHI
                    allocated old, at least one job wants it shared.
   Return codes :   0 - indicates JOB or USER found in execution.
                        All conflicts (if any) have been listed.
                    4 - indicates JOB or USER not found in execution.
                   16 - Indicates error occurred, re-enter command.
