  Function :   performs the ENCRYPTION or DECRYPTION of data operating
  ----------   as a primary command under ISPF/PDF EDIT.

  Operation :  the ENCRYPTION or DECRYPTION is performed by utilizing a
  -----------  key value supplied as an operand of the primary command.

  Command syntax :      !CRY ENCRYPT,KEYVALUE         !CRY HELP
  ----------------           or EN                      or H
                                E
                        !CRY DECRYPT,KEYVALUE
                             or DE
                                D
               the KEYVALUE is a user supplied keyword which is used
               as ENCRYPT/DECRYPT code value. The keyword is limited
               to eight (8) bytes in length, but may be shorter.
               When the KEYVALUE operand of the primary command is
               omited, you are prompted to supply it unviewable (i.e.
               when entering "!CRY E" only).

  Warning :  If you forget the KEYVALUE that you used to encipher the
  ---------  data, KISS THE DATA GOOD-BYE because there is no way of
             deciphering the data again.
             If you are hopelessly paranoid, you can encipher the
             enciphered data with a different KEYVALUE to really grunge
             up the data. The decipherion process must be the exact
             inverse of the encipher process in order to recover the
             original data again.

  Examples : 1) to encipher the data with the key of ALPHA, type :
  ----------                 !CRY E,ALPHA
                and to get it back to clear text again, type :
                             !CRY D,ALPHA
             2) to really garbage up the data with keys of ALPHA and
                BRAVO, type : !CRY E,ALPHA
                             and then after !CRY E,BRAVO
                and to decipher the text, just reverse the order as
                follows, type : !CRY D,BRAVO
                             and then after !CRY D,ALPHA

  Range :    You may also limit the encryption-decryption by marking a
  -------    range of lines of text with the "C" range command on the
             line numbers.
