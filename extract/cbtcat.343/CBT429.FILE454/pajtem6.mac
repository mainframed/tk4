%NULLS :+
   Use%NULLS+to turn NULLS mode on or off ("ON" is the default) and to
   indicate whether you want the display to be in STD or ALL mode (STD i
   the default).
   In STD mode, 3270 null characters replace all but the first trailing
   blank in each field on the screen. If a field is entirely blank, null
   characters are not substituted.
   In ALL mode, 3270 null characters replace all trailing blanks in each
   field on the screen, including fields that are entirely blank.

   More topic will be presented in the EDIT tutorial.
