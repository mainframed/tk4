%FUNCTION :+ These Edit macros perform the ENCRYPTION or DECRYPTION of d
             operating as a primary command under ISPF-PDF EDIT.
%OPERATION :+the ENCRYPTION or DECRYPTION is performed by utilizing a KE
             you are prompted to supply it unviewable. The KEY-VALUE is
             supplied keyword which is used as ENCRYPT-DECRYPT code valu
             keyword is limited to eight bytes in length, but may be sho
%SYNTAX :+      ENCRYPT or               DECRYPT or
                ENCRYPT HELP or H        DECRYPT HELP or H
%WARNING :+  If you forget the KEY-VALUE that you used to encipher the d
             KISS THE DATA GOOD-BYE because there is no way of decipheri
             data again. If you are hopelessly paranoid, you can enciphe
             enciphered data with a different KEY-VALUE to really grunge
             data. The decipherion process must be the exact inverse of
             encipher process in order to recover the original data agai
%RANGE :+    You may also limit the encryption-decryption by marking a r
             lines of text with the "C" range command on the line number
