         This rouitne uses the CVAF service routines to convert the
   free space bit map of an indexed VTOC into pseudo format-5 DSCBs.
   This provides a compatibility interface function for PRE-DFDS
   routines which examine format-5 DSCBs.
         This routine is called once for each format-5 which must be
   built. The index record buffer returned by CVAF is saved so that
   no additional I/O need be done for succeeding calls. The buffers
   are freed when the last format-5 DSCB is returned. Hence, this
   ruotine should be called until a format-5 DSCB with DS5PTRDS equal
   to zero is returned. The non-zero value in DS5PTRDS will allways
   be C'00001'. No enqueue on the VTOC is performed.

   Input : R1 ---> (PARMLIST)
           A(WORD) ----- address of a fullword used by this routine.
                         Must be zeroed for first call and returned
                         unaltered thereafter.
           A(DCB) ------ address of a DCB opened to the desired VTOC.
                         No I/O may be outstanding to this DCB.
           A(COUNT1) --- address of a fullword where count of the free
                         (FMT 0) DSCBs will be returned.
           A(COUNT2) --- address of a fullword where count of the free
                         VIRS will be returned.
           A(FMT5) ----- address of a 140-byte area for format-5 DSCB
                         built by this routine.

   Return codes :
         R15  = 0   all OK.
         R15  = 4   VTOC is not in indexed format. CVAFTST RC in reg 0.
         R15  = 8   CVAFTST call failed (other than not indexed format
                    VTOC). CVAFTST RC in reg 0.
         R15  = 12  CVAFDSM call failed (other than non indexed format
                    VTOC). CVAFDSM RC in high order byte of reg 0 (byte
                    0). CVSTAT in low order byte of reg 0 (byte 3).
                    CVAFDSM error ID in byte 1 of reg 0.
         R15  = 16  (unused)
         R15  = 20  logic error in this routine. CVAFDIR RC in high
                    order byte of reg 0 (byte 0). CVSTAT in low order
                    byte of reg 0 (byte 3).

   Attributes :    Reentrant, Problem state, Problem key. This
                   routine will work correctly on a non DFDS system.
                   However, DFDS macros are required for assembly.
