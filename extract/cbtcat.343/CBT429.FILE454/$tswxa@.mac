  Assembler macro : $TSWXA MODE,EXPAND=ALL,ASS=H,CVT=YES
  -----------------                    ONLY    F     NO

   Purpose : macro to test the current addressing mode or to switch
             between 24-bit and 31-bit addressing mode.
             It allows programs to run on MVS/370 and MVS/XA.

   MODE operand : the desired addressing mode to enter (24 or 31).
                  If SYSTEM is specified, only the test of the
                  current MVS version is executed. The condition
                  code is set as follows :
                       - 0 (ZERO) = MVS/370 version,
                       - 3 (ONE) = MVS/XA version.
                  If omited, than the test of current MVS version
                  and addressing mode is executed. The condition
                  code is set as follows :
                       - 0 (ZERO) = MVS/370 mode,
                       - 1 (MINUS) = MVS/XA 31-bit addressing mode,
                       - 2 (PLUS) = MVS/XA 24-bit addressing mode,
                  and the register 14 contains the current MVS version
                  and AMODE indicators as below :
                       - bit 0 : off = 24-bit AMODE,
                                 on = 31-bit AMODE,
                       - bit 1 : off = MVS/370,
                                 on = MVS/XA,
                       - the remaining bits (2-31) are binary zeroes.

   EXPAND operand : only used with MODE operand 24 or 31 to request
                  the full expansion (EXPAND=ALL, default) or only
                  the enter specific mode instructions (EXPAND=ONLY).

   ASS operand :  normally this macro needs assembler H (IEV90) for
                  BSM instruction (ASS=H), but the assembler F may
                  be used specifying ASS=F.

   CVT operand :  normally this macro refers to fields mapped by the
                  CVT macro (CVT=YES), but it may be suppressed when
                  specifying CVT=NO (absolute locations are used).

   NOTES - Register 14 is always altered.
         - If the Operating System does not support 31-bit addressing,
           or the current addressing mode is already that requested,
           no mode switch occurs.
