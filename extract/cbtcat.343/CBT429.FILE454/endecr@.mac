  Function :   performs the ENCRYPTION or DECRYPTION of data operating
  ----------   as a primary command under ISPF/PDF EDIT.

  Operation :  the ENCRYPTION or DECRYPTION is performed by utilizing a
  -----------  KEY-VALUE you are prompted to supply it unviewable.
               The KEY-VALUE is a user supplied keyword which is used
               as ENCRYPT/DECRYPT code value. The keyword is limited
               to eight (8) bytes in length, but may be shorter.

  Command syntax :      ENCRYPT or               DECRYPT or
  ----------------      ENCRYPT HELP or H        DECRYPT HELP or H

  Warning :  If you forget the KEY-VALUE that you used to encipher the
  ---------  data, KISS THE DATA GOOD-BYE because there is no way of
             deciphering the data again.
             If you are hopelessly paranoid, you can encipher the
             enciphered data with a different KEY-VALUE to really grunge
             up the data. The decipherion process must be the exact
             inverse of the encipher process in order to recover the
             original data again.

  Range :    You may also limit the encryption-decryption by marking a
  -------    range of lines of text with the "C" range command on the
             line numbers.
