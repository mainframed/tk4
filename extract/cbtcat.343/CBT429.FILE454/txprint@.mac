  Calling sequence : CALL PRINT,(A,B,C,D),VL
  ------------------            (A,B,C)
                                (A,B)
                                (A)

         Where : A - is the address of the text to be printed (the
                     first character must be ASA control character).

                 B - is the address of text length (no. of characters :
                     format FULLWORD - F boundary). When this argument
                     is omitted, or the address of this argument is
                     set to zero in the parameters list, the length of
                     the text is supposed to be in front of the text,
                     at the address of A-1 (format XL1).

                 C - is the address of the DD-name (format CL8) if
                     supplied (optional). When this argument is
                     omitted, or the address of this argument is set
                     to zero in the parameters list, the default
                     DD-name used is SYSPRINT.

                 D - is the address of the indicator response (format
                     FULLWORD - F boundary) if supplied (optional).
                     Value is always placed in register 15 and can be :

                      0 - PRINT correctly executed.
                      1 - DD-card missing.
                      2 - OPEN error, not ASA or LRECL too large.
                      3 - calling sequence or argument alignment error.
                      4 - length is negative, zero or greater than the
                          logical record length (maximum allowable is
                          145). The line is printed, but truncated.
                      5 - PRINT error.

                 --- If the routine is re-called after IND = 1 or 2,
                     the program is sended in abend U0001. If the
                     indicator response is detected 10 times different
                     from 0, the program is sended in abend U0002.

  Assembler macro : $PRINT A,B,C,D
  -----------------

         Where B, C and/or D are optional and may be omitted.
         Register use may be coded within parentheses.

                                                      PRINT     2/2.

  Calling sequence : CALL PCLOSE,(A,B),VL
  ------------------             (A)

         Where : A - is the address of the DD-name (format CL8) to
                     close. If this argument contains the CLOSEALL
                     keyword, or the address of this argument is set
                     to zero in the parameters list, or the parameters
                     list pointer (register 1) is zero, all the
                     opened files are closed.

                 B - is the address of the indicator response (format
                     FULLWORD - F boundary) if supplied (optional).
                     Value ia always placed in register 15 and can be :

                      0 - CLOSE correctly executed.
                      1 - calling sequence, argument alignment or
                          DD-name error.

  Assembler macro : $PCLOSE A,B
  -----------------

         Where A and/or B are optional and may be omitted.
         Register use may be coded within parentheses.


  General notice : on any error detection, a message is included
  ================ in the message class for the job.
                   This routine is multi-files usable, that means
                   multi-files opened concurrently (using the DD-name
                   argument).
