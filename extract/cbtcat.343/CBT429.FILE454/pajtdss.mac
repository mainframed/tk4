%Tutorial - STATDS - Data-set Statistics -------------------------------
+  This function formats information on any disk data-set. It reads thro
+  entire data-set and outputs disk track usage, blocksize and other sta
+  If a%no PARM+is coded, the following information will be given :
+      a) DCB and DSCB characteristics.
+      b) Record counts, record size, track usage statistics for any typ
+         data-set organization. For DSORG=IS, it reads through the enti
+         data-set (there may be up to three separate files of data and
+         on each file). Also, the ISAM label (format 2 DSCB) record wil
+         read and a data-set profile which includes data-set reorganiza
+         data and data-set characteristics will be provided.
+      c) For DSORG=PO, the directory TTR's will be compared against act
+         disk addresses to determine the TTRs of "gas" members (the fir
+         characters of any "gas" member are outputed). Statistics are
+         maintained on the size of "gas" and "real" members and the num
+         alias members. If any aliases are in the data-set, a check is
+         to see that corresponding real entries also exist.
+  A PARM of%'NO'+nullify the gas TTR report.
+  A PARM of%'LABEL'+give only DCB and DSCB characteristics.
+  A PARM of%'FULL'+supply the directory members list (only DSORG=PO).
+  A PARM of%'GAS(TT.TT.RR)'+add a member name to the directory for the
+      member having the specified TTR location (in HEX from a previous
+  Depress%PF3+or%PF15+to return to the%STATDS+panel.
