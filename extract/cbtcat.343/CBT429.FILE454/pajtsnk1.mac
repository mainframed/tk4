%Tutorial - SNAKE - A program for TSO 3270 terminals -------------------
+Notes  :+Any other input, or trying to move through an obstruction, is
          equivalent to standing still while the snake gets a move. Note
          running is stopped by an obstruction, but only after failing a
          attempt, thus giving the snake an extra move. Any snake trail
          present is cleared by a screen image RESHOW/REFRESH.
          Running can be speeded up by activating BURST MODE. When this
          consecutive running moves are displayed with one TPUT, thus op
          terminal I/O. However, depending upon the terminal and its con
          each individual move may be invisible and the user will be pre
          with the final screen image.
          If file ISPTABL is allocated, then the highest score is kept a
          data (PFD STATS, not SPF) of member SNKTAB## (REVIEW will show
          and SPF STATS) where ## is the number of lines that the screen
          If invoked as HALFSNAK or HS, then only the top half (integer
          arithmetic) of the screen will be used. Naturally a different
          scoreboard member will be used. Similarly with QUARTERS and QS
          If the terminal's VTAM QUERY bit is ON, then a QUERY will be d
          determine if 3270 Extended Data Stream data can be sent.
