         Sam,

         Yesterday, I have detected an error using the CUT macro in an
  ISPF/PDF Edit session. The symptoms I saw were i.e. :
         a) the data lines 11, 12, 13, ... of a previous stored CUT 1
            level are replaced by the data lines 1, 2, 3, ... of a new
            stored CUT 11 level, or
         b) the data lines 1, 2, 3, ... of a previous stored CUT 11
            level are canceled by the Deletion of a CUT 1 level.
         Now, I don't send you back all the files of my last version of
  1996, March 15, but just the corrected CUT macro (352 cards instead
  of 341 old version) which must replace that one in the SOURCE.FILE0
  (Basic Material) actually CBT tape version # 414, file 454.


                                       Sincerely,

                                          Paul
