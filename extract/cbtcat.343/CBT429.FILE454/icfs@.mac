  Purpose :    Routine to read sequentially an entire ICF catalog.
  ---------    A DD-card, written as below, is needed to define
               the desired catalog :

               //...     DD  DSN=...ICF catalog...,DISP=SHR

  Calling sequence : CALL ICFSR,(A,B,C,D),VL
  ------------------            (A,B,C)
                                (A,B)
                                (A)

         Where : A - is the address of a field (format XL1,CL44) which
                     receives, after each read operation, unless when
                     the END-OF-FILE is detected, one of the following
                     information :
                      - a NON-VSAM DATA-SET name (format AL1(1),CL44).
                      - a GDG DATA-SET name (format AL1(2),CL44).
                      - a CLUSTER name (format AL1(3),CL44).
                      - an ALTERNATE INDEX name (format AL1(4),CL44).
                      - a DATA (CLUSTER) name (format AL1(5),CL44).
                      - an INDEX (CLUSTER) name (format AL1(6),CL44).
                      - a PATH name (format AL1(7),CL44).
                      - an ALIAS name (format AL1(8),CL44).
                      - an AIX TRUE-NAME name (format AL1(9),CL44).
                      - a DATA TRUE-NAME name (format AL1(10),CL44).
                      - an INDEX TRUE-NAME name (format AL1(11),CL44).
                      - an ICF CONNECTOR name (format AL1(12),CL44).
                      - a VSAM CONNECTOR name (format AL1(13),CL44).
                      - an information continuation of a previous name
                        (format AL1(255),CL44).

                 B - is the address of a field (format CL6,XL2) which
                     receives the VOLUME SERIAL NUMBER relative
                     to the first argument if pertinent (otherwise
                     it is cleared to blanks), followed by the FILE
                     SEQUENCE NUMBER (only used for NON-VSAM tape, it
                     is cleared to binary zeros). This argument is
                     optional and may be omitted or his address may
                     be set to zero in the parameters list.

                 C - is the address of a field (format XL4) which
                     receives the DEVICE TYPE relative to the second
                     argument if pertinent, otherwise it is cleared
                     to blanks. This argument is optional and may be
                     omitted or his address may be set to zero in the
                     parameters list.

                 D - is the indicator response (format FULLWORD - F
                     boundary) if supplied (optional). Value is always
                     placed in register 15 and can be :
                     -1 - END-OF-FILE detected.
                          CLOSE catalog is ok (R0 and R1 = 0) or if
                          CLOSE error : R0 = VSAM CLOSE error code,
                                        R1 = CLOSE return code (R15).

                      3 - calling sequence or argument alignment error.

         NOTE : on all error return, the catalog file status remains
                unchanged (opened or closed).
