   Function : The JB command displays the CPU and SRB (I/O) time used
   ---------- by currently executing background jobs and/or foreground
              sessions (TSO-users), each followed between parentheses
              by the limit if available.

   Syntax :   JB JOB-list
   --------   Required : none.
              Default : current USERID and all the jobs which name
                        begins with USERID.
              Alias : none.

   Operands :
   ----------
  JOB-list  - A list of one or more names used to search the executing
              jobs/sessions queue (when more names are entered, they
              must be enclosed in parentheses and separated each from
              the other by a comma).
              A name shorter than 8 characters long is assumed to be
              a request of notices about all jobs/sessions which names
              starts by this prefix.
              ---------------------------------------------
              Only info about executing jobs are displayed.
              ---------------------------------------------
              Jobs in waiting for execution or in output queues are
              not searched (use the STATUS command).
              The jobs/sessions accumulated CPU and SRB (I/O) time are
              displayed in the form :
                   HH:MM:SS.TH (hours:minutes:seconds.tenths),
              and the limits are displayed in the form :
                   HH:MM:SS (hours:minutes:seconds).
              For background jobs the name of the currently executing
              step or procedure step is displayed, and for foreground
              sessions the name of the currently executing command is
              displayed (blanks means terminal waiting for user input).
              If session STARTING, the physical terminal address (if
              available) is displayed in the from T#XXX.
