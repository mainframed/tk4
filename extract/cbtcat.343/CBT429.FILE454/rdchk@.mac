  Calling sequence : CALL RDCHK,(A,B,C),VL
  ------------------            (A,B)

         Where : A - is the address of an array (format FULLWORD - F
                     boundary) large enough to receive the longest
                     record from the tape file, which the DDNAME must
                     be passed to the routine at the first time it is
                     called. The DDNAME is assumed be placed in the
                     first eight bytes of the array.

                 B - is the address of the current record length
                     (format FULLWORD - F boundary) returned by the
                     routine after each read operation, unless when
                     the END-OF-FILE is detected.

                 C - is the address of the indicator response (format
                     FULLWORD - F boundary) if supplied (optional).
                     Value is laways placed in register 15 and can be :

                      0 - READ operation correctly executed.
                      1 - READ operation has terminated with permanent
                          redundancy. The record is in the array as it
                          has been read in core storage.
                      2 - END-OF-FILE detected. The first four bytes
                          in the array (first fullword) contains the
                          number of records correctly read, and the
                          following four bytes (second fullword)
                          contains the number of erroneous records
                          encountered.
                      3 - calling sequence or argument alignment error.
                      4 - DD-card missing, not tape or OPEN error.

                      --- If the routine detects an unexpected error,
                          the program is sended in abend U0001.
                          This routine is only serially multi-files
                          usable.

                                                      RDCHK     2/2.

  Purpose : This is a routine to read a 9-tracks tape file containing
  --------- some erroneous records (permanent redundancies like data
            checks), and thus giving the opportunity to correct or
            supply information.

            The following DD-card is needed to read the tape file :

            //........ DD UNIT=TAPE,VOL=(PRIVATE,RETAIN,SER=......),
            //            DISP=(OLD,PASS),LABEL=(...,NL,,IN)

  Assembler macro : $RDCHK A,B,C

         Where C is optional and may be omitted.
         Register use may be coded within parentheses.
