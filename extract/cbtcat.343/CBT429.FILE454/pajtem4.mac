%CAPS :+
   Use%CAPS+to turn CAPS mode off or on ("ON" is the default).
   If CAPS mode is on, edit translates all lower case data that is read
   the display into upper case. If CAPS mode is off, data read from the
   left unchanged. If the data being edited contains lower case data, it
   not be changed unless it is written to the 3270 screen and then read
   Since data is read back by field, only fields that have been changed
   be translated to upper case.

   More topic will be presented in the EDIT tutorial.
