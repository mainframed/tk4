  Purpose :
  ---------

     This routine will function only in OS/VS2 Release 2 and later
  releases (i.e. MVS). It allows the user to perform any one of the
  following operations :

         1.    Dynamically allocate an existing disk data-set. Any
                           disk data-set, including an ISAM data-set,
                           may be allocated.

         2.    Dynamically allocate a new disk data-set. Any valid
                           disk data-set organization except ISAM
                           may be specified.

         3.    Dynamically allocate a DD DUMMY data-set.

         4.    Dynamically de-allocate a previous allocation.

     It is assumed that the user of this routine has a good working
  knowledge of OS/VS2 JCL as described in the OS/VS2 JCL manual
  (GC28-1300). The user of this routine will build a list of
  parameters in much the same way as he would fill out a DD-card.
     The information in the parameter list will be used to do the
  requested function.

     The linkage to this routine can be made with a standard OS
  CALL; LINK or ATTACH. The address list specified in the CALL
  (or LINK or ATTACH) must always include the address of the
  parameter list (described below) as its first or only entry.
  The second (optional) address in the list must be the address
  of 2 consecutive fullwords in the caller's program. Register 13
  must contain the address of a standard OS save area. Examples
  of CALL's are shown below.

         CALL  DYNALL,(DYNLIST),VL
         CALL  DYNALL,(DYNLIST,RCODES),VL

  Assembler macro : $DYNALL A,B

         Where B is optional and may be omitted.
         Register use may be coded within parentheses.

     Upon return from this routine, R0 and R15 will contain codes
  indicating how the request completed. If the second item is named
  in the address list, then the values placed in R0 and R15 will
  also be stored in its first and second words, respectively. This
  will allow programs written in cobol or other high level languages
  to use this routine. Detailed information about the return codes is
  given following the information about the parameter list.

     This routine is re-enterable.

  Dynamic allocation parameter list :
  -----------------------------------

         Unless otherwise noted, the following is true for all
         information you place in the parameter list.

         1.    Coding a parameter in the parameter list has the same
               effect as coding the same parameter in a JCL DD-card.

         2.    If a parameter is to be omitted, its corresponding
               field should be left blank.

         3.    Omitting a parameter from the list has the same effect
               as omitting the same parameter from a JCL DD-card. In
               particular, if omitting a parameter from a JCL DD-card
               would cause a default to be taken, then omitting the
               parameter from the list will cause the same default to
               be taken.

         4.    All parameters should be left justified and padded
               with blanks. Numeric values may contain leading
               zeros.

         5.    Fields within the parameter list will be unchanged
               by this routine.

  Assembler macro : $DYNLIST

         Use this macro to obtain the dynamic allocation parameter
         list dummy section as described below.

  DDNAME          8        Required for all functions. This must be
                           the same as the DDNAME parameter of the
                           ACB or DCB that will be used to process
                           the data-set.

  DSNAME         44        This field must be filled in with the
                           correct DSNAME when allocating an existing
                           data-set or when creating a new permanent
                           data-set. When allocating a new temporary
                           data-set it may be left blank or filled in
                           with an &&DSNAME in a manner identical
                           to requesting a temporary data-set in JCL.
                           If NULLFILE is used as a DSNAME, a dummy
                           data-set is allocated. If this field is
                           filled in with all X'00', a previously
                           allocated data-set with the same DDNAME
                           will be de-allocated. The data-set name
                           specified in this field must not be a
                           backward reference (i.e. must not be
                           *.DDNAME, *.STEPNAME.DDNAME or
                           *.STEPNAME.PROCSTEPNAME.DDNAME). This
                           field should not contain a member name or
                           a generation number. Use the DSMEMBER
                           field to specify that information.

                           Note : when allocation is for a dummy file
                                 (i.e. when DSNAME is NULLFILE) only
                                 the DDNAME, DSNAME, DSFREE and
                                 DCB information is used by this
                                 module. Any other information is
                                 ignored.
                                 When de-allocation is requested (i.e.
                                 when DSNAME is all X'00') only the
                                 DDNAME, DSNAME and DSUFORCE
                                 information are used by this module.
                                 Any other information is ignored.

  DSMEMBER        8        Use this field to specify a member of a
                           PDS or to specify the generation number
                           of a generation data-set group. Do not
                           use parentheses (e.g. specify +1 not
                           (+1) ).

  PASSWORD        8        Use this field to specify the password for
                           an existing password protected data-set.
                           There is no JCL equivalent for this
                           parameter.

                           field may also be set to all X'00', in
                           that case this routine will SET this field
                           to the data-set VOLUME SERIAL NUMBER.

  DSVOLREF       44        Specifying a DSNAME in this field is
                           equivalent to coding VOL=REF=DSNAME in
                           a JCL DD-card. Note thst the value given
                           here must always be a catalogued data-set
                           (i.e. it cannot be a PASSed data-set nor

                           fields are mutually exclusive except when
                           DSVOLSER has been coded as all X'00'.

  DSFREE          8        This field is equivalent to the FREE

                           the following : DA, DAU, IS, ISU, PO,
                           POU, PS, PSU or VSAM. If this module
                           cannot determine the data-set organization,
                           it will not change the field.

  DSKEYLEN        3        The data-set KEY LENGTH. The value must be

                           cannot be coded.

  Return codes :
  --------------

     This routine uses the dynamic allocation routine described in
  the OS/VS2 Systems Programming Library : JOB MANAGEMENT manual
  (GC28-1303), and in MVS/XA Systems Programming Library: System
  Macros and Facilieties, Volume 1 (GC28-1150).
     This routine does some preliminary editing prior
  to requesting dynamic allocation. If it finds some error which
  prevents completion of the request, it will place 15 (decimal)
  in R15. R0 will contain an offset from the beginning of the
  parameter list to show which field is in error. For example,
  if the DSNDISP field contains PASS (which is invalid), R0 will
  contain 76 (decimal) and R15 will contain 15 (decimal).

     Unless this routine detects an error, it will make a request
  to the dynamic allocation routine. The dynamic allocation routine
  issues a return code in R15 and also gives an ERROR REASON CODE
  and an INFORMATIONAL REASON CODE. Each of the two REASON CODES
  is 2 bytes long. This routine will place the ERROR REASON CODE
  in the first 2 bytes of R0 and the INFORMATIONAL REASON CODE in
  the second 2 bytes of R0. This routine will leave the dynamic
  allocation return code in R15. The meaning of these codes can be
  found in the manual (GC28-1303) mentioned above.

     It will always be possible to know the meaning of an R0 return
  code (i.e. does it contain an offset or does it contain reason
  codes), since the dynamic allocation routine never issues a 15
  (decimal) return code. Therefore, when R15 contains 15 (decimal),
  R0 must contain an offset.

     If the program that invokes this routine passes 2 addresses in
  its address list, this routine will place the contents of R0 and R15
  in the first and second fullwords, respectively, of the second item
  in the address list.
