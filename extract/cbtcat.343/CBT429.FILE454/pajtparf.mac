 %RH      +Remove Hyphens and reconnect words
           Remove Hyphens means if you have one word split across multip
           nes with a hyphen (like li- nes in this sentence), the hyphen
           will be removed and the word will be reconnected into one wor
           lines) before reformatting occurs.
           Why have this routine ? Two reasons :
            (1) Suppose you made an error previously when you executed P
                making NL and NR too close together. If PARA finds a wor
                cannot fit between NL and NR, PARA splits the word into
                more pieces, hyphenating them. Many words might have bee
                into pieces. This routine makes recovery easy : just exe
                PARA with the correct NL/NR pair and RH.
            (2) Suppose you are modifying old text, with many words hyph
                Your changes will shift the position of the hyphenated w
                within the paragraph, moving the hyphenated words to the
                of the line. This routine saves a lot of manual unhyphen
                time.
