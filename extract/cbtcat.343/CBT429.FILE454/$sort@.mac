  Purpose :   Sort in ascending order (one control field only) an
  ---------   array of fixed elements (uses a SHELL SORT).

  Syntax :    $SORT TB,NE,LE,SF,LF,NOTES=YES
  --------

  Operands :  TB - array starting address (register use may be
  ----------       coded within parentheses).
              NE - number of elements in the array to be sorted
                   (register use may be coded within parentheses).
              LE - length of an element. The value must be in the
                   range 1 to 256 included.
              SF - starting position of the control field in the
                   array's elements, assuming the first position
                   of an element known as 0 (zero). The value
                   must be in the range 0 to 255 included.
              LF - length in characters of the control field. The
                   value must be in the range 1 to 256 included.
              NOTES=YES - generate inline this text. default is NO.

  Control :   It is user responsability to verify the following
  ---------   expressions (unless the results are unpredictables) :

                      1.  1 <= "LE" <= 256
                      2.  0 <= "SF" <= 255
                      3.  1 <= "LF" <= 256
                      4.  "SF" + "LF" <= "LE"

  Note :      The inline generated coding saves and restores the
  ------      needed registers contents (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 14 and 15)
              in the current save area (pointed by register 13), and
              assumes that the base register is not one of these.
