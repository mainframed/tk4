  Function :   This Edit macro may be used to
  ----------   1 - write lines from a file to the user profile POOL
                   for later inclusion by the INSERT option, or
               2 - write lines from the user profile POOL into the
                   current file (INSERT option), or
               3 - delete CUT data in the various levels of CUT in the
                   user profile POOL, or
               4 - show CUT data in the various levels of CUT in the
                   user profile POOL, or
               5 - show the first line of all levels of CUT in the user
                   profile POOL.

  Command syntax : CUT (default level is 1) or
  ---------------- CUT LN (level-number) or
                   CUT LN INSERT or
                   CUT LN DELETE or
                   CUT LN SHOW or
                   CUT SHOW or CUT SHOW TERSE
                   CUT HELP or H

  Use :  1 - write lines from a file to the user profile POOL for later
  -----      inclusion by the INSERT option.
             Syntax : CUT (default level is 1) or CUT LN (level-number)
             Restriction : the level-number may range between 1 and 99
                           included only.
             Enter CUT on the command line and use the C or M line
             commands (in any form) to select the lines to be cut.
             If the M line command is used, the indicated lines are
             deleted (reset to blanks) after they have been copied.
             A level-number may be used to separate different levels of
             CUT. This way you can make many CUTs before you INSERT.
             If the level-number is omited, level 1 is assumed and
             anything in the level 1 will be overlayed.
             CUT 3 (or any number) will CUT the indicated line(s) into
             level 3 (or level indicated) and can be INSERTed using
             the level-number.

                                                      CUT       2/3.

         2 - write lines from the user profile POOL into the current
             file (INSERT option).
             Syntax : CUT LN (level-number) INSERT or I
             Enter CUT on the command line followed by the level-number
             and the keyword INSERT, and use the A or B line command
             to specify where the lines are to be inserted.
             The level-number may be used to separate different levels
             of CUTs.
             CUT 3 (or any number) INSERT will add all the lines of the
             CUT level 3 (or level indicated) where the A or B line
             command (after or before) is pointing in the current file.

         3 - delete CUT data in the various levels of CUT in the user
             profile POOL.
             Syntax : CUT LN (level-number) DELETE or D
             Type CUT on the COMMAND line followed by the level-number
             and the keyword DELETE.
             In example :
               COMMAND ===> CUT 2 DELETE
               *********...********* TOP OF DATA *********...*********
               Result :
               COMMAND ===>                        CUT LEVEL 2 DELETED
               *********...********* TOP OF DATA *********...*********

         4 - show CUT data in the various levels of CUT in the user
             profile POOL.
             Syntax : CUT LN (level-number) SHOW or S
             Type CUT on the COMMAND line followed by the level-number
             and the keyword SHOW.
             In example :
               COMMAND ===> CUT 2 SHOW
               *********...********* TOP OF DATA *********...*********
               Result :
               ==MSG> CUT LEVEL 1 HAS 4 LINE(S)
               ==MSG> ... DATA LINE 1 ...
               ==MSG> ... DATA LINE 2 ...
               ==MSG> ... DATA LINE 3 ...
               ==MSG> ... DATA LINE 4 ...
             Remark : you may place the cursor on a data line to
                      indicate where the MSG lines must be inserted
                      (before), then press ENTER (by default it is
                      before data line 1).

                                                      CUT       3/3.

         5 - show the first line of all levels of CUT in the user
             profile POOL. An optional keyword TERSE will prevent
             display for CUT levels with no lines.
             Syntax : CUT SHOW or CUT SHOW TERSE (CUT S or CUT S T)
             Type CUT on the COMMAND line followed by the keyword SHOW
             and the optional TERSE keyword.
             In example :
               COMMAND ===> CUT SHOW TERSE
               *********...********* TOP OF DATA *********...*********
               Result :
               ==MSG> FIRST LINE OF EACH LEVEL OF CUT WILL BE SHOWN
               ==MSG> CUT LEVEL 1 HAS 4 LINE(S)
               ==MSG> ... DATA LINE 1 ...
               ==MSG> CUT LEVEL 3 HAS 9 LINE(S)
               ==MSG> ... DATA LINE 1 ...
               ... and so on ...
               (the scan is done until level 99)
             Remark : you may place the cursor on a data line to
                      indicate where the MSG lines must be inserted
                      (before), then press ENTER (by default it is
                      before data line 1).
