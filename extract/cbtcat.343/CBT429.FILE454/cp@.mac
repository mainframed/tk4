  Purpose :    Solve a particular problem in running TSO under MVS
  ---------    under VM. Namely, when a terminal is dialed to a
               virtual machine, it can only be released by issuing
               a DETACH or RESET command from the VM console.
               If one console is being used for both roles, this
               poses a problem. The installation of this TSO command
               allows CP commands such as DETACH and RESET to be
               issued from a TSO console. The console can then
               release itself from TSO and be dialed in as the VM
               master console.

  Authority :  Only System Group USER-id's are authorized to issue
  -----------  this command.
