  Purpose : ISPCDSN will extract a data-set, pointed to by the cursor,
  --------- from an ISPF display panel. Data-set names are scanned for
         following standard naming and length conventions.

         The variable name to contain the data-set name must be passed
         to the program as a parameter, and will be placed into the
         SHARED variable pool if no errors are encountered. If errors
         are encountered, a return code reflecting the type of error
         will be returned following completion of the program.

         Return Codes :
               4 - Data-set name contains unmatched quotes
               8 - Data-set name missing between quotes
              12 - Cursor not on a data-set name
              16 - Data-set name larger than the 56 byte maximum
              20 - Control Block parameter error

         Example :
              ISPEXEC SELECT PGM(ISPCDSN) PARM(SOMEVAR)
              IF &LASTCC = 0 THEN ISPEXEC VGET (SOMEVAR) SHARED
