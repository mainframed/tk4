  Assembler macro : $XRET CC=,TYPE=,LV=,SP=
  -----------------

      1. TYPE=NORENT (not reenterable)

         - restore register 13 with the previous save area address.
         - set a return code in the register 15 (CC operand).
         - restore all the other registers from the previous
           save area.
         - flag the save area used by the returning program.
         - return control to the calling program (register 14).

      2. TYPE=RENT (reenterable)

         - restore register 13 with the previous save area address.
         - release (FREEMAIN) an area of main storage (LV and SP
           operands) which is pointed to by register 13 (current
           save area address).
         - set a return code in the register 15 (CC operand).
         - restore all the other registers from the previous
           save area.
         - flag the save area used by the returning program.
         - return control to the calling program (register 14).

   TYPE operand - RENT or NORENT (default).

   CC operand - omitted : equivalent to CC=0 coding.
                CC=value : a number (from 0 to 4095).
                CC=symbol : a symbol (value must range from 0 to 4095).
                CC=(register) : value previously loaded into a
                                register (0 to 4095). Do not specify
                                register 13 when NORENT type, and
                                register 0, 1, 13, 14 or 15 when RENT
                                type.

   LV operand - is the length of the main storage area to be released
                (LV operand of the FREEMAIN R-type macro). Default
                value is 72 (18*4 is equal to a save area).

   SP operand - is the subpool number of the main storage to be
                freed (SP operand of the FREEMAIN R-type macro).
                Default value is 0 (zero).
