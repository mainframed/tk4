  Assembler macro : $XENT BASE=,ID=,DT=,TYPE=,LV=,SP=
  ----------------- $XENT B1=,B2=,ID=,DT=,TYPE=,LV=,SP=  (old version)

      1. TYPE=NORENT (not reenterable)

         - store the registers in the caller's save area (register 13).
         - set one or more base registers (BASE or B1 and B2 operands).
         - generate the identifier name.
         - generate the assembly date and time (DT operand).
         - link a new save area (new register 13), which is
           located at the entry point address + 32 (X'20').

      2. TYPE=RENT (reenterable)

         - store the registers in the caller's save area (register 13).
         - set one or more base registers (BASE or B1 and B2 operands).
         - generate the identifier name.
         - generate the assembly date and time (DT operand).
         - acquire (GETMAIN) main storage area (L and S operands into
           which is created, at the starting address, the new save
           area (new register 13).

   TYPE operand       - RENT or NORENT (default).

   BASE operand       - can be used to define the desired base
                        registers (default values are 11 and 12).
                        more registers values separated by commas
                        and enclosed within parentheses may be
                        specified. The first base register points
                        to the entry address, and the successives
                        are incremented by a displacement of +4096.
                        This operand supersedes B1 and B2 operands.
                        Do not specify register 0, 1, 13, 14 or 15
                        to any value of this operand.

   B1 and B2 operands - these operands are superseded by the BASE
                        operand. They are maintained for old
                        source compatibility only.
                        Can be used to define the desired base
                        registers (default values are 11 and 12,
                        which respectively point to the entry
                        address and the entry address + 4096).
                        Do not specify register 0, 1, 13, 14 or 15
                        to any one of these operands.

   ID operand         - identifier name (8 characters length maximum).
                        If omitted, the label name is used if supplied,
                        or the current control section name.

   DT operand         - can be used to suppress the assembly date and
                        time generation (i.e. - DT=NO).

   LV operand         - is the length of the main storage area to be
                        acquired (LV operand of the GETMAIN R-type
                        macro). Default value is 72 (18*4 is equal
                        to a save area).

   SP operand         - Is the subpool number of the main storage to
                        be allocated (SP operand of the GETMAIN R-type
                        macro). Default value is 0 (zero).
