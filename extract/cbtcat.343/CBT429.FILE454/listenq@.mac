   Function :  The LISTENQ command returns information reguarding
   ----------  allocations for a JOB or USERID. It tells you what
               data-set(s) the job has allocated, and how it is
               allocated (OLD or SHR). It will also tell what
               data-sets the job or user may be waiting on.
          Outputs :
               XYZ.ABC.DEF               ALLOCATED SHR
                    means the job scanned has XYZ.ZBC.DEF SHR.
               ABC.DEF.GHI               ALLOCATED OLD
                    means the job scanned has ABC.DEF.GHI OLD.
               ABC.TRS.XYZ               WAITING   SHR.
                    means the job scanned wants data-set ABC.TRS.XYZ
                    allocated share, but the data-set is currently
                    allocated OLD to another job.
          Return codes :
                0 - indicates job or user found in execution.
                    All conflicts (if any) have been listed.
                4 - indicates job or user not found in execution.
