  Calling sequence : CALL EDITH,(A,B,C,D),VL
  ------------------            (A,B,C)
                                (A,B)
                                (A)

         Where : A - is the address of the text to be expanded and
                     blocks printed by group of 16 characters (if the
                     last group is less than 16, it is centered).
                     The block characters are printed using 8 lines
                     (length 132), preceeded and followed by a blank
                     line. Unknown characters are left blank.

                 B - is the address of text length (no. of characters :
                     format FULLWORD - F boundary). When this argument
                     is omitted, or the address of this argument is
                     set to zero in the parameters list, the length of
                     the text is supposed to be in front of the text,
                     at the address of A-1 (format XL1).

                 C - is the address of the DD-name (format CL8) if
                     supplied (optional). When this argument is
                     omitted, or the address of this argument is set
                     to zero in the parameters list, the default
                     DD-name used is SYSPRINT.

                 D - is the address of the indicator response (format
                     FULLWORD - F boundary) if supplied (optional).
                     Value is always placed in register 15 and can be :

                      0 - PRINT correctly executed.
                      1 - DD-card missing.
                      2 - OPEN error.
                      3 - Calling sequence or argument alignment error.
                      4 - Length is negative, zero or greater than the
                          logical record length (maximum allowable is
                          145). The line is printed, but truncated.
                      5 - PRINT error.


  Assembler macro : $EDITH A,B,C,D

         Where B, C and/or D are optional and may be omitted.
         Register use may be coded within parentheses.

                                                      EDITH     2/2.


  General notice : this subroutine uses the PRINT subroutine, and
  ---------------- thus it is necessary to CALL PCLOSE in order to
                   terminate the header edit files.
                   This routine is multi-files usable, that means
                   multi-files opened concurrently (using the DD-name
                   argument).

  Example :   coding in a program :
  ---------
                   ... ... ...
                           $EDITH HT
                   ... ... ...
                           DC     AL1(L'HT)
                   HT      DC     C'ABC'
                   ... ... ...

              result on SYSPRINT file :

              Line  1 :
              Line  2 :        *    ******   ******
              Line  3 :       ***   **   ** **
              Line  4 :      ** **  **   ** **
              Line  5 :     **   ** ******  **
              Line  6 :     **   ** **   ** **
              Line  7 :     ******* **   ** **
              Line  8 :     **   ** **   ** **
              Line  9 :     **   ** ******   ******
              Line 10 :
