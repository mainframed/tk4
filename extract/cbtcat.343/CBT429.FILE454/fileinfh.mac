)F FUNCTION :  the FILEINFO command is intended for use in command
               procedures. This command returns to the CLIST (thru
               CLIST variables) information about that file such as
               LRECL, BLKSIZE, RECFM, DSORG, volume serial number,
               device type, number of used tracks and extents.
               After execution of this command, the following CLIST
               variables are set. Their names and contents are as
               follows :
  CLIST Var.   Contents
  ----------   ------------------------------------------------------
  &FULLDSN     Your data-set name as follows :
               a. PROFILE PREFIX added if data-set name in DSN
                  keyword was not quoted.
               b. Quotes now stripped off.
               c. Member name included, if and only if, member name
                  was provided in the DSN keyword, otherwise &FULLDSN
                  will not include this member name.
  &LRECL       Logical record length of data-set.
  &BLKSIZE     Blocksize of data-set.
  &RECFM       Will contain one of the following three values :

                 'U' for undefined records.
  &CNTLCHAR    Will contain one of the following three values :

  &VOLSER      Volume serial number where data-set resides.
  &DSORG       Will contain one of the following values :

                 'DA' for direct organization,
                 'CX' for BTAM or QTAM line group,
                 'PO' for partitioned,
                 'U ' for unmovable (the data contains location
                                     dependent information),
                 'VS' for VSAM data-set.
  &ISITCAT     Will contain one of the following three values :
                 'YES' if data-set is cataloged,
                 'NO ' if data-set is not cataloged,
                 '   ' if n/a (higher level error was detected prior
                               to LOCATE).
  &MEMFND      Will contain one of the following three values :
                 'YES' if member of PDS was found,
                 'NO ' if member of PDS was not found,
                 '   ' if n/a (user didn't request this command to
                               locate a member)
  &MEMCNTL     Will contain one of the following two values :
                 'YES' if member name was included with the data-set
                       name in the DSN keyword
                 'NO ' if member name was not included with the
                       data-set name in the DSN keyword
  &EXTENTNO    Number of used extents. This field is significant
               only for disk sequential and partitioned data-sets.
  &TRKSUSED    Number of used tracks. This field is significant
               only for disk sequential and partitioned data-sets.
  This command will also make available two other variables that the
  invoking CLIST may interrogate. Below is a table of values after
  execution of this command for these two variables &OUTMSG and
  &LASTCC (return code) :
       &LASTCC   &OUTMSG
          0      Successful completion
          4      Data-set not cataloged

         96      Invalid syntax of operand(s)
  Remark : if this command is invoked outside a CLIST, the contents of
  -------- all variables are displayed to the terminal, and no CLIST
           variables are set.

))DSN('dataset name') : 'dataset name' is the data-set name of the
               data-set that you wish to receive file information
               about. If the data-set name is not quoted, then the
               PROFILE PREFIX will be appended. You may provide a
               member name of a PDS if you wish. This command will
               return in CLIST variable MEMFND 'YES' if the member is
               found in the directory and 'NO' if it is not found in
               the directory.

))VOL('vol ser') : 'vol ser' is to be used if your file is not
               cataloged.
               Aliases : VOLUME, VOLSER or V.
))MEM('member name') : 'member name' is the member name of the PDS
               named by 'dataset name'. This command will return in
               CLIST variable MEMFND 'YES' if the member is found
               in the directory and 'NO' if it is not found in the
               directory.
