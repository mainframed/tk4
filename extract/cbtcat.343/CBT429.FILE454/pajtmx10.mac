%Encryption-Decryption of "mail-box" entries data.+

 When creating or updating "mail-box" entries (MAILBOX and "M" commands)
 may encrypt the data (see edit macro "ENCRYPT") before they are stored
 edit). Then, these "mail-box" entries data which have been encrypted at
 time they have been created or updated, must be decrypted before any br
 or print operation ("B" or "L" commands) may be executed. To do it, you
 also set the data decryption request (on the MAIL-LIST panel) to :
   %YES+if you have entirely encrypted the text, and you will be prompte
      supply your secret key-value(s) for data decryption until you ente
      null key-value to signal the end of decryption is reached for the
      "mail-box" entry (entering a null key-value the first time you are
      prompted is equivalent to say no data decryption),
 or%RANGE+if you have only partially encrypted the text, and you will be
      in Edit mode on the "mail-box" entry in order to decrypt yourself
      "mail-box" entry text (macro "DECRYPT"), then END the Edit session
