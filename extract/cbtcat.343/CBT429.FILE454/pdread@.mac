  Calling sequence : CALL PDREAD,(A,B,C),VL
  ------------------             (A,B)
                                 (A)

         Where : A - is the address of an array (format XL74) into
                     which the next sequential directory entry of a
                     partitioned data-set is moved.

                 B - is the address of the DD-name (format CL8) if
                     supplied (optional). When this argument is
                     omitted, or the address of this argument is set
                     to zero in the parameters list, the default
                     DD-name used is SYSDIR.

                 C - is the address of the indicator response (format
                     FULLWORD - F boundary) if supplied (optional).
                     Value is always placed in register 15 and can be :

                     -1 - directory reaches END-OF-FILE.
                      0 - READ correctly executed.
                      1 - file not opened.
                      2 - calling sequence or argument alignment error.
                      3 - READ error.

         Where B and/or C are optional and may be omitted.
         Register use may be coded within parentheses.

  Calling sequence : CALL PDOPEN,(A,B,C),VL
  ------------------             (A,B)
                                 (A)

         Where : A - is the address of a response field (format CL50)
                     if supplied (optional). The information returned
                     back to the caller are the data-set name (CL44)
                     followed by the volume serial number (CL6).

                 B - is the address of the DD-name (format CL8) if
                     supplied (optional). When this argument is
                     omitted, or the address of this argument is set
                     to zero in the parameters list, the default
                     DD-name used is SYSDIR.

                 C - is the address of the indicator response (format
                     FULLWORD - F boundary) if supplied (optional).
                     Value is always placed in register 15 and can be :

                      0 - OPEN correctly executed.
                      1 - DD-card missing.
                      2 - OPEN error or DD-card conflict.
                      3 - calling sequence or argument alignment error.
                      4 - file already opened.
                      5 - file RDJFCB error.
                      6 - file OBTAIN error.
                      7 - not partitioned data-set.

  Assembler macro : $PDOPEN A,B,C
  -----------------

         Where A, B and/or C are optional and may be omitted.
         Register use may be coded within parentheses.

  Calling sequence : CALL PDCLOSE,(A,B),VL
  ------------------              (A)

         Where : A - is the address of the DD-name (format CL8) to
                     close. If this argument contains the CLOSEALL
                     keyword, or the address of this argument is set
                     to zero in the parameters list, or the parameters
                     list pointer (register 1) is zero, all the opened
                     files are closed.

                 B - is the address of the indicator response (format
                     FULLWORD - F boundary) if supplied (optional).
                     Value is always placed in register 15 and can be :

                      0 - CLOSE correctly executed.
                      1 - calling sequence, argument alignment or
                          DD-name error.

  Assembler macro : $PDCLOSE A,B
  -----------------

         Where A and or B are optional and may be omitted.
         Register use may be coded within parentheses.

  General notice : On any error detection, a message is included in
  ================ the message class for the job.
                   If the routine is re-called after IND = 1 or 2,
                   the program is sended in abend U0001.
                   If the indicator response is detected 10 times
                   different from 0, the program is sended in
                   abend U0002.
                   This routine is multi-files usable, that means
                   multi-files opened concurrently (using the DD-name
                   argument).
