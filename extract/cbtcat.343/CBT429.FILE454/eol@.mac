  Function :   This Edit macro may be used to position the cursor at
  ----------   the end ofthe current screen line (like most PC editors
               do when you press the "End" scroll key). Yes, it takes
               some interrupts and a PF key definition, but that is the
               price you have to pay for PC-like features on a 3270.
               By pressing the EOL PF key repeatedly, you can jump to
               end of line (EOL) on successive lines.
               Note : This can not jump over more than 1 excluded line.

  Use :        Assume cursor was on word IN on line 000020 and press
  -----        the appropriate PF key (the one assigned to EOL).
