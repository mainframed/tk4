  Calling sequence : CALL VREAD,(A,B,C),VL
  ------------------            (A,B)
                                (A)

         Where : A - is the address of an array (format CL...) into
                     which the logical record is read.

                 B - is the address of the DD-name (format CL8) if
                     supplied (optional). When this argument is
                     omitted, or the address of this argument is set
                     to zero in the parameters list, the default
                     DD-name used is SYSVRIN.

                 C - is the address of the indicator response (format
                     FULLWORD - F boundary) if supplied (optional).
                     Value is always placed in register 15 and can be :

                     -1 - END-OF-FILE.
                      0 - READ correctly executed.
                      1 - file not opened.
                      2 - calling sequence or argument alignment error.
                      3 - READ error.

         Where B and/or C are optional and may be omitted.
         Register use may be coded within parentheses.

  Calling sequence : CALL VOPEN,(A,B,C),VL
  ------------------            (A,B)
                                (A)

         Where : A - receives the maximum logical record length (format
                     FULLWORD - F boundary) for the file. This argument
                     is mandatory because information is returned to
                     the caller.

                 B - is the address od the DD-name (format CL8) if
                     supplied (optional). When this argument is
                     omitted, or the address of this argument is set
                     to zero in the parameters list, the default
                     DD-name used is SYSVRIN.

                 C - is the address of the indicator response (format
                     FULLWORD - F boundary) if supplied (optional).
                     Value is always placed in register 15 and can be :

                      0 - OPEN correctly executed.
                      1 - DD-card missing.
                      2 - OPEN error, record format not defined or
                          LRECL too large (maximum allowed is 256).
                      3 - calling sequence or argument alignment error.
                      4 - file already opened.

  Assembler macro : $VOPEN A,B,C

         Where B and/or C are optional and may be omitted.
         Register use may be coded within parentheses.

  Callins sequence : CALL VCLOSE,(A,B),VL
  ------------------             (A)

         Where : A - is the address of the DD-name (format CL8) to
                     close. If this argument contains the CLOSEALL
                     keyword, or the address of this arguemnt is ser
                     to zero in the parameters list, or the parameters
                     list pointed (register 1) is zero, all the opened
                     files are closed.

                 B - is the address of the indicator response (format
                     FULLWORD - F boundary) if supplied (optional).
                     Value is always placed in register 15 and can be :

                      0 - CLOSE correctly executed.
                      1 - calling sequence, argument alignment or
                          DD-name error.

  Assembler macro : $VCLOSE A,B
  -----------------

         Where A and/or B are optional and may be omitted.
         Register use may be coded within parentheses.


  General notice : on any error detection, a message is included in
  ================ the message class for the job.
                   If the routine is re-called after IND = 1 or 2,
                   the program is sended in abend U0001.
                   If the indicator response is detected 10 times
                   different from 0, the program is sended in
                   abend U0002.
                   This routine is multi-files usable, that means
                   multi-files opened concurrently (using the DD-name
                   argument).
