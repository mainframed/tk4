  Calling sequence : CALL SNAP,(A,B,C,D),VL
  ------------------           (A,B,C)
                               (A,B)

         Where : A - is the address of the storage area to be dumped.
                     The area will be printed hexadecimal and EBCDIC
                     image.

                 B - is the address of the length (no. of characters)
                     of the storage area to be dumped (format FULLWORD
                     - F boundary).

                 C - is the address of the DD-name (format CL8) if
                     supplied (optional). When this argument is
                     omitted, or the address of this argument is set
                     to zero in the parameters list, the default
                     DD-name used is SYSPRINT.

                 D - is the address of the indicator response (format
                     FULLWORD - F boundary) if supplied (optional).
                     Value is always placed in register 15 and can be :

                      0 - PRINT correctly executed.
                      1 - DD-card missing.
                      2 - OPEN error.
                      3 - calling sequence or argument alignment error.
                      4 - length is negative, zero or greater than the
                          logical record length (maximum allowable is
                          145). The line is printed, but truncated.
                      5 - PRINT error.

  Assembler macro : $SNAP A,B,C,D
  -----------------

         Where C and/or D are optional and may be omitted.
         Register use may be coded within parentheses.

                                                      SNAP      2/2.

  General notice : this subroutine uses the PRINT subroutine, and
  ================ thus it is necessary to CALL PCLOSE in order to
                   terminate the snap file.
                   This routine is multi-files usable, that means
                   multi-files opened concurrently (using the DD-name
                   argument).

  How to suppress lines with same data (reduce output print).
  -----------------------------------------------------------

         Every times before entering the SNAP routine for an array
  dump, execute the following two instructions :
                   ...
                   L     Rx,=V(#SNSW#)
                   MVI   0(Rx),1
                   ...
