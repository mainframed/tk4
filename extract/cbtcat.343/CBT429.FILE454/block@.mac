  Function :   This Edit macro may be used to create multiple block
  ----------   characters in your text (Super-Type Text macro).

  Syntax :     BLOCK T=string of characters to generate after pointed
  --------     line.
               Warning : If the string of characters must contain any
                         command delimiter character (special character
                         for command stacking, see ISPF option 0.1),
                         you must use the next way of entering the
                         command, otherwise the string will be truncated
                         at first encountered delimiter character, and
                         the rest will be handled as another command,
                         which probably would be invalid.
               BLOCK or BLOCK T= and string of characters to generate
                                     read from pointed line
               BLOCK HELP or H

  Use :        Type BLOCK on the command line followed by T= string of
  -----        characters that you wish to have in block letters in
               your text. Then place the cursor on the line where you
               want the text is to be inserted. The block characters
               text will be created starting at line after where the
               cursor is (if it is not within a data line, the first
               line is assumed as cursor position). An attempt will
               be made to center the text if only one line of block
               characters is created. If more than one block-line
               (requires five data lines) is needed, the starting
               characters (including spaces) will be on the first
               indicated block-line, a line is skipped and the next
               group is created. If more than two block-lines are
               needed, the next are created after skipping another
               line, and so on.
               Warning : Remember no command delimiter character in
                         the string.

                                                      BLOCK     1/2.

   Example : COMMAND ===> BLOCK T=HI THERE
   ****** ***************************** TOP OF DATA *****************...
   000100 ...
   000200 ...
   Result :
   ****** ***************************** TOP OF DATA *****************...
   000100 ...
   000110
   000120             H   H  III        TTTTT H   H EEEEE RRRR  EEEEE
   000130             H   H   I           T   H   H E     R   R E

               To enter a string of characters containing any command
               delimiter character(s) or to type very long strings, as
               many as you can get on a line of data, enter the string
               of characters on a data line within the text. Type BLOCK
               on the command line, move the cursor to the line with
               the string typed on it, and press enter. The entire line
               pointed by the cursor will be read, all leading blanks
               eliminated, and then used as string of characters.
               Spacing is up to you, thus you must plan your text so
               that it appears the way you want it. The line with the
               string of characters text is preserved.

   Example : COMMAND ===> BLOCK
   002000 ...
   002100 ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ0123456789
   002200 ...     (The cursor can be placed anywhere on the line above)
