 %LC      +change paragraph to Lower Case
           LC causes UPPER CASE text in the box defined by OL, OR, and t
           line commands to be transformed to lower case letters.
           Start of sentence words will still be capitalized.
           Why have this routine ? Two reasons :
            (1) Suppose under TE (text entry) you typed a lot of upper a
                case text while editing a data-set which had CAPS ON. Th
                would be converted entirely to UPPER CASE. It is faster
                change the entire text to lower case and recapitalize wh
                required than to retype the entire text.
            (2) Suppose you are modifying old text, all of which is in c
                You want your revised text in both upper and lower case.
                faster to change the entire text to lower case and recap
                where required than to retype the entire text.
