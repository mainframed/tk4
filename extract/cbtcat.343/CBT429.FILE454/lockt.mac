* How to define the keywords user mask :                              *
* ======================================                              *
*        1. Anywhere you desire, between the lines labeled "UKSCT"    *
*           and "UKSCTEND", so in the users keywords table, insert    *
*           a line starting with an asterisk (comment line) in column *
*           1 followed by the USER-ID and his TWO SECRET KEYS you     *
*           want define (each separated from the other by at least a  *
*           blank). I.e., assuming a USER-ID name "ZULU" and the TWO  *
*           SECRET KEYWORDS "ALPHA" and "BETA" (which must be given   *
*           in the same order to UNLOCK terminal), insert the line :  *
*                         *    ZULU  ALPHA  BETA                      *
*        2. Then type KUMX (this is an ISPF Edit macro name) in the   *
*           COMMAND line, place the CURSOR somewhere on the previous  *
*           inserted line, and push ENTER.                            *
*           This function insert just after the line you have pointed *
*           the needed masked constant.                               *
*        3. Finally, delete the inserted comment line with USER-ID    *
*           and his SECRET KEYS.                                      *
*        Repeat these steps for all USER-ID's and couple of KEYS you  *
*        have to define.                                              *
