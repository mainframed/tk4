  Calling sequence : CALL SETOPC,(A,B),VL
  ------------------             (A)

         Where : A - is the address of the block informal text to
                     be displayed at the system master console for
                     operator SETUP (optional). When this argument
                     is omitted, or the address of this argument is
                     set to zero in the parameters list, or the
                     parameters list pointer (register 1) is zero,
                     the default request is assumed to be the use
                     of the Operating System STOP (P) command only.
                     Block informal text (the maximum text length
                     allowed is 72 characters by message, if more,
                     it is truncated) format :

                              DC    AL1(L'TEXT1)
                     TEXT1    DC    C'...MESSAGE 1...'
                              DC    AL1(L'TEXT2)
                     TEXT2    DC    C'...MESSAGE 2...'
                     ... ... ...
                              DC    AL1(L'TEXTN)
                     TEXTN    DC    C'...MESSAGE n...'
                              DC    AL1(0) or AL1(225) : end of list.

                 B - is the address of the indicator response (format
                     FULLWORD - F boundary) if supplied (optional).
                     Value is always placed in register 15 and can be :

                      0 - operator communication is ready.
                          The register 1 contains the address of the
                          message-id's numbers list for delete use when
                          the calling program does not terminate by the
                          STOP or MODIFY (like STOP) operator command,
                          and the register 0 contains the length of the
                          GETMAINed area into which the list has been
                          builded (for FREEMAIN purpose).
                      1 - calling sequence or argument alignment error.

         Alias : CALL INIFIN

         Where A and/or B are optional and may be omitted.
         Register use may be coded within parentheses.

  Calling sequence : CALL OPCOM,(A,B),VL
  ------------------            (A)

         Where : A - is the address of the response indicator (format
                     FULLWORD - F boundary). When the address of this
                     argument is set to zero in the parameters list,
                     or the parameters list pointer (register 1) is
                     zero, the value is always placed in register 15
                     and can be :

                      1 - continue processing (nothing received from
                          the operator).
                      2 - STOP (P) command received.
                      3 - MODIFY (F) command received.
                      4 - calling sequence, argument alignment or
                          operator communication not initialized.

                 B - is the address of an array (optional) large enough
                     (otherwise truncated) to receive the eventual
                     MODIFY command text typed by the operator. When
                     this argument is omitted, the MODIFY command text
                     is not available to the caller and the response
                     indicator is set to 2 (as STOP command received).
                     Before any CALL, this receiving text array must be
                     initialized as below :

                      +0 - length of text receiving field (format H -
                           halfword boundary).
                      +2 - text receiving field (format CL...).

                     The text entered by the MODIFY command is placed
                     in the array as follows :

                      +0 - length of text (format H).
                      +2 - text (format CL..., text is uppercased).
