  Purpose :    Routine to read sequentially an entire VTOC.
  ---------    A DD-card, written as below, is needed to define
               the desired volume :

               //...     DD  UNIT=...,VOLUME=SER=...,DISP=OLD


  Calling sequence : CALL VTOCSR,(A,B,C),VL
  ------------------             (A,B)
                                 (A)

         Where : A - is the address of an array (format FULLWORD -
                     F boundary) which receives the DSCB's record
                     (140 bytes long).

                 B - is the address of the current DSCB's record
                     address, in the format MBBCCHHR (format XL8),
                     returned after each read operation, unless when
                     the END-OF-FILE is detected or a pseudo format 5
                     DSCB is passed back by the indexed VTOC interface
                     routine (IXTOFMT5) if it has been generated (the
                     MBBCCHHR is set to all x'FF'. This argument is
                     optional and may be omitted or his address may be
                     set to zero in the parameters list.

                 C - is the address of the indicator response (format
                     FULLWORD - F boundary) if supplied (optional).
                     Value is always placed in register 15 and can be :

                     -1 - END-OF-FILE detected. When an indexed VTOC is
                          processed, at END-OF-FILE return, the register
                          0 points to two fullwords which are containing
                          the counts of the free (FMT 0) DSCBs and the
                          free VIRS respectively.
                          With normal VTOC, register 0 is set to zero.
                      0 - READ operation correctly executed.
                      1 - READ error.
                      2 - file not opened.
                      3 - calling sequence or argument alignment error.
                     NN - indexed VTOC interface routine return code
                          (if it has been requested at the assembly),
                          with R0 = error information (IXTOFMT5).

  ------------------             (A,B)
                                 (A)

         Where : A - is the address of the DD-name (format CL8).

                 B - is the address of the device characteristics
                     (format FULLWORD - F boundary) returned by the
                     routine if supplied (optional). It will receive
                     five fullwords information as described in DEVTYPE
                     macro (see OS/VS2 System Programming Library :
                     Data Management), followed by one halfword
                     containing the number of alternate tracks for
                     the device, followed by a six characters field
                     containing the volume serial number of the
                     device. This argument is optional and may be
                     omitted or his address may be set to zero in the
                     parameters list.

                 C - is the address of the indicator response (format
                     FULLWORD - F boundary) if supplied (optional).
                     Value is always placed in register 15 and can be :

                      0 - OPEN correctly executed.
                      1 - file already opened.
                      2 - OPEN error.
                      3 - calling sequence or argument alignment error.
                      4 - not OS/VS2 System.
                      5 - DD-card missing.
                      6 - not direct-access storage device.
                      7 - read JFCB error.
                      8 - DD-card incorrectly coded.

                     list pointer - register 1). Value is always placed

  General notice : on error reading a VTOC's DSCB a message is included
  ---------------- in the message class for the job.
                   This routine is only serially volumes usable.
