  Calling sequence : CALL RTIME,(A,B),VL
  ------------------            (A)

         Where : A and optionally B are the addresses of fullwords
                 (F boundary) receiving respectively the JOB or STEP
                 remaining CPU time in seconds and the JOB remaining
                 number of I/O in thousands (SRB time in seconds),
                 floating point single precision expressed.

         Note :  the CPU time is that remaining for the STEP if the
                 'TIME=...' keyword has been coded on the EXEC
                 statement of this step, otherwise it is the JOB
                 remaining CPU time.

  How to use :
  ------------

         If A and B arguments are supplied, you receive the CPU time
               in A (1 day = 86400 secs) and the number of I/O in B.
               If no CPU timing, CPU time left = 1000000 secs.
               If no I/O control, I/O number left = 2000000 thds.

         If A argument only, you get remaining CPU time + I/O number.
         In this situation, from the resulting sum you can determine
         if there is CPU timing or I/O control as below :
               3,0 million = no CPU timing, no I/O control.
               2,X million = yes CPU timing, no I/O control.
               1,X million = no CPU timing, yes I/O control.
               0,X million = yes CPU timing, yes I/O control, you have
                             the sum.
