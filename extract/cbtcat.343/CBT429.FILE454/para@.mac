  Function :   This Edit macro is an improved TFLOW, a paragraph
  ----------   reformatter.

  Command syntax : PARA ...keyword(s)...
  ----------------      (if no keywords specified then prompting)
                   PARA HELP or H
                   Use "C" range block commands to define start and
                   end of paragraph.

  New facility : code PARA on the command line and use "C" range
  ============== line command(s) only, you will be prompted for all
                 parameters through a panel.

  PARA's keyword parameters :
  ---------------------------
                I=nn : define paragraph's first line indentation
               OL=nn : define old left margin
               OR=nn : define old right margin
               NL=nn : define new left margin
               NR=nn : define new right margin
                   D : double space at end of sentence
                  ND : none (single space)
                   J : right margin justification
                  NJ : no justification
                   C : means centering of paragraph
                  NC : no centering

                  LC : change paragraph to lower case
                SHAR : store parameters in SHARED pool (alias : S)
                PROF : store parameters in your PROFILE (alias : P)
                   ? : query current parameters values
                HELP : display documentation (alias : H)

                                                      PARA     2/6.

 Text processing on TSO has made strides with the introduction of :

             PPPPPPPPPPP     AAAAA      RRRRRRRRRRR      AAAAA
            PP        PP   AA   AA     RR        RR    AA   AA
           PPPPPPPPPPP   AA     AA    RRRRRRRRRRR    AA     AA
          PP           AAAAAAAAAAA   RR       RR   AAAAAAAAAAA
         PP           AA        AA  RR        RR  AA        AA

 PARA reformats paragraphs more easily. Now you can type a memo using
 TE (Text Enter), and rework it, adding lines, blanking or deleting
 words and phrases, then reformat your paragraphs easily.
 I can hear some questions in your mind :

 What do you mean by reformat ?
 PARA can change left and right margins, first line indentation, move
 words from line to line to adjust line length, justify the left
 margin, optionally justify the right margin, and double or single
 space after end of sentences.

    It means that     It means that you  can  create paragraphs side by
    you       can     side.  These paragraphs are examples.
    easily create
    very,   very,        It means that you can indent paragraphs to the
    very,   very,     right; this paragraph is an example.
    tall, skinny,
    slender,          It means that  you  can  indent paragraphs to the
    willowy,             left.  This paragraph is an example.
    lean,  narrow
    paragraphs        You do not have to right justify paragraphs. Or
    like     this     indent the first line. Or double space after the
    one.              end of a sentence. This is an example.

                              With   some
                            ingenuity,  you
                          can          create
                        paragraphs    in   many
                      different styles.   You can
                    create  impact  by  the  visual
                  appearance  of  your  writing,  and
                make your  letters  and  memoranda more
                effective.  True, visual appearance can
                  never replace the lasting impact of
                    content,  but  it  can increase
                      the attention people pay to
                        your   letters.   After
                          all,   didn't   you
                            read this  far?

              You can  even  center  paragraphs after you
              have   reformatted    them.     Like   this
                        paragraph, for example.

                                                      PARA     3/6.

 B               You can reformat   paragraphs
 E    that look like this              paragraph with one command.
 F    This paragraph looks
 O       like some paragraphs I have created when I
 R      was just putting my thoughts down, then went back over the
 E   paragraph and cleaned it up.

 A     You can reformat paragraphs  that  look like this paragraph with
 F  one command.  This  paragraph  looks  like  some  paragraphs I have
 T  created when I was just  putting  my  thoughts down, then went back
 E  over the paragraph and cleaned it up.  SEE!
 R

 What do you mean by easily ?
 You tell PARA what to do by coding PARA on the command line followed
 by keyword=value or keyword combinations, then use "C" range line
 commands to mark the start and end of the paragraph :
      COMMAND ===> PARA NL=6 NR=72 I=3 J D
 ---> CC 068              You can reformat   paragraphs
      000069   that look like this              paragraph with one
      000070   command.        This paragraph looks
      000071      like some paragraphs I have created when I
      000072     was just putting my thoughts down, then went back
      000073  over  the  paragraph and cleaned it up.
 ---> CC 074        SEE!
 PARA will remember these combinations during the ISPF session, so you
 only have to code any changes the next time you execute PARA.
      COMMAND ===> PARA I=0
 ---> CC 081     You tell PARA what to do by coding PARA
      000082        on the command line
 ---> CC 083  followed by keyword=value or keyword combinations,

 What if I forget these combinations ?
 You can ask PARA to tell you its current combinations, without doing
 any paragraph reformatting. Example :
      COMMAND ===> PARA ?
      000081     You tell PARA what to do by coding PARA
 At this point, a panel is displayed with the current PARA parameters
 values.

 What are all these PARA parameters ?
 A PARA parameters reference appendix follows.

                                                      PARA     4/6.

     ------  Edit Macro PARA Parameters Reference Appendix  ------

 1. Parameters that PARA remembers during an ISPF session :

  OL=nn    Old Left side of the paragraph
  OR=nn    Old Right side of the paragraph
           The Old parameters tell PARA where to find the paragraph to
           be reformatted. The first time PARA executes during an ISPF
           session, the Old parameters normally default to the display
           columns on the left and right sides of the screen. You will
           only change the Old parameters when :
            (1) You are editing a document wider than the screen size
                (i.e., 133 wide for a 3278 model 2, 80 columns wide).
            (2) Or, when there is textual material that you don't want
                to include on the left or right side of the paragraph
                to be reformatted.
           Example :
           COMMAND ===>
           =COLS> ----+----1----+----2----+----3----+----4----+--
           000003 //*  THIS IS A DEMAND DEPOSIT JOB.            *
           000004 //*    IT RUNS WEEKLY, EVERY MONDAY, ROLLING  *
           000005 //* FORWARD IF MONDAY IS A HOLIDAY.           *
           In this example, you don't want the //* and the * to be
           included in your new paragraph, so you code :
           COMMAND ===> PARA OL=4 OR=46 NL=4 NR=45
           =COLS> ----+----1----+----2----+----3----+----4----+--
      ---> CC 003 //*  THIS IS A DEMAND DEPOSIT JOB.            *
           000004 //*    IT RUNS WEEKLY, EVERY MONDAY, ROLLING  *
      ---> CC 005 //* FORWARD IF MONDAY IS A HOLIDAY.           *
           to exclude them from the reformatted paragraph. Don't forget
           to change them back if you switch from JCL to a memorandum.


  NL=nn    New Left side of the paragraph
  NR=nn    New Right side of the paragraph
           The New parameters tell PARA where to put the reformatted
           paragraph.
           The New parameters are the most frequently coded parameters.

  I=nn     Indent the first line of the paragraph nn spaces (default
           is 0). The Indent parameter can be either zero (no
           indenting), positive (Indent nn spaces to the right), or
           negative (Indent no spaces to the left).

  J        right margin Justification (default)
  NJ       No right margin Justification
           If J is specified, PARA will insert the necessary number of
           spaces into each line of the paragraph to right align the
           right margin. The last line will not be justified.

                                                      PARA     5/6.

  D        Double space after end of sentence (default)
  ND       No Double space after end of sentence
           By default, the following characters are recognized as end
           of sentence :
           . . . end of sentence . (may be changed through
           . . . end of sentence !    the prompting panel)
           . . . end of sentence ? Note : these characters must never
           . . . end of sentence :        have an hexadecimal value
           . . . end of sentence "        greater than X'7F')

 2. Parameters that PARA will not remember (one time only) :

  PROF     store PARA parameters in your PROFile data-set
  SHAR     store PARA parameters in the SHARed variable pool (default)
           If you want your PARA parameters to be remembered from
           session to session, specify PROF once only. From then on,
           PARA will store your PARA parameters in your PROFile
           data-set instead of in the SHARED variable pool.
           Specify SHAR if you change your mind.

  LC       change paragraph to Lower Case
           LC causes UPPER CASE text in the box defined by OL, OR,
           and the "C" range line commands to be transformed to
           lower case letters. Start of sentence words will still be
           capitalized. Why have this routine ? Two reasons :
            (1) Suppose under TE (text entry) you typed a lot of upper
                and lower case text while editing a data-set which had
                CAPS ON. The text would be converted entirely to UPPER
                CASE. It is faster to change the entire text to lower
                case and recapitalize where required than to retype
                the entire text.
            (2) Suppose you are modifying old text, all of which is in
                capitals. You want your revised text in both upper and
                lower case. It is faster to change the entire text to
                lower case and recapitalize where required than to
                retype the entire text.
1   12/08/91
                                                      PARA     6/6.

  RH       Remove Hyphens and reconnect words
           Remove Hyphens means if you have one word split across mul-
           tiple lines with a hyphen (like mul- tiple in this
           sentence), the hyphen (-) will be removed and the word
           will be reconnected into one word (i.e. multiple) before
           reformatting occurs.
           Why have this routine ? Two reasons :
            (1) Suppose you made an error previously when you executed
                PARA, making NL and NR too close together. If PARA
                finds a word that cannot fit between NL and NR, PARA
                splits the word into two or more pieces, hyphenating
                them. Many words might have been split into pieces.
                This routine makes recovery easy : just execute PARA
                with the correct NL/NR and RH.
            (2) Suppose you are modifying old text, with many words
                hyphenated. Your changes will shift the position of
                the hyphenated words within the paragraph, moving the
                hyphenated words to the middle of the line. This routine
                saves a lot of manual unhyphenation time.

  C        Center paragraph
  NC       No Centering of paragraph (default)
           Centering means center inside the OL/OR boundaries. This
           allows you to reformat a paragraph, view the results, then
           center the paragraph inside your document without figuring
           out any new parameters. Centering does not reformat, since
           the results after both reformatting and centering may be
           unexpected.

  ?        What are PARA's current parameters ?
           If ? is specified, a panel is displayed with the current
           values of the PARA parameters.

  HELP     display HELP information
           If HELP is specified, a panel is displayed which briefly
           explain the PARA parameters. Then follows full descriptions
           panels, if desired.
