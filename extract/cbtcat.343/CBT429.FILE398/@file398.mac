//***FILE 398 is from the contributor of File 171, which was        *
//*           contributed semi-anonymously.  All correspondence     *

//*           way.                                                  *
//*                                                                 *
//*           This file contains a macro called IBMMAC.  This       *
//*           macro calls other control block mapping macros,       *
//*           but you don't have to remember their names.           *
//*           That's the idea.                                      *
//*                                                                 *
//*           For example, if you want to map a VTOC DSCB, you      *
//*           don't have to remember that IBM's mapping macro       *
//*           name is IECSDSL1, and that you have to code a 1,      *
//*           2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 afterward, depending on the format   *
//*           type you want mapped.  With this macro, you only      *
//*           have to code:    IBMMAC VTOC=4 , or something         *
//*           similar, depending on the format type you want.       *
//*                                                                 *
//*           The original contributor's macro has been improved    *
//*           by Robert Rosenberg.  Bob Rosenberg's macro is now    *
//*           included here as member IBMMAC, and the original      *
//*           contributor's macro is also included, as member       *
//*           IBMMACO.                                              *
//*                                                                 *
//*           There are also two ISPF edit macros called IMAC       *
//*           and IMACBLD from Dave Alcock included here, which     *
//*           perform approximately the same function as the        *
//*           assembler macro IBMMAC--that is, they allow you to    *
//*           properly generate the coding of IBM macros,           *
//*           without your having to know all the particulars.      *
//*           IMACBLD uses the member HANDBOOK (from Gilbert        *
//*           Saint-flour) to generate IMAC, which is the edit      *
//*           macro that generates the IBM assembler macro coding.  *

//*           The author and I both request that others make an     *
//*           attempt to expand the IBMMAC macro to include a       *
//*           larger number of control blocks, and then send the    *
//*           result back to me, for inclusion in this file.        *
//*           Thanks in advance, from everybody, for your help.     *
