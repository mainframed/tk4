Sam,

We used to have a macro for assisting us with coding CICS macro level
programs.  It seems to me that a similar type macro could be useful
for programs that use a lot of system data areas.  I usually remembered
the data area name, but could not remember the macro (or copy) name.
This is a fairly short example.  Maybe you or someone else could take
this as a start made make a good macro out of it.

I called it IBM.  A better name may be DATAAREA.
