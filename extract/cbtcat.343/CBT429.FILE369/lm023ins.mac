                  NOTES ON INSTALL OF ZAP WITHOUT SMP

  0.  I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS METHOD OF INSTALLATION. (S.GOLOB)

  1.  EXPAND(128) IS A LINKAGE EDITOR OPTION WHICH IS HONORED BY
        SMP IN A ++ZAP REQUEST.  IF YOU WANT TO DO THIS WITHOUT
        SMP, A SAMPLE RELINK JOB LM023RLK IS INCLUDED.

  2.  THE ZAP MAY BE DONE TO THE OUTPUT MODULE OF THE RELINK JOB.

  3.  AFTER ZAP IS RUN, THE LOAD MODULE IEFW21SD MAY BE
        RELINKEDITED BY PULLING ITS LINKEDIT JCL OFF THE ASSEMBLY
        OF AN IOGEN.  YOU'LL NEED TO EXECUTE THE ASSEMBLY STEPS
        BEFORE, THAT ARE NEEDED TO CREATE THE OBJPDS01 MEMBERS.

  4.  I HAVE ENCLOSED SUCH A SAMPLE JOB, BUT DO NOT EXECUTE IT ON
        YOUR SYSTEM.  USE YOUR OWN SYSGEN ASSEMBLY STAGE2 DECK.
        (MY SAMPLE JOB IS LM023LNK.)
