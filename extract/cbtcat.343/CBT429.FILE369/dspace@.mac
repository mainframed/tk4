Attached you will find hopefully the last (for awhile) update to the
command processor DSPACE.

Improvements

1)  It still includes the change from using the UCB scan services
(found in the CVT) to using the UCBSCAN macro.  This was needed
for four digit addressing.

2)  The latest change came in the switch from issuing the SVC 78
direct (loading R0 with the address to the UCB, doing a load
address R1 to the message return area and then issuing SVC 78) to
using the LSPACE macros with the EXPMSG sub-parameter.  With the
EXPMSG parm LSPACE now passes back six digit information on free
space instead of four.  So it will now work on 3390 mod 9's.

If you have any questions please give me a call at (317) 578-6786.
