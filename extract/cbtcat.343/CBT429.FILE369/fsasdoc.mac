FSAS CONSISTS OF 3 COMPONENTS:

     3 - CLISTS ==>  FSAS      FSASCMD   FSASEMAC
     1 - PANEL  ==>  FSASP
     1 - MESSAGE MEMBER  ==> FSAS00

FSAS DOES NOT REQUIRE THE NEW SAS PRODUCT, SAS/DMI.  IT JUST USES THE
BATCH INTERFACE UNDER ISPF.  USE THE ISPF EDITOR UNDER FSAS TO MODIFY
CODE, AND ISPF BROWSE TO LOOK AT THE SAS LOG AND SAS LIST DATASETS.
THE INTERFACE IS SIMILAR TO THAT UNDER VM/CMS.
