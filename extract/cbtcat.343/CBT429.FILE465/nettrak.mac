Description-------------------------------------------------------------

          This dialog is from Dennis Buswell of the State of Montana
          (administration).

          The dialog is designed to aid users in reporting hardware
          problems to the network control area of the company. Some
          excellent ideas are presented in this dialog. Since it is
          customized for Dennises installation, there would be some
          modifications for it to be of use to your installation. The
          installation instructions allow you to emulate how the dialog
          runs at the State of Montana.
