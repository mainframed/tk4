Description-------------------------------------------------------------

          This is the logmsg command table command.

          It will allow a user to place or log a message into his ispf
          log. This is extremely helpful when debugging a dialog. A
          user may want to log a message saying he is at a certain point
          in the testing. For example:

          COMMAND ===> LOGMSG I AM DISPLAYING PANEL NOW - PHASE 2 BEGINS

          This will place a one line message into the users log with the
          above text.

          In addition, the user community can document a series of
          events they have done when encountering system problems. This
          eliminates the user from having to remember the events. To do
          this, the user would enter the command LOGMSG without any
          text. For example:

          COMMAND ===> LOGMSG

          This will display a panel that the user can enter
          text on and the user can continue to enter text until he enter
          the END command (PF3). This panel happens to use a dynamic
          panel area (in case you would like to see one in action).


Installation------------------------------------------------------------

1.        Update your current System Command Table (ISPCMDS) to include
          the follwoing entry:

          VERB    T    ACTION
          ----    -    ------
          LOGMSG  3    SELECT PGM(LOG0MSG) PARM(&ZPARM)


2.        The member in this PDS called LOGMSG@ contains JCL to move the
          appropriate components to their libraries. Run this JCL.
