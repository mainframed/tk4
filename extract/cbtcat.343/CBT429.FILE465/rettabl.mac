Description-------------------------------------------------------------

          When users write dialogs that create ISPF tables, they need to
          create unique table names for those tables. This allows
          recursive use of those dialogs with no fear of affecting a
          table currenly open.

          This module will dynamically allocate a temporary dataset to
          the programmers default unit (in UADS) and free it immediately
          using SVC 99. The program will trap the system generated
          ddname and return it to the caller. This system generated
          ddname is always unique and can be used as a table name. The
          first 3 bytes of the generated ddname is SYS and you may want
          to change it to your Dialog Application ID.

          To use this program from a dialog program, simply call
          RET0TABL passing it an 8 byte field. This field will be
          returned with the ISPF table name.

1.        The member in this PDS called RETTABL@ contains JCL to move
          the appropriate components to their libraries. Run this JCL.
