Description-------------------------------------------------------------

          In most installations, a great many dialogs are devoted to the
          function of ...

          DISPLAYing a Panel
          Various Edits
          FILE TAILOR some JCL.

          This CLIST is a Display and File Tailor general Dialog.

Using It----------------------------------------------------------------

          You normally invoke this dialog from a menu panel. For
          example, on a given menu panel, if a user selects option COMP,
          it will invoke this CLIST passing some parameters.

          The parameters it passes are as follows:

          EX 'LIB(DFTE)' 'panel skeleton panel2(...) skel2(...)'

          where panel is the Panel to be displayed, skeleton is the
          skeleton to file tailor. Panel2 and skeleton2 are additional
          panels and skeletons to be displayed.

          If the panel sets VERDSN1 thru VERDSN10 to a value other than
          spaces, the CLIST will verify that VERDSN1 is a valid existing
          dsname. If VERMEM1 is set to a member name, the CLIST will
          verify that VERMEM1 exists on the dataset by VERDSN1. If
          either of these verifications fail, an error message is issued
          and the cursor is placed on the field specified in VERCSR1.
          VERDSN1, VERMEM1 and VERCSR1 are all supported thru VERDSN10,
          VERMEM10 and VERCSR10.

          Job cards are automatically generated at the begining of the
          CLIST and it uses variables BJC1 thru BJC4. Finally, these job
          cards should be coded on the MENU  panel invoking this option.
          This will allow the user to modify them before invoking this
          command.

          If this is confusing or some option is not available, please
          contact
