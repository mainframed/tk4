Description-------------------------------------------------------------

          This is the KLIB TSO command.

          This TSO Command Processor is being enclosed on this tape
          because of its significant use in Dialog development.
          Normally, TSO commands are not maintained on the ISPF Dialog
          Tape.

          This command will display the datasets currently allocated to
          a given ddname that contain a member.  This is a TSO command
          and may be invoked from any ISPF screen by entering the
          following command on the command line:

          COMMAND ===> TSO KLIB ISPPLIB(ISR@PRIM)

          The above command will respond with a list of datasets
          currently allocated to ISPPLIB that contain member ISR@PRIM.
          Response may be:

          ISPPLIB DATASETS SEARCHED - ISR@PRIM FOUND ON:
          SYS1.ISPF.INSTALL
          SYS1.INST.ISPPLIB

Installation------------------------------------------------------------
