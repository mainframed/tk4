Description-------------------------------------------------------------

          This is the TSOCMD command table command.

          It will allow a user to invoke option 6 while on any screen.
          Since may times the ISPF Command Line is not long enough and
          if you are using the new option 6 delivered with this PDS it
          will remember the last command, it is very helpfull to say
          'bring up option 6' for a second. When hitting PF3 (END) you
          then return to the currently running
          function.

          For example:

          COMMAND ===> TSOCMD

          will put the user on the current option 6 found on ISR@PRIM.
          When the user hits the END Pfkey, he will return to this
          screen. A user may set a PFKEY to TSOCMD.


Installation------------------------------------------------------------

1.        Update your current System Command Table (ISPCMDS) to include
          the follwoing entry:

          VERB    T    ACTION
          ----    -    ------
          TSOCMD  0    SELECT PGM(TSO0CMD) NEWAPPL(ISR) PARM(&ZPARM)


2.        The member in this PDS called TSOCMD@ contains JCL to move
          the appropriate components to their libraries. Run this JCL.


3.        This program will actually look at the current Primary Option
          Menu and invoke option 6 the same way it does. If you have
          modified the option 6 on the primary option panel, you DO NOT
          have to modify this program.

Modifications ----------------------------------------------------------

85/04     This command used to only display option 6. Now, if the
          command is entered with some parms, for example:

          COMMAND ===> TSOCMD ALLOC F(X) SYSOUT(P)

          this command will initialize the option 6 screen with the
          command and hit enter for the user. The user remains in option
          6 as if he entered TSOCMD without any parms at all.
