Description-------------------------------------------------------------

          This is the BR command table command.

          It will allow a user to browse a dataset from any screen.
          It will allow the user to type the dataset name at command
          invokation time. For example:

          COMMAND ===> BR MY.DATA(X)

          will put the user directly into browse on MY.DATA(X). When
          the user finishes the browse, he returns to the currently
          running function.


Installation------------------------------------------------------------

1.        Update your current System Command Table (ISPCMDS) to include
          the follwoing entry:

          VERB    T    ACTION
          ----    -    ------
          BR      0    SELECT NEWAPPL(ISR) CMD(%CNAEBROW &ZPARM)


2.        The member in this PDS called BR@ contains JCL to move the
          appropriate components to their libraries. Run this JCL.

Modifications ----------------------------------------------------------

1.        Modified ACTION field in Command Table entry so that your
          default PFKeys and that are used when invoking browse with
          this command.

          This would be a problem if you install a package using a
          new Application Command Table. HSM 3.2 and JESMASTER are
          some examples.

2. 86/03  Added Panel and modified CLIST. If user enters an invalid
          dsname or one that is not allocated, he will now be prompted
          for a correct dsname - the old dsname is displayed so he
          may correct it.

3. 86/03  Now supports dialog BRLAST found on this tape.
