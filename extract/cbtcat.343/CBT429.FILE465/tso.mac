Description-------------------------------------------------------------

          This is the TSO0 Dialog Program.

          This program was written at CNA Insurance to replace the
          option 6 (TSO) delivered with the PDF Version of ISPF. The
          significant problem with that version is after typing a TSO
          command on the screen, if the user hit his PFk2 (SPLIT) screen
          key, the TSO command is lost.

       This version has the following features:

       1) The SPLIT screen bug described above is resolved.

       2) The user now has 2 data entry lines for option 6 (Similar to
          VM Version 2). The first data entry line is the regular ISPF
          Command Line and is used for that purpose. The Second data
          entry line is the TSO Command Line. This must only be used for
          TSO Commands. Command Stacking using a delimiter is supported
          for both lines.

       3) The screen will now remember the last command entered every
          time you invoke this option. If the last command was a stack
          of TSO Commands, it will now remember the entire list.

       4) When executing a stack of TSO Commands, if a command ends with
          a non-zero return code, the user will be prompted - do you
          want to continue or not.


Installation------------------------------------------------------------

1.        The member in this PDS called TSO@ contains JCL to move the
          appropriate components to their libraries. Run this JCL.
          This JCL will also assemble the source and link the program.

2.        Update your current Primary Option Menu so that Option 6 will
          now invoke the new program PGM(TSO0).

Modifications-----------------------------------------------------------

85/04     Version 2 of this command was modified to support the 8504
          Version 2 release of the TSOCMD command. See that command
          for a description.
