Description-------------------------------------------------------------

          This is the HOLD command table command.

          It will allow a user to save his current function status and
          invoke the Primary Option Panel. This is liking Stacking ISPF
          sessions. The user will be able to type

          COMMAND ===> HOLD 3.2

          The 3.2 is optional. This will hold his current function and
          invoke the Primary Option Menu. Because he typed 3.2, he would
          jump straight to option 3.2.

          When the user types =X to get out of the screen, he will
          resume the function executing when he typed HOLD. Some users
          may choose to set a PFKey to the word HOLD. This will act like
          a Pseudo SPLIT screen key (PF2).
