Description-------------------------------------------------------------

          This dialog was contributed by Lionell Dyck of Rockwell
          International.

          This dialog program will return to a user the different
          allocation charateristics of a dataset. This includes DCB
          information as well as allocation information.

          The EDIT MACRO GENJCL on this tape requires this program.

          To invoke this program from a CLIST, specify:

          ISPEXEC SELECT PGM(DSN0INFO) PARM(dsn-variable)

          where "dsn-variable" is the ISPF variable containing the DSN
          to be interogated.  The "dsn-variable" and the variables
          returned are all accessed in the SHARED pool.

          The following is a list of the Variable names returned:
          ALCYL     Allocated Cylinders
          ATRECFM   Record Format for ATTR
          BLKSIZE   Block Size
          CREDT     Creation Date
          DEVTYPE   Unit name for dataset
          DIRALLOC  # Alloc Dir Blocks
          DIRUSE    # Used Dir Blocks
          DSORG     Dataset Organization
          EX        # of extents
          GCREDT    Gregorian Creation date
          GUSEDT    Gregorian Used date
          USCYL     Used Cylinders
          KEYLEN    Key Length
          LRECL     Logical Record Length
          MEMBER    Member name (or blank)
          RECFM     Record Format
          RKP       Relative Key Position
          SCALO     Secondary Allocation
          TRALC     Tracks Allocated
          TRUSE     Tracks Used
          UNIT      Allocation Unit Type
          USEDT     Last Used Date
          VOLSER    Volser of dataset

          Return Codes:  0   OK
                        99   Dataset not found or unavaiable

Installation------------------------------------------------------------

1.        The member in this PDS called DSNINFO@ contains JCL to move
          the appropriate components to their libraries. Run this JCL.


Modifications-----------------------------------------------------------

1. 86/03  Fixed the VPUT and VGET parameters to always use the SHARED
          pool. Before it was using the ASIS parm.
