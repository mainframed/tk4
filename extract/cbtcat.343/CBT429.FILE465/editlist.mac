          Its documentation said to install this as a replacement for
          the current PDF option 2. It is suggested by the maintainers
          of this tape that it not "replace" option 2. One
          implementation would be the creation of command table command.

          The current Option 2 remembers only 1 dataset name. This can
          be very frustrating at times when a user access multiple
          datasets interchangably. This option offers one solution.

          It allows a user to remember over 10 different dataset names
          for the editor.

Installation------------------------------------------------------------

1.        Update your current System Command Table (ISPCMDS) to include
          the follwoing entry:

          VERB     T    ACTION
          ----     -    ------
          EDITLIST 0    SELECT CMD(%EDTE) newappl(isr)


2.        The member in this PDS called EDITLIS@ contains JCL to move
          the appropriate components to their libraries. Run this JCL.
