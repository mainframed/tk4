Description-------------------------------------------------------------

          This command will create a list (similar to a member list)
          containing all dataset allocated to a user.

          The output is in the following format.

          DDNAME   VOLSER  DSNAME

          From this member list, a user can Browse, Edit, Invoke PDS
          DSAT (from CBT TAPE) the dsnames in the list.

          If you do not have the DSAT TSO command (from the CBT Tape)
          you may disable this in the PROC section of the panel LSTDA.

          The dialog is invoked by a user typing LISTA from any screen.
          The primary command FULL exapnds the table to list all
          datasets in the concatenation. Compress will only list the
          first dataset in the concatenation.

          All line commands are documented on the HELP panel LSTHA.

          The default display when first invoked is in the compressed
          format described above. You may choose the FULL format
          by typing LISTA FULL on the command line.

          ----     -    ------
          LISTA    0    SELECT PGM(LST0A) NEWAPPL(ISR) PARM(&ZPARM)


2.        The member in this PDS called LISTA@ contains JCL to move
          the appropriate components to their libraries. Run this JCL.


Modifications-----------------------------------------------------------

1. 86/03  Updated command to have Locate command work identical to ISPF.
          If locate operand matches identically, scroll to member else
          scroll to first entry before GE then the key.

2. 86/03  Added SETPROF command to support setting edit profile.

3. 86/03  When invoking the LISTA command, you may now specify DDnames.
          For example, LISTA SYSPROC SYSHELP will only list SYSPROC
          and SYSHELP in the table display. You may also specify
          a generic DDname, for example LISTA ISP* will list all
          DDnames beginning with ISP. You may list up to 50 DDnames
          (generic or full).
