Description-------------------------------------------------------------

          This dialog is a nifty dialog from Mike Botos of House
          Information Systems in Washington. It will allow a user to
          secure his terminal. This means that someone cannot walk over
          to your terminal while your logged on and play under your ID.

          Because of its use, its installation instructions specifies
          its implementation via a Command Table Command "SECURE". This
          means you may type SECURE from any screen and secure the
          terminal. When you type your pass- word, the security
          disappears and you are back where you were.

          A modification by GUIDE ISPF for ISPF V2 is the addition of an
          ISPEXEC CONTROL NOCMD issued before every display of a panel
          making this security fool-proof.

Installation------------------------------------------------------------

1.        Update your current System Command Table (ISPCMDS) to include
          the follwoing entry:

          VERB    T    ACTION
          ----    -    ------
          SECURE  0    SELECT PGM(TRM0LOCK) NEWAPPL(ISR)


2.        The member in this PDS called TRMLOCK@ contains JCL to move
          the appropriate components to their libraries. Run this JCL.
