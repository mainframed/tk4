Description-------------------------------------------------------------

          This is the DSINDEX dialog.

          It will allow a user to specify an index level (similar to
          option 3.4 of ISPF Version 2) and it will return a list of
          datasets conforming to that index level. It also allows you
          to limit the search to DASD, TAPE (neither or both) type
          datasets.
Installation------------------------------------------------------------

1.        Update a menu panel to invoke PGM(DSINDEX)

2.        The member in this PDS called DSINDEX@ contains JCL to move
          the appropriate components to their libraries. Run this JCL.
