Description-------------------------------------------------------------

          This is the KDSN TSO command.

          This TSO Command Processor is being enclosed on this tape
          because of its significant use in Dialog development.
          Normally, TSO commands are not maintained on the ISPF Dialog
          Tape.

          This command will display the datasets that are currently
          allocated to a given ddname. This is a TSO command and may
          be invoked from any ISPF screen by entering the following
          command on the command line:

          COMMAND ===> TSO KDSN ISPPLIB

          The above command will respond with a list of datasets
          currently allocated to ISPPLIB. This list is more readable and
          easier to obtain the the TSO LISTA command. Response may be:

          ISPPLIB ALLOCATED TO:
          SYS1.ISPF.ISRPLIB
          SYS1.ISPF.ISPPLIB
          SYS1.INST.ISPPLIB
