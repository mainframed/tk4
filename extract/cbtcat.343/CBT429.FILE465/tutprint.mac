Description-------------------------------------------------------------

          This dialog is a nifty dialog that prints off tutorials.
          You specify the highest level tutorial panel and if they
          are connected correctly, it will print them off with a
          table of contents.

Installation------------------------------------------------------------

1.        Update a panel to invoke SELECT PGM(TUTPRNT1)

2.        The member in this PDS called TUTPRIN@ contains JCL to move
          the appropriate components to their libraries. Run this JCL.
