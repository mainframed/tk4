Description-------------------------------------------------------------

          When users write dialogs that create ISPF tables, they need to
          create unique table names for those tables. This allows
          recursive use of those dialogs with no fear of affecting a
          table currenly open.

          This module will dynamically allocate a temporary dataset to
          the programmers default unit (in UADS) and free it immediately
          using SVC 99. The program will trap the system generated
          ddname and return it to the caller. This system generated
          ddname is always unique and can be used as a table name. The
          first 3 bytes of the generated ddname is SYS and you may want
          to change it to your Dialog Application ID.

          This program will return into a Shared Pool Variable, a
          unique ISPF table name.

          This is not designed to be used from a dialog program. For
          a dialog program, see RETTABL (another dialog on this tape).
          To use this from a CLIST, issue the following CLIST commands:

          ISPEXEC SELECT PGM(GET0TABL) PARM(variable-name)
          ISPEXEC VGET (variable-name) SHARED

          where variable-name is any variable you want the program to
          return the ISPF table name into.

          the appropriate components to their libraries. Run this JCL.
