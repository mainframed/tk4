Description-------------------------------------------------------------

          One productivity improvement you may make to your BR dialog
          is the ability to browse the last dataset browsed again with-
          out having to retype the dsname.

          The BR command syntax would be BR * instead of BR dsname.
          The asterk specifies last dsname browsed.

          Below you will find code you may add to the Browse panels so
          that users may use this command.

Installation------------------------------------------------------------

1.        ISPF, as delivered uses panel ISRBROB for browse and also has
          panel ISRBROBF. The second panel is user modifiable per the
          ISPF Installation and Customization Panel. You should make the
          following changes to both panels. If your users have created
          their own browse panel, they too should be modified.

          To the above panels do the following:

          Add to the INIT section the following code:

          )INIT

           &BRDSN = &ZDSN
           &BRMEM = &ZMEMB
           VPUT (BRDSN BRMEM) PROFILE
