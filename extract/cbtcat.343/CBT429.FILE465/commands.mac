Description-------------------------------------------------------------

          This command will list all current ISPF commands that a user
          may view.

          It will present is table format the VERB, TRUNCATE value and
          the Description field of the system command table.

          Commands that are in an application table other than ISP will
          be denoted with a "*". Commands found in both an application
          table and the ISP command table will be denoted with "**".

          In addition, a user is able to select any command and he will
          be presented with a tutorial for that command.

Installation------------------------------------------------------------

1.        Update your current System Command Table (ISPCMDS) to include
          the follwoing entry:

          VERB     T    ACTION
          ----     -    ------
          COMMANDS 0    SELECT PGM(CMD0TABL)


2.        The member in this PDS called COMMAND@ contains JCL to move
          the appropriate components to their libraries. Run this JCL.

3.        If a user selects a command from the list, the dialog will
          attempt to invoke the tutorial program ISPTUTOR against a
          panel. The panel name is a $ followed by the command name.
          For example, if the command is END, the dialog invokes
          ISPTUTOR against $END.

Modifications ----------------------------------------------------------

1. 8505   Modified by Bob Zimmerman of CNA Insurance.
          It does not require the SYSCMDS (old version did).
          Also, if the user is in a NEWAPPL, the new applications
          command table is processed and its commands are highlighted.

2. 8506   Modified by Bob Zimmerman of CNA Insurance.
          Had a bug with the TBPUT on duplicate commands when under
          a new application.

          Added ORDER keyword to TBPUT - problem fixed.

3. 8508   Converted CLIST to program to improve performance. Added
          Line Command abilities. Option S will allow a user to invoke
          tutorial on the command.
