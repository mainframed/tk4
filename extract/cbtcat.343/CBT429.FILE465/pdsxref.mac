Description-------------------------------------------------------------

          This is the PDSXREF Dialog.

          This dialog will create a member list of up to four PDS's.
          Unlike the typical member lists facilities of ISPF, if there
          are duplicate members, they will be shown on the member list.
          Currently, the member list is used just to display duplicates;
          In the future, you will be able to Browse, Edit etc...

Installation------------------------------------------------------------

1.        The member in this PDS called PDSXREF@ contains JCL to move
          appropriate components to their libraries. Run this JCL.  This
          JCL will also assemble the source and link the program.

2.        Update a Menu Panel to invoke PDSXREF using CMD(%PDSEXREF).
