          One productivity improvement you may make to your ED dialog
          is the ability to edit the dataset you are currently or the
          last dataset you have browsed.

          This does not edit the last dataset you have edited.
          See paragraph above.

          Install ED command and BRLAST and your support for this is
          installed. Invoke by the command ED *.
