Description-------------------------------------------------------------

          This is the KDDN TSO command.

          This TSO Command Processor is being enclosed on this tape
          because of its significant use in Dialog development.
          Normally, TSO commands are not maintained on the ISPF Dialog
          Tape.

          This command will display the ddnames that currently have
          allocated a given dsname. This is a TSO command and may
          be invoked from any ISPF screen by entering the following
          command on the command line:

          COMMAND ===> TSO KDDN ('SYS1.ISPF.ISPPLIB' 'TERMFILE')

          The above command may respond with:

          'SYS1.ISPF.ISPPLIB' ALLOCATED TO:
          ISPPLIB  002 IN CONCATENATION
          ISR0002

          'TERMFILE' ALLOCATED TO:
          SYSOUT
          SYSPRINT
