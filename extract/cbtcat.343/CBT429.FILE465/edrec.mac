Description-------------------------------------------------------------

          This is a CLIST in the CLIB file or Assembler source in
          the  Source file.

          In ISPF Version 2, edit recovery is the responsability
          of the dialog. This CLIST should be executed at the front of
          any dialog that supports the edit service.

          If the CLIST/PGM ends with return code 20 the dialog should
          not continue - it should exit.

1.        The member in this PDS called EDREC@ contains JCL to move
          the appropriate components of the program version to the
          appropriate libraries. The CLIST version should be manually
          moved into a SYSPROC library.
