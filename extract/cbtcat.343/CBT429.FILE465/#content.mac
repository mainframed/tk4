There is no implied support for any dialogs on this tape.

Dialogs submitted as contributions are subject to review for conformity
to the standards presented by the GUIDE ISPF Project at Guide 60; a copy
of this document may be found on the DOCS file of this tape.  Any
modifications to a submitted dialog will be reviewed with the author.
The author always has the right to withdraw a dialog because he does not
want the modifications made to his code.

The above policy has been established by the GUIDE ISPF Project to make
available to its users a reliable tape. The tape should be easily
installed and hopefully maintainable for future versions of the ISPF
product.

If multiple users submit a common dialog (their dialogs perform similar
functions), an attempt will be made to produce one dialog containing the
best features of all. The new dialog would be sent to the original
submitters.  When appropriate, the original dialogs will also be
available on the tape (conforming to standards).

This PDS members are in the following format:
*********************************************


All members ending with non-special characters are Dialog description
and install instructions.

All members ending with @ are installation JCL members for the dialog.

Member #UPDATE contains a list of all Dialogs and their last
modification date. This allows you only to unload or test the new
versions of a dialog (instead of reinstalling all of them).

Member #MOD is similar to #UPDATE. It is maintained in date order
and contains a brief description of the update.
