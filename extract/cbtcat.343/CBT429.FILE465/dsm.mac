Description-------------------------------------------------------------

          This command allows a user to maintain a list of Dsnames in
          an ISPF table across ISPF sessions (permanent table).

          From this list a user is able to Insert, Delete and Repeat
          the Dsnames in order to maintain the list of dsnames.

          In addition to the above line commands, a user is able to
          Edit, Browse, invoke the PDS command and the DSAT command
          (the DSAT command is from the CBT tape).

          If you do not have the DSAT TSO command (from the CBT Tape)
          you may disable this in the PROC section of panels
          DSNBMGF and DSNBMGF1.

          An installation can add line commands by updating the PROC
          section of the panels mentioned above. No source needs to
          be updated. Any new line commands added should set the
          variable ZSEL to the operand of the SELECT service. See
          the panels for more.

          The dialog is invoked by a user typing DSM from any screen.
          The primary commands are documented on the tutorial screens.

          All line commands are documented on the Tutorial screens.
