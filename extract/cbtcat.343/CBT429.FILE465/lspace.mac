Description-------------------------------------------------------------

          This is the LSP0ACE Dialog Program

          This dialog will display the free space available for a given
          volume. In addition to specifying a single volume, a user can
          specify a generic volser. For example, TSDA* will display free
          space in an ISPF table format for all volumes begining with
          TSDA.

Installation------------------------------------------------------------

1.        The member in this PDS called LSPACE@ contains JCL to move the
          appropriate components to their libraries. Run this JCL.  This
          JCL will also assemble the source and link the program.

2.        Update your current Primary Option Menu or the option 3 menu
          to include access to this function. The new option should
          invoke the program PGM(LSP0ACE).
