Description-------------------------------------------------------------

          This is the KED command table command.

          It will allow a user to invoke the ISPF Editor based on a
          given ddname. A great deal of power may be found when using
          this command in dialog writing. For example:

          COMMAND ===> KED ISPPLIB

          will bring up an MSL containing a list of datasets allocated
          to ISPPLIB.  This function does not use the Library Access
          Services available with Version 2 of ISPF. The facility limits
          the ddname to 4 datasets. In the above example, If ISPPLIB is
          allocated to only one dataset, the user would directly enter
          edit on that dataset.

          If the user desires, he can enter a member name with the
          ddname. For example:

          COMMAND ===> KED ISPPLIB(ISR@PRIM)

          The above command scans the datasets allocated to ISPPLIB. If
          the member ISR@PRIM exists in only one dataset, the user
          enters edit directly on that dataset. If the member exists in
          more than one dataset, an MSL of datasets is displayed. The
          list of datasets displayed are only those datasets containing
          the member.

          The command also support PROFILE, MACRO and the keyword FIRST.
          See the HELP member for more.


Installation------------------------------------------------------------

1.        Update your current System Command Table (ISPCMDS) to include
          the follwoing entry:

          VERB    T    ACTION
          ----    -    ------
          KED     0    SELECT PGM(CNA0KED) NEWAPPL(ISR)  PARM(&ZPARM)


2.        The member in this PDS called KED@ contains JCL to move the
          appropriate components to their libraries. Run this JCL.

3.        The dialog on this tape called EDREC should be installed
          for support of EDIT RECOVERY.

Modifications ----------------------------------------------------------

1.        Modified ACTION field in Command Table entry so that your
          default PFKeys and Edit Profiles are used when invoking
          edit with this command.

          This would be a problem if you install a package using a
          new Application Command Table. HSM 3.2 and JESMASTER are
          some examples.

2.        Modified KED to check for EDIT Recovery before begining.
