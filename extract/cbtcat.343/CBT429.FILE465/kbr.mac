Description-------------------------------------------------------------

          This is the KBR command table command.

          It will allow a user to invoke ISPF Browse based on a
          given ddname. a great deal of power may be found when using
          this command in dialog writing. For example:

          COMMAND ===> KBR ISPPLIB

          will bring up an MSL containing a list of datasets allocated
          to ISPPLIB.  This function does not use the Library Access
          Services available with Version 2 of ISPF. The facility limits
          the ddname to 4 datasets. In the above example, If ISPPLIB is
          allocated to only one dataset, the user would directly enter
          browse on that dataset.

          If the user desires, he can enter a member name with the
          ddname. For example:

          COMMAND ===> KBR ISPPLIB(ISR@PRIM)

          The above command scans the datasets allocated to ISPPLIB. If
          the member ISR@PRIM exists in only one dataset, the user
          enters browse directly on that dataset. If the member exists
          in more than one dataset, an MSL of datasets is displayed. The
          list of datasets displayed are only those datasets containing
          the member.

          See the HELP member for more.


Installation------------------------------------------------------------

1.        Update your current System Command Table (ISPCMDS) to include
          the follwoing entry:

          VERB    T    ACTION
          ----    -    ------
          KBR     0    SELECT PGM(CNA0KBR) NEWAPPL(ISR) PARM(&ZPARM)


2.        The member in this PDS called KBR@ contains JCL to move the
          appropriate components to their libraries. Run this JCL.

Modifications ----------------------------------------------------------

1.        Modified ACTION field in Command Table entry so that your
          default PFKeys that are used when invoking browse with this
          command.

          This would be a problem if you install a package using a
          new Application Command Table. HSM 3.2 and JESMASTER are
          some examples.
