Description-------------------------------------------------------------

          The most significant problem dialog developers have with using
          a new Application Id (NEWAPPL) is the modification of users
          Pfkeys.

          By invoking a dialog with a NEWAPPL, the user gets a new
          Profile Pool and the Pfkeys will all default to the default
          member in ISPTLIB.  These default are often not desired by the
          typical user.  In addition, there are some users that would
          like to have a different set of Pfkeys under a given dialog
          running as a NEWAPPL.  It is difficult to please both users.

          Some examples of current products that are required to run as
          a NEWAPPL is HSM, JESMASTER and SDSF (to name just a few).

          The PFKINIT command allows a user, under a given NEWAPPL, to
          copy the current values for the Pfkeys used under regular PDF.
          If I enter HSM for the first time and wish to initialize my
          Pfkeys to the values I use everywhere else under PDF, I can
          type the command PFKINIT and those values are copied. I may
          now change one or two Pfkeys to be HSM dependent. This does
          not affect my regular PDF Pfkeys and they will always be
          unique under HSM.

Installation------------------------------------------------------------

1.        Update your current System Command Table (ISPCMDS) to include
          the follwoing entry:

          VERB    T    ACTION
          ----    -    ------
          PFKINIT 0    SELECT PGM(PFK0INIT)


2.        The member in this PDS called PFKINIT@ contains JCL to move
          the appropriate components to their libraries. Run this JCL.
