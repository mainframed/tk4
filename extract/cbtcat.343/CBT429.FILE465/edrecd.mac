Description-------------------------------------------------------------

          This is a CLIST in the CLIB file.

          In ISPF Version 2, edit recovery is the responsability
          of the dialog. This CLIST should be executed at the front of
          any dialog that supports the edit service.

          If the CLIST ends with return code 20 the dialog should
          not continue - it should exit.

          This CLIST differs from the EDREC clist because it only
          processes recovery of a specified dataset.
