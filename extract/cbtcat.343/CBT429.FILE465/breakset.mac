Description-------------------------------------------------------------

          This dialog is a nifty dialog that help programmers set
          breakpoints while they are using Dialog Test. Nomrally,
          a programmer has to type every service he wants a breakpoint
          for in option 7.8 of PDF TEST. The only problem with that
          is if you want a breakpoint for all Table services, you will
          be doing alot of typing.

          This Dialog allows a user, when in option 7.8, to type
          a new command, Breakset, and a panel will be displayed.
          The user can then specify a category of services to be
          used for breakpoints.

          The next scroll the user issues from option 7.8 will fill
          the screen with all services of that category.

          The author has documented that because this is playing
          with internals, its integrity is not guaranteed to work
          through all versions of all put-levels of ISPF.

          If you prefer not to install as a Command Table Command,
          you may invoke from option 8 screen using a TSO CALL
          statement (under version 2 of ISPF).

Installation------------------------------------------------------------

1.        Update your current System Command Table (ISPCMDS) to include
          the follwoing entry:

          VERB     T    ACTION
          ----     -    ------
          BREAKSET 0    &BREAKSET


2.        If you are installing this command in the command table (as
          above), modify IBM panel (ISRYBP1) to include in the INIT
          section:
          &BREAKSET = 'SELECT PGM(BREAKSET)'

          and in the REINIT section:
          &BREAKSET = 'SELECT PGM(BREAKSET)'

          and in the PROC section:
          &BREAKSET = ' '

3.        The member in this PDS called BREAKSE@ contains JCL to move
          the appropriate components to their libraries. Run this JCL.
