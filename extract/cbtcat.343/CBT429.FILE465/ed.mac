Description-------------------------------------------------------------

          This is the ED command table command.

          It will allow a user to edit a dataset from any screen.
          It will allow the user to type the dataset name at command
          invokation time. For example:

          COMMAND ===> ED MY.DATA(X) PROFILE(CLIST)

          will put the user directly into edit on MY.DATA(X). When
          the user finishes the edit, he returns to the currently
          running function.


Installation------------------------------------------------------------

1.        Update your current System Command Table (ISPCMDS) to include
          the follwoing entry:

          VERB    T    ACTION
          ----    -    ------
          ED      0    SELECT NEWAPPL(ISR) CMD(%CNAEEDIT &ZPARM)


2.        The member in this PDS called ED@ contains JCL to move the
          appropriate components to their libraries. Run this JCL.

3.        This dialog requires the EDRECD dialog (CLIST) be moved to
          SYSPROC to support edit recovery.

Modifications ----------------------------------------------------------

1.        Modified ACTION field in Command Table entry so that your
          default PFKeys and Edit Profiles are used when invoking
          edit with this command.

          This would be a problem if you install a package using a
          new Application Command Table. HSM 3.2 and JESMASTER are
          some examples.

2.        Edit Recovery is now checked for the dsn you request edit
          on.

3. 86/03  Added error recovery so if user enters invalid dsname he
          is displayed dsname and is prompted for correct dsname.
