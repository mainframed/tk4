Description-------------------------------------------------------------

          This command will display the current active tasks on the
          system. I saw the DA command on the CBT tape, modified its
          TPUTs to TBADDs, wrote a front end and now I have an ISPF
          dialog that will list the current system tasks using full
          screen mode.

          Some features include the optional display of TSO users,
          sorting the display by Jobname, Elapsed time or CPU time, and
          an AUTO Primary command to automatically update your screen
          (with your keyboard locked).

          A full tutorial panel is available.

Installation------------------------------------------------------------

1.        Under MVS/XA, this program should be linked with AMODE 31.
          This is the way the dialog is delivered. For MVS 370 systems,
          you may have to run the program authorized (as well as be
          AMODE24.

2.        The member in this PDS called JOBLIST@ contains JCL to move
          the appropriate components to their libraries. Run this JCL.

3.        Update a menu panel (possible option 3) to include an option
          that will invoke PGM(JOB0LIST).
