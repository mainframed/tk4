********************   WHATS NEW  *************************

 THIS SECTION DESCRIBES THE THE CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE OLD
 PRODUCTION BROWSE SERVICE ROUTINES (4.S).


 1) THE MULTIPLE DAILY/ARCHIVE JOURNAL DATASETS HAVE BEEN CONVERTED
    TO ONE VSAM JOURNAL: THE RECORD IS 42 BYTES AND IS IN THE FOLLOWING
    FORMAT:

    BYTES      DESCRIPTION
    -----      -------------------------------------------------------
    1-8        JOB NAME (1 TO 8 CHARACTERS)

    9-13       DATE - IN PACKED REVERSED FORMAT (PL5)
               THE DATE IS REVERSED (IE: PL5'0999999999' MINUS DATE) SO
               THAT THE RECORD IS STORED IN THE VSAM FILE WITH THE
               LATEST RUN OF THE JOB THE FIRST RECORD READ. (LIFO)
               BEFORE PACKING, THE DATE IS IN THE FORMAT: YYYYMMDD
               THE FULL YEAR IS USED FOR YEAR 2000 COMPATABILITY.

    14-17      TIME - IN PACKED REVERSED FORMAT (PL4)
               THE TIME IS REVERSED (IE: PL4'09999999' MINUS TIME) SO
               THAT THE RECORD IS STORED IN THE VSAM FILE WITH THE
               LATEST RUN OF THE JOB THE FIRST RECORD READ. (LIFO)
               BEFORE PACKING, THE TIME IS IN THE FORMAT: HHMMSS

    18-25      JOB NUMBER IN THE FORMAT: 99999JOB , 99999STC , 99999TSU

    26         MSGCLASS OF THE JOB WHEN WRITTEN TO DISKWTR

    27-29      TTR - THIS IS THE RELATIVE TTR CALCULATED WHEN THE
               SEPERATOR RECORD IS WRITTEN TO THE ACTIVE OR DAILY DISK
               DATASETS. IT IS SET TO ZERO WHEN THE DATA IS ON TAPE.

    30         A ONE BYTE INDICATOR OF THE DAY OF THE WEEK WHEN THE JOB
               WAS ADDED TO THE DISKWTR SYSTEM (X'00'-MON; X'06'-SUN)

    31-34      NUMBER OF LINES IN THE SYSOUT REPORT. (PL4). IT IS SET
               TO ZERO WHEN THE RECORD IS FIRST WRITTEN ON THE ACTIVE
               FILE (WILL SHOW UP IN 4.S AS ?) AND IS CALCULATED WHEN
               SAVEWTR MOVES THE DATA FROM THE ACTIVE TO THE DAILY FILE.
               (IF CONVERTING, THE OLD SYSOUT REPORTS ALSO SHOW UP AS?).

    35         IS THE DEVICE TYPE WHERE THE DATA EXISTS. IF ON TAPE,
               IT IS SET TO 'T' OR IF ON DISK, IT IS THE DEVICE CODE
               (IE: X'2E' - FOR A 3380)

    36         IS THE DATASET TYPE USED TO EXPAND THE SYSOUT DATASET
               NAME ALONG WITH THE STAMP(NEXT ENTRY).
               A-ACTIVE; D-DAILY; R-ARCHIVE; O-OLD SYSTEM ARCHIVE

    37-42      IS THE DATASET DATE/TIME STAMP (PL6). IT IS USED ALONG
               WITH THE DATASET TYPE ABOVE TO CREATE THE DATASET NAME
               WHERE THE SYSOUT REPORT EXISTS. THIS FIELD CONSISTS
               OF THE DATE IN THE FORMAT: XYYMMDD WERE 'X' IS THE FIRST
               CHARACTER OF THE FULL YEAR (IE: 1 FOR 1984 OR 2 FOR 2001)
               THE TIME IS IN THE FORMAT: HHMM. THESE TWO FILES ARE
               THEN PLACED TOGETHER AND PACKED (IE:XYYMMDDHHMM).
               THIS FIELD IS SET TO ALL 9'S WHEN THE DATASET TYPE IS
               THE ACTIVE FILE. IF CONVERTING ON ARE KEEPING THE OLD
               SYSOUT GDG'S, THE FIRST 5 CHARACTERS ARE SET TO 9'S
               AND THE GDG NUMBER AND VERSION NUMBER ARE ADDED AND THE
               FIELD IS PACKED (IE: 99999001000  FOR  G0010V00)


 2) AS STATED ABOVE, IN THE DATE DESCRIPTION, THIS SYSTEM IS
    YEAR 2000 COMPATABLE.


 3) A COMPRESSION ROUTINE HAS BEEN ADDED TO COMPRESS THE DATA WHEN IT
    IS OFFLOADED FROM THE ACTIVE TO THE DAILY FILES. THE COMPRESSION
    ROUTINE COMPRESSION ANY OCCURENCE OF 4 OR MORE OF THE SAME CHAR.
    THIS ROUTINE WILL ALSO DE-COMPRESS THE DATA FOR BROWSING.
    SEE THE SOUTCPR PROGRAM FOR MORE DETAIL OF THE COMPRESSION.


 4) DATASET GDG'S ARE NO LONGER NEEDED. WHEN DATASETS ARE CREATED,
    THEY ARE DATE/TIME STAMPED. THIS ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR SECOND
    OR THIRD DATASET QUALIFIERS (IE: SYS2.OPSWTR AND SYS2.OPSTAPE)
    USED FOR KEEPING DATA OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME.


 5) SAVEWTR NOW DOES ALL THE ALLOCATION OF DAILY AND ARCHIVE FILES
    DYNAMICALLY. SOME OF THE OPTIONS OF SAVEWTR (SEE THE SAVEWTR
    PROGRAM FOR COMPLETE DISCRIPTION) FOLLOW:

      A) COPY THE ACTIVE FILE TO DAILY TAPES

      B) COPY THE ACTIVE FILE TO DAILY DISKS
         AND OFFLOAD OLD DAILY DISKS TO ARCHIVE TAPES.
         (THIS IS CONTROLLED BY THE DAYS PARM FOR SOUTWTR)
         WHEN COPYING TO DAILY DISKS, YOU CAN SPECIFY ANY DISK (SYSDA)
         OR YOU CAN SPECIFY 1 TO 3 DESIGNATED PACKS. WHEN YOU SPECIFY
         2 OR 3 PACKS, THE PACK WITH THE MOST SPACE WILL BE CHOOSEN.

      C) FORMAT THE ACTIVE FILE

      D) REBUILD THE VSAM INDEX. IT WILL READ ALL THE ACTIVE,DAILY
         AND ARCHIVE DATASETS AND REBUILD THE VSAM RECORDS WHEN
         SEPERATOR RECORDS ARE FOUND. A PARM PASSED REQUESTS A
         REBUILD OF EVERYTHIHG OR SELECTED TYPES (IE: ONLY DAILY)

      E) WILL READ AN INPUT TAPE AND CUT A NEW DAILY OR ARCHIVE TAPE
         AND ALSO ADD OR UPDATE THE VSAM JOURNAL RECORDS. THIS OPTION
         CAN BE USED IF A TAPE IS SNAPPED. YOU COULD USE DEBE TO COPY
         THE BROKEN TAPE TO A NEW TAPE AND THEN USE THE NEW TAPE AS
         INPUT INTO SAVEWTR.


 6) WHEN SAVEWTR IS CREATING TAPES, EITHER DAILY OR ARCHIVE, IT WILL
    ALWAYS MOD ON TO THE LAST TAPE USED. WHEN A TAPE IS CLOSE TO
    BEING FULL, SAVEWTR WILL AUTOMATICALLY CLOSE THAT TAPE DATASET
    AND START A NEW DATASET ON A FRESH TAPE. A FULL TAPE HAS BEEN
    ESTIMATED AT APPROXIMATELY 2000 FT. THIS IS ENOUGH SLACK FOR
    SHORT REELS. THIS LOGIC SHOULD ELIMINATE MULTI-REEL DAILY AND
    ARCHIVE TAPES. BECAUSE OF THE DATE/TIME STAMPING OF DATASETS,
    THE NEED FOR GDG'S , MULTIPLE DATASET PREFIXES AND THE NEED TO
    RUN ARCHWTR AND ARCH HISTORY JOBS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED.

 7) THE SPF 4.S PANELS HAVE BEEN MODIFIED. THE TABLE OPTION NOW SHOWS
    THE DAY(MON TUE ETC.), NUMBER OF LINES AND IF THE SYSOUT IS ONLINE
    OR ON TAPE. TO PROVIDE FOR THESE FIELDS, THE DATASET NAME WAS TAKEN
    OFF OF THE PANEL. IF YOU NEED TO SEE A DATASET NAME, ENTER "Q"
    NEXT TO A SYSOUT REPORT AND THE JOURNAL AND DAILY/ARCHIVE DATASET
    NAMES ARE SUPPLIED.

    ALSO, OPTION 5.S (BATCH) HAS BEEN MERGED INTO 4.S. FROM ONE PANEL,
    YOU CAN NOW SELECT A JOB FOR ONLINE BROWSE OR FOR BATCH SUBMISSION.


 8) THIS SYSTEM IS NOT COMPATABLE WITH THE OLD SYSTEM.
    (YOUR OLD SOUTXIT CAN STILL BE USED - SEE #10)
    ALL OF THE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN MODIFIED TO USE THE NEW
    VSAM JOURNAL.

    THE ONLY COMPATABILITY BETWEEN THIS SYSTEM AND THE OLD, IS THAT
    THIS SYSTEM CAN READ THE OLD SYSOUT TAPES IN A NON-COMPRESSED STATE.
    THIS WAS NEEDED SO THAT YOU WOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO READ ALL OF
    YOUR OLD DAILY/ARCHIVE TAPES THRU THE NEW SAVEWTR PROGRAM.
    (EVEN THOUGH YOU CAN IF YOU WANT TO; USING THE FIXTAPE OPTION)
    A CONVERT PROGRAM IS SUPPLIED THAT READS YOUR OLD JOURNAL DATASETS
    AND CREATES VSAM RECORDS WITH A GDG FORMATTED DATE/ TIME
    STAMP. (SEE EXPLANATION OF THE DATE/TIME STAMP IN #1 ABOVE)


 9) A CLEAN PROGRAM (SOUTCLN) IS SUPPLIED WHICH WILL RUN THRU THE
    VSAM JOURNAL AND PERFORM THE FOLLOWING TASKS:

      A) DELETE ALL OLD VSAM RECORDS BASED ON A DAYS OLD PARAMETER.

      B) MONITOR THE AMOUNT OF VALID DATA ON DAILY/ARCHIVE DATASETS
         AND DYNAMICALLY DELETE ANY TAPES OR DISKS THAT ARE
         DETERMINED TO BE EMPTY.

      C) OPTIONALLY CREATE A REPORT OF ANY SYSOUT THAT EXCEEDS A
         SPECIFIED NUMBER OF LINES. (IE: WILL REPORT ON ANY SYSOUT
         REPORT THAT IS LARGER THAN 20,000 LINES). THIS REPORT LOOKS
         AT THE LAST 7 DAYS ONLY.


 10) YOUR OLD SOUTXIT PROGRAM IS CAN BE USED WITHOUT ANY CHANGES.
     THE DATA IS STILL PASSED TO IT IN THE SAME FORMAT.


 11) SAVEWTR WILL HANDLE CREATING DAILY DATASETS ON DISK OR TAPE.
     YOU CAN ALSO CHANGE FROM TAPE TO DISK OR FROM DISK TO TAPE
     AT ANY TIME. THIS ALLOWS YOU TO KEEP DAILYS ON DISK AND ONLY
     COPY OLD DAILY DISKS TO ARCHIVE TAPE. IF YOU RUN LOW ON DISK
     SPACE, YOU CAN, ON THE FLY, CHANGE SAVEWTR TO PUT THE DAILYS
     TO TAPE. AT A LATER TIME, YOU CAN PUT THE DAILYS BACK TO DISK.
     SAVEWTR WILL ALWAYS PLACES ARCHIVED DATASETS ON TAPE, BUT DAILY
     DATASETS CAN BE PLACED ON EITHER DISK OR TAPE.

     NOTE: IF YOU CHANGE DAILYS FROM DISK TO TAPE, THE EXISTING
           DISK DAILY DATASETS WILL FIRST BE COPIED TO THE ARCHIVE
           TAPE AND THEN THE ACTIVE FILE WILL BE COPIED TO DAILY TAPE.
           (SEE EXPLANATION THE THE SOUTSWTR PROGRAM)


 12) THE SOUTSEP PROGRAM HAS BEEN MODIFIED TO SENSE WHEN THE ACTIVE
     DISK DATASET IS FILLING UP. IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY START YOUR
     SAVEWTR (STARTED TASK) WHEN THE ACTIVE FILE REACHES 80% FULL.
     THIS SHOULD ELIMINATE MOST OF THE D37'S THAT OCCUR IN DISKWTR.


 13) THE SOUTWTR PROGRAM HAS BEEN MODIFIED TO HANDLE BOTH THE
     3420 (1600/6250 BPI)  AND THE NEW 3480 CARTRIDGE TAPE DRIVES.


 14) IF THE OPTIONAL "SPECLDEL" DD IS SUPPLIED, THE REQUESTED REPORTS
     WILL BE DELETED FROM THE JOURNAL FILE IN THE SAVEWTR AND CLEANWTR
     PROCESSING. A SPECIFIC JOBNAME AND JOB NUMBER CAN BE SPECIFIED, OR
     JUST A JOBNAME WITH NO NUMBER, OR A GENERIC JOBNAME (LAST CHAR IS *

     PROCS AFFECTED: SAVEWTR AND CLEANWTR

      NOTE: THE SPECIAL DELETE DATASET SHOULD BE  LRECL=80
            FORMAT OF THE FILE IS:
                          1         2         3
           COL   123456789012345678901234567890
                 JJJJJJJJ XXX#####             <== JOB# IS OPTIONAL)
                    ×      ×   ×-----JOB NUMBER
                    ×      ×---------JOB LIT  (IE: JOB STC TSU)
                    ×----------------JOB NAME (IE: PAYROLL
                                                   PAY*  <= GENERIC)











 THIS SECTION DESCRIBES SOME OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS TO CONSIDER
 BEFORE INSTALLING AND RUNNING THIS NEW VSAM SYSTEM.


 1) WHATEVER PREFIX THAT YOU CHOOSE FOR THE DISKWTR SYSTEM MUST
    BE UNIQUE TO THIS SYSTEM ONLY. (IE: SYS2.OPSWTR)
    THIS IS BECAUSE THE CLEANWTR/SOUTCLN PROGRAM USES THIS PREFIX
    TO DETERMINE THE EMPTY DAILY/ARCHIVE DATASETS. SOUTCLN INTERNALLY
    DOES A LISTSPC ON THAT PREFIX AND BUILDS A DATASET TABLE. AS IT
    WALKS THRU THE VSAM JOURNAL, IT KEEPS A COUNTER OF ALL THE VALID
    SYSOUT REPORTS ON EACH DATASET. AFTER THE WHOLE JOURNAL IS READ,
    IT THE LOOKS AT ALL THE DATASETS AND DYNAMICALLY DELETES ANY
    DATASET THAT IS DETERMINED TO BE EMPTY.
    (IE: IF YOU SELECT "SYS2.OPSWTR" AS THE PREFIX AND YOU UNLOAD
         THE PROGRAMS, PROCS, AND SPF PANELS TO A DATASET NAMED
         "SYS2.OPSWTR.ASM"; THE FIRST TIME CLEANWTR RUNS, IT WILL
         DELETE THIS DATASET BECAUSE IT DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY VALID
         SYSOUT REPORTS)



 2) IF YOU ARE CONVERTING FROM THE OLD SYSTEM TO THIS NEW VSAM VERSION,
    CHECK YOUR 'SYS1.PARMLIB(IEALPA00)' MEMBER. IF YOU WERE LPA'ING
    SOUTSEP AND SOUTCALL , YOU WILL NEED TO IPL BEFORE THE NEW PROGRAMS
    WILL TAKE EFFECT. YOU COULD BYPASS AN IPL BY STEPLIBING TO THE
    LINKLIST LIBRARY WHILE TESTING.



 3) THE LOCK DATASET IN THIS SYSTEM MUST BE YOUR PREFIX.
    IF YOU SELECT  "SYS2.OPSWTR" AS YOUR PREFIX, IN THE PROCS
    DISKWTR, SAVEWTR AND CLEANWTR THE PREFIX DD MUST BE:

    //PREFIX  DD DSN=SYS2.OPSWTR,DISP=...

     DO NOT USE THE OLD LOCK NAME HERE (IE: SYS2.OPSWTR.LOCK)
     THE PREFIX NAME MUST BE ONLY THE PREFIX THE WILL BE PUT ON
           PREFIX...DAILY.DXXXXXXX.TXXXXX
                    AND
           PREFIX...ARCHIVE.DXXXXXXX.TXXXXX



 4) IF YOU ARE IN A CONVERSION MODE, SET THE "OLDPFX" DD IN
    THE SAVEWTR AND CLEANWTR PROCS TO YOUR OLD PREFIX (INCLUDE "DATA")

    (IE: OLD SYSTEM DATASETS = SYS2.OPSTAPE.DATA.ARCHIVE.G1234V00)
     USE THE FOLLOWING:

    //OLDPFX  DD DSN=SYS2.OPSTAPE.DATA,DISP=...

    (NOTE: IN SAVEWTR, THIS IS ONLY REQUIRED IF YOU ARE REBUILDING)

     THE SAME HOLDS HERE AS FOR #4 ABOVE

     OLDPFX NAME MUST BE ONLY THE PREFIX THE WILL BE PUT ON
           OLDPFX...ARCHIVE.G0000V00



 5) THE MAXIMUM PREFIX FOR THIS SYSTEM CAN ONLY BE 21 CHARACTERS.
    THE OLD SYSTEM COULD HANDLE 25. THIS SYSTEM CAN STILL HANDLE
    A 25 CHARACTER OLD PREFIX IF YOU ARE IN A CONVERSION MODE.




 6) EVEN THOUGH DISKWTR CAN SENSE THAT THE ACTIVE FILE IS 80% FULL,
    IT MAY NOT ALWAY AVERT  D37'S.  SOUTSEP ONLY GETS CONTROL WHEN
    A NEW REPORT IS BEING WRITTEN BY THE EXTERNAL WTR. IF THE FILE
    IS, AS AN EXAMPLE,  75% FULL AND A 500,000 LINE REPORT IS PUT
    TO THE DISKWTR CLASS. SOUTSEP WRITES THE SEPERATOR RECORD AND
    INSERTS A RECORD INTO THE VSAM JOURNAL. IT THE SEES THAT THE
    ACTIVE FILE IS ONLY 75% FULL AND RETURNS CONTROL BACK TO THE
    THE EXTERNAL WRITTER. THE EXTERNAL WRITTER, WHILE OFFLOADING
    THE LARGE REPORT, WILL D37 THE ACTIVE FILE. THIS CANNOT BE
    AVOIDED UNLESS YOU SOME HOW ARE CONTROLLING LARGE REPORTS.

    NOTE: WHEN EXTERNAL WRITER CALLS THE SOUTSEP PROGRAM, THERE
          IS NO PLACE WHERE THE NUMBER OF LINES IS PASSED TO SOUTSEP.
          IF THERE WAS, WE COULD DO SOME CALCULATIONS WITH IT.
          BUT AS OF NOW, WE HAVE TO LIVE WITH OCCASIONAL D37'S OR
          DO NOT RELY ON THE 80% FULL TEST AND START YOUR OWN SAVEWTR
          THRU AUTO AT SPECIFIED TIME INTERVALS.




 7) SOUTSEP/SAVEWTR ASSUMES  THAT YOU ARE USING CATALOG CONTROL
    IN YOUR TAPE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM. (EXPDT=99000) IF YOU ARE NOT,
    YOU MAY HAVE TO MODIFY THE DYNAMIC ALLOCATION PARM IN THE
    SOUTWTR PROGRAM. LOOK FOR "TAPEXPDT" AND UNCOMMENT THE LINES
    BEFORE ASSEMBLING THE PROGRAM (THERE ARE 2 OCCURRANCES)
    THIS IS UNTESTED AS OF 7/30/84




 8) ALL LOGIC IN SOUTSEP FOR DIFFERENT RECORD FORMAT SYSOUTS HAS
    BEEN REMOVED. ONLY RECFM=FBA AND LRECL=133 IS SUPPORTED.
    THIS WAS BECAUSE THE SPF PROGRAM THAT PRINTED THE DATA
    USED ONLY RECFM=FBA,LRECL=133.




 9) ALL TTR CALCULATION LOGIC (IN SOUTSEP AND SOUTWTR) IS BASED ON
    THE DISK DATASETS BEING IN ONLY ONE EXTENT. IT IS IMPORTANT
    TO ALLOCATE YOUR "ACTIVE" FILE IN ONE CONTIGUOUS (CYL) EXTENT.
    THE SOUTWTR PROGRAM WILL ALLOCATE THE DAILY DISK FILES (IF YOU
    PUT DAILYS TO DISK) THE SAME SIZE AS THE  ACTIVE, BUT DOES NOT
    REQUEST CONTIGUOUS SPACE. IF CONTIGUOUS SPACE WAS NOT FOUND IN
    ALLOCATION, SOME INVALID TTR'S COULD BE CALCULATED. THE ONLY
    PROBLEM THAT WILL ARISE FROM THIS BAD TTR IS THAT WHEN YOU
    SELECT A SYSOUT REPORT  WITH THE BAD TTR, THE SOUTSUB PROGRAM
    WILL POSITIONED THE READ TO EARLY IN THE DAILY FILE. IT WILL
    THEN READ SEQUENTIALLY UNTIL THE REQUESTED REPORT IS FOUND.
    (IT SHOULD NEVER HAVE A TTR CALCULATED PAST THE REQUIRED POSITION)




 10) AS IN THE OLD SYSTEM, ALWAYS START DISKWTR THRU THE SAVEWTR
     STARTED TASK. NEVER START DISKWTR!!!!. IF YOU DO, DISKWTR
     WILL DESTROY ANY OLD DATA IN THE ACTIVE FILE.
     SAVEWTR OFFLOADS THE ACTIVE FILE AND RE-INITIALIZES IT; IT THEN
     STARTS DISKWTR. ALSO, AFTER ANY IPL, START SAVEWTR.




 11) IT IS RECOMMENDED TO PLACE  PROGRAMS "SOUTCALL" AND "SOUTSEP"
     INTO YOU IEALPA00 MEMBER IN SYS1.PARMLIB. THIS WILL ALLOW
     THE MVSGPSVC TO AUTHORIZE ALL USERS FOR TAPE MOUNTS THRU SOUTCALL.
     IT WILL ALSO ELIMINATE MULTIPLE LOADINGS OF SOUTSEP FOR EACH
     REPORT WRITTEN TO THE DISKWTR.




 12) IF THE OPTIONAL "SPECLDEL" DD IS SUPPLIED, THE REQUESTED REPORTS
     WILL BE DELETED FROM THE JOURNAL FILE IN THE SAVEWTR AND CLEANWTR
     PROCESSING. A SPECIFIC JOBNAME AND JOB NUMBER CAN BE SPECIFIED, OR
     JUST A JOBNAME WITH NO NUMBER, OR A GENERIC JOBNAME (LAST CHAR IS *

      NOTE: THE SPECIAL DELETE DATASET SHOULD BE  LRECL=80
            FORMAT OF THE FILE IS:
                          1         2         3

                 JJJJJJJJ XXX#####             <== JOB# IS OPTIONAL)
                    ×      ×   ×-----JOB NUMBER
                    ×      ×---------JOB LIT  (IE: JOB STC TSU)
                    ×----------------JOB NAME (IE: PAYROLL
                                                   PAY*  <= GENERIC)











*** SPECIAL DELETE REPORTS PROCESSING *****



THE SOUTSYS SYSTEM NOW PROVIDES A MEANS OF DELETING UNWANTED
REPORTS FROM THE SYSTEM. THIS MEMBER CONTAINS DOCUMENTATION FOR
THE USE OF THIS FEATURE.

NOTE: ALL REPORTS WILL ALWAYS BE ADDED TO THE ACTIVE FILE VIA
      THE EXTERNAL WRITER AND SOUTSEP EXIT.

A) A OPTIONAL DD CARD CAN BE ADDED TO THE "SAVEWTR" AND "CLEANWTR"
   PROCEDURES. IF THEY ARE NOT PRESENT, PROCESSING CONTINUES AS
   NORMAL WITH ALL JOBS/REPORTS BEING PLACED ON THE DAILY/ARCHIVE FILES.

B) IF THE "SAVEWTR" PROC CONTAINS THE "SPECLDEL" DD CARD, THE FOLLOWING
   WILL TAKE PLACE WHEN THE SAVEWTR RUNS:
     1) IF DAILY DISK FILES ARE BEING COPIED TO TAPE, AND A DELETE
        JOBNAME IS MATCHED; THE JOURNAL RECORD WILL BE DELETED AND
        THE REPORT WILL NOT BE PUT ON THE ARCHIVE FILE

     2) WHEN THE ACTIVE FILE IS COPIED TO A DAILY DISK OR TAPE AND A
        DELETE JOBNAME IS MATCHED; THE JOURNAL RECORD WILL BE DELETED
        AND THE REPORT WILL NOT BE PUT TO THE DAILY DATASET.

C) IF THE "CLEANWTR" PROC CONTAINS THE "SPECLDEL" DD CARD, THE FOLLOWING
   WILL TAKE PLACE WHEN THE CLEANWTR RUNS:
      1) NORMAL DELETE OF JOBS IF THE EXPIRATION DATE IS REACHED
      2) IF THE DATE HAS NOT EXPIRED, A COMPARE IS DONE OF JOBNAME
         AND THE SPECIAL DELETE DATASET; IF A MATCH IS FOUND, THE
         JOURNAL RECORD IS DELETED ONLY;

D) THE SPECIAL DELETE DATASET SHOULD BE  LRECL=80
  ===> THERE CAN BE A MAXIMUM OF 99 JOBS IN THIS DATASET
  ===> SAVEWTR WILL ABEND WITH A ABEND CODE 27 IF THERE ARE MORE?????

            FORMAT OF THE FILE IS:
                          1         2         3
           COL   123456789012345678901234567890
                 JJJJJJJJ XXX#####             <== JOB# IS OPTIONAL)
                    ×      ×   ×-----JOB NUMBER
                    ×      ×---------JOB LIT  (IE: JOB STC TSU)
                    ×----------------JOB NAME (IE: PAYROLL
                                                   PAY*  <= GENERIC)

     1) THE JOB NUMBER IS OPTIONAL - IF SUPPLIED, IT MUST BE THE FULL JO
        NUMBER.  (IE:  STC00123   JOB01999   TSU00020)

     2) THE JOB NAME IS REQUIRED - IT CAN BE A FULL 8 CHARACTER JOB NAME
        IT CAN BE A GENERIC NAME.  A GENERIC NAME CAONTAINS A * IN THE L
        CHARACTER. (IE:  PAY*  D*  TMS*)


E) VARIOUS USES FOLLOW;

   1) IF YOU USE A FLUSH OR PUSH JOB TO PUT DUMMY REPORTS TO THE ACTIVE
      FILE (TO FILL THE LAST BLOCK SO 4.S CAN LOOK AT THE MOST CUUENT JO
      THE SPECLDEL DATASET CAN CONTAIN THAT STARTED TASK NAME. THOSE
      JOBS WILL BE DELETED FROM THE JOURNAL AND WILL NOT BE COPIED TO
      THE DAILY FILES WHEN SAVEWTR RUNS.

   2) IF A JOB ACCIDENTALLY GETS PLACED ON THE DISKWTR SYSTEM; (IE: PAYR
      UPDATE THE SPECLDEL DATASET WITH THAT JOBNAME. WHEN THE COPY FROM
      THE ACTIVE TO DAILY TAKES PLACE, THAT JOB IS DELETED.

      IF THE COPY ALREADY TOOK PLACE, YOU CAN WAIT FOR THE COPY FROM DAI
      TO ARCHIVE TO TAKE PLACE AND THEN THE JOB WILL BE DELETED.
        OR
      YOU CAN RUN THE CLEANWTR JOB WITH THE SPECLDEL DD. THIS WILL DELET
      ONLY THE JOURNAL RECORD. (NOTE: IF THE JOURNAL RECORD IS NOT THERE
      YOU CAN'T GET THE DATA)

   3) THE REBUILD AND FIXTAPE OPTIONS HAVE BEEN MODIFIED ALSO.
      IE: IF YOU HAD RUN A SPECIAL CLEANWTR TO DELETE A JOB AND THE HAD
      TO RUN A THE FIXTAPE OPTION; WHEN THE SEPERATOR FOR A DELETED JOB
      IS FOUND, FIXTAPE WILL RE-ADD THE JOURNAL RECORD TO SYNC THE FILES
      IF THE SPECLDEL DD IS IN THE FIXTAPE JOB, THAT RECORD WILL NOT
      BE RE-ADDED.











*** WARNING FOR MISSING DATA ON ACTIVE FILE

   CODE HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE SOUTSUB PROGRAM TO WARN REQUESTORS THAT
   THE LAST BLOCK OF DATA HAS NOT BEEN WRITTEN TO THE ACTIVE FILE.

   ( THIS IS DUE TO THE BLOCKING OF ACTIVE FILE)


   1) IF PART OF THE REQUESTED REPORT IS ON THE ACTIVE FILE, AND THE RES
      IS CONTAINED ON THE LAST BLOCK, A WARNING IS ADDED TO THE REPORT
      STATING THAT ALL THE DATA IS NOT THERE.

   2) IF A SMALL REPORT (IE: LESS THAN 46 LINES IF ACTIVE IS BLOCKED 611
      IS REQUESTED, A ONE LINE WARNING IS ISSUED STATING THAT THE DATA
      IS NOT ON THE ACTIVE FILE YET.

   3) THIS CODE ALSO ELIMINATES THE SOUTSUB PROGRAM FROM READING THE
      ENTIRE ACTIVE FILE TO DETERMINE THAT THE SEPERATOR AND REPORT
      HAVE NOT BEEN WRITTEN YET. THE OUTPUT FROM A JOBNAME LIST USE TO
      APPEAR ON THE BROWSE SCREEN IF THIS CONDITION OCCURED.
