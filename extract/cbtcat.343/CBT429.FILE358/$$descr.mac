Hi Sam,

I don't know if you have been following IBM-Main lately, but there
has been a discussion on utilities for putting SYSLOG on tape, or
other means of keeping it around.  We have a public domain program
called SOUTSYS that I think some people could use.  I think it would
be a good candidate for the CBT tape.  I don't want to send SOUTSYS
to 20 different people who might request it, so I thought I could
send it to you and you could eventually put it on the CBT tape.

Here is a description from the install pds that gives a good
overview of the product.  We use it at Harnischfeger to keep all of
our message class output and SYSLOG.  We keep it online for 8 days,
and then it is archived to tape which we keep until it is 90 days
old.

Basically, the system uses an exit to the external writer to write
all sysout for the class chosen to a sequential disk file.  It keeps
track of where every file starts in a Vsam file, and when the  seq.
disk file is full, copies it to a different file on disk and
compresses it.  After a period of time set by the user, each
compressed seq. file is modded onto tape.  ISPF panels are used to
look at any sysout in the system.  Data on tape can be printed to
held output, or looked at online, except you have to wait for the
tape mount.
