//SAVEWTR  PROC PREFIX='SYS2.OPSWTR',     <== DSN PREFIX
//             MSGC=H
//*
//*     THIS IS THE STARTED SAVEWTR PROCEDURE.  ITS FUNCTION
//*     IS TO COPY THE 'ACTIVE' DISKWTR  DATASET TO A DAILY DATASET
//*     (EITHER ON TAPE OR ON DISK) AND ALSO UPDATE THE VSAM JOURNAL
//*     ACCORDINGLY. IF THERE ARE DAILY DISK DATASETS CREATED,
//*     SAVEWTR WILL ALSO MOVE OLD DAILY DISK DATASETS TO AN ARCHIVE
//*     TAPE BASED ON THE DAYS (OLD) PARAMETER PASSED TO THE SOUTWTR
//*     PROGRAM. A OUTPUT REPORT WILL BE CREATED VIA THE SOUTXIT
//*     ROUTINE ONLY WHEN THE ACTIVE FILE IS COPIED TO THE DAILY FILE.
//*
//*     IF THIS ROUTINE COMPLETES NORMALLY, THE DISKWTR 'LOCK'
//*     IS DELETED AND THE DISKWTR TASK IS RE-STARTED.
//*
//*     SAVEWTR WILL CREATE DISK AND TAPE DATASETS DYNAMICALLY
//*     AND WILL INCLUDE A DATE AND TIME STAMP IN THE DATASET NAME.
//*
//*     WHEN CREATING EITHER DAILY OR ARCHIVE TAPES, SAVEWTR WILL ONLY
//*     FILL APPROXIMATELY 2000 FT. ON A TAPE AND THEN CUT A NEW
//*     DATASET ON A NEW TAPE. THIS WILL ELIMINATE MULTI-REEL DATASETS.
//*
//*     THIS PROCEDURE SUPPORTS A LOCKING MECHANISM TO INSURE
//*     THAT THE 'DISKWTR' IS NOT STARTED MULTIPLE TIMES.
//*
//*
//* *** SELECT OR MODIFY A PARM BEFORE EXECUTING
//*
//*
//*   THE FOLLOWING INSURES THAT DISKWTR IS STOPPED
//*   AND FREES THE LOCK DATASET
