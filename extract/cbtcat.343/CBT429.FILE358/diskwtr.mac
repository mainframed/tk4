//DISKWTR  PROC PREFIX='SYS2.OPSWTR'
//*
//*        THIS IS THE STARTED DISKWTR PROCEDURE.  IT'S FUNCTION
//*        IS TO WRITE 'SYSOUT' (INCLUDING MSGCLASS) FOR A USER
//*        DEFINED CLASS TO A PREDEFINED 'ACTIVE SYSOUT' DATASET.
//*
//*        THIS IS DONE VIA THE JES2 EXTERNAL WRITER ROUTINE
//*        (STANDARD IN MVS) AND THE 'SOUTSEP' WRITER SEPARATOR
//*        ROUTINE.
//*
//*        NOTE: THE DATASET SUFFIXES 'ACTIVE' AND 'JOURNAL' MUST
//*              NOT BE CHANGED.  CHANGE ONLY THE PREFIX.
//*
//*
//*        THIS PROCEDURE SUPPORTS A LOCKING MECHANISM TO INSURE
//*        THAT THE 'DISKWTR' IS NOT STARTED BY THE OPERATOR.  IT
//*        SHOULD ONLY BE RE-STARTED BY THE 'SAVEWTR' PROC AND ONLY
//*        AFTER THE ACTIVE DATASET HAS BEEN COPIED TO THE DAILY FILES'
