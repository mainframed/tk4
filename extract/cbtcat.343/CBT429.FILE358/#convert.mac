 #CONVERT


 THIS MEMBER DESCRIBES MOST OF THE STEPS NEED FOR A CONVERSION
 FROM THE OLD SYSTEM TO THE NEW. IT IS NOT FULL PROOF AND SHOULD
 ONLY BE USED AS A GUIDE.

 (THIS ASSUMES THAT YOU HAVE GONE THRU SOME TYPE OF SYSTEM TESTING????)


 THERE ARE 2 OPTIONS FOR CONVERSION INCLUDED HERE:

OPTIONS #1 FOLLOWS:

 1) DECIDE IF YOU WILL BE USING THE SAME DATASET PREFIX,
    OR PICK A NEW PREFIX. THIS DECISSION WILL BE USED LATER.

    NOTE:THE NEW SYSTEM DOES NOT USE THE  "DATA"  AS PART OF THE
         DATASET NAMES. THEREFORE, IF YOU CHOOSE "SYS2.OPSWTR" AS
         YOUR PREFIX AND YOUR OLD SYSTEM USED "SYS2.OPSWTR.DATA";
         THIS IS CONSIDERED  A NEW PREFIX.

 2) STOP YOUR CURRENT DISKWTR SYSTEM.


 3) RUN YOUR SAVEWTR PROC

   * MAKE SURE IT DOES NOT RESTART DISKWTR *
   *****************************************


 4) IF YOU ARE CURRENTLY USING 2 PREFIXES
    (IE: SYS2.OPSWTR AND SYS2.OPSTAPE), IT IS RECOMMENDED TO RUN
    YOUR ARCHHIST PROCS TO COPY ALL THE DATA TO THE HISTORY TAPES.

    IF YOU ARE USING JUST ONE PREFIX AND YOU HAVE BOTH DAILY AND
    ARCHIVE TAPES, IT IS RECOMMENDED TO COPY ALL OF YOUR DAILYS
    TO THE ARCHIVE TAPES. (USE ARCHWTR)

    IF YOU ARE USING JUST ONE PREFIX AND YOU HAVE ONLY DAILY DATASETS
    ON TAPE, YOU DO NOT NEED TO COPY THEM.


 5) ASSEMBLE AND LINKEDIT ALL OF THE PROGRAMS INTO A LINKLIST LIBRARY.
    (INCLUDE THE CONVERT PROGRAM (SOUTCVT)

 6) ASSEMBLE AND LINKEDIT THE NEW CMNFS00 (4.S) SPF PROGRAM

 7) COPY/OVERLAY THE SPF PANELS AND THE SKELETON MEMBER

 8) COPY/OVERLAY THE NEW PROCS
    (CHECK YOUR "AUTO" FOR STARTUPS OF THE OLD SYSTEM)

 9) IPL IF YOU WERE MLPA'ING SOUTCALL AND SOUTSEP

10) DELETE YOUR OLD ACTIVE DATASETS.
    (BOTH &PREFIX..ACTIVE  AND  &PREFIX..DATA.ACTIVE)

11) CREATE A NEW ACTIVE FILE AND FORMAT IT (USE JOB FORMAT).
    MUST BE ON A CYLINDER BOUNDRY (USE CYL OR ROUND IN ALLOCATION).

12) CREATE THE NEW VSAM JOURNAL (USE JOB INITJRNL).
    ESTIMATE THE NUMBER OF RECORDS YOU WILL NEED AND UPDATE THE
    "RECORDS" IN THE DEFINE CLUSTER.


13) RUN THE CONVERSION PROGRAM  (USE JOB CONVERT).

    IMPORTANT: THE CONVERSION PROGRAM SUPPLIED COULD RUN A LONG
               TIME IF YOU ARE CONVERTING A LOT OF OLD JOURNALS.
               (SEE NOTE IN SOUTCVT PROGRAM).
               AT  G.E., WE KEEP 15 MONTHS ON DISKWTR. WE HAD TO
               CONVERT 60 GDG'S OF ARCHIVE JOURNAL (250,000 ENTRIES)
               THE CONVERSION RAN 4.5 HOURS, BUT THIS IS A ONE TIME
               PROCESS AND WILL NEVER BE NEEDED AGAIN.

    NOTE:      YOU HAVE 2 CHOICES FOR A PREFIX IN CONVERSION.

               1. YOU CAN USE THE SAME PREFIX (IE: "SYS2.OPSWTR.DATA")
                  IF YOU HAVE DAILY AND/OR ARCHIVE FILES, RUN THE
                  CONVERSION PROGRAM WITH "PARM=D" FOR DAILY FILES
                  AND "PARM=A" FOR ARCHIVE FILES.

               2. IF YOU WANT A NEW PREFIX (IE: "SYS2.OPSWTR"  ONLY)

                 A) YOU MUST COPY ALL OF YOUR DAILY FILES TO ARCHIVE
                    FILES AND THEN RUN THE CONVERSION PROGRAM WITH
                    "PARM=O"

                 B) IF YOU HAVE ONLY DAILY FILES AND DO NOT WANT TO
                    COPY ALL OF THE FILES TO ARCHIVE FILES, RUN  THE
                    CONVERSION PROGRAM WITH "PARM=O"; AND YOU MUST MAKE
                    FOLLOWING CHANGES TO TO THESE PROGRAMS BEFORE
                    ASSEMBLING:

                       CMNFS00@ - FIND '#####' (2 OCCURENCES)
                                  DELETE LINE "OLD=ARCHIVES" LINES
                                  UN-COMMENT  "OLD=DAILY" LINES

                       SOUTCLN  - FIND '#####'  (10 OCCURENCES)
                                  DELETE LINE "OLD=ARCHIVES" LINES
                                  UN-COMMENT  "OLD=DAILY" LINES

                       SOUTSUB  - FIND '#####'  (2 OCCURENCES)
                                  DELETE LINE "OLD=ARCHIVES" LINES
                                  UN-COMMENT  "OLD=DAILY" LINES

                       SOUTWTR  - FIND '#####'  (2 OCCURENCES)
                                  DELETE LINE "OLD=ARCHIVES" LINES
                                  UN-COMMENT  "OLD=DAILY" LINES


    A) IF YOU PUT ALL YOUR OLD DATA TO A SECOND PREFIX, OR YOU ARE
       SELECTING A NEW PREFIX (NOT USING "DATA" AS PART OF THE NAME;
       USE "PARM=O" AND CHANGE THE  //INPUT  DD   TO POINT TO THE
       OLD JOURNAL DATASETS.

    B) IF YOU ARE USING THE SAME PREFIX AS BEFORE,
       (IE: SYS2.OPSWTR.DATA  <===  NOTE : STILL USING DATA IN NAME)
       AND YOU PUT ALL OF THE DATA INTO THE ARCHIVE FILE, USE "PARM=R"
       AND POINT THE  //INPUT DD  TO YOUR ARCHIVE JOURNAL DATASETS

    C) IF YOU ARE USING THE SAME PREFIX AS BEFORE,
       (IE: SYS2.OPSWTR.DATA  <===  NOTE : STILL USING DATA IN NAME)
       AND YOU HAVE ONLY DAILY DATASETS, USE "PARM=D" AND POINT THE
       //INPUT DD  TO YOUR DAILY JOURNAL DATASETS.

    D) IF YOU SELECTED A NEW PREFIX, ALL OF YOUR OLD DATA MUST HAVE
       BEEN COPIED TO EITHER THE DAILY OR ARCHIVE DATASETS. YOU
       CAN ONLY SELECT ONE OR THE OTHER. USE "PARM=O' AND POINT THE
       //INPUT DD  TO YOUR DAILY OR ARCHIVE JOURNAL DATASETS.

  NOTE: ONLY USE THE "PARM=O" IF YOU WRE USING 2 PREFIXES WITH THE
        OLD SYSTEM OR IF YOU  CHOOSE A NEW PREFIX .
        (NOTE: IF YOUR OLD SYSTEM USED "SYS2.OPSWTR.DATA"  AND
               YOU NOW WANT TO ONLY USE "SYS2.OPSWTR" AS THE PREFIX,
               THIS IS CONSIDERED A NEW PREFIX)
        WHEN THE SOUTSUB PROGRAM SEES THE "O" IT WILL BUILD THE
        DATASET NAME USING THE OLD PREFIX (SEE CMNFSWTO IN PANEL
        CMNFS00) AND TACK ON "ARCHIVE" ALONG WITH A GDG NUMBER.
                (IE: SYS2.OLDPREFIX.ARCHIVE.G0000V00)
        WHEN THE SOUTSUB PROGRAM SEES A "A" OR 'D" OR "R" IT WILL
        USE THE NEW OR SAME PREFIX (SEE CMNFSWTR IN PANEL CMNFS00)
        AND TACK ON "ACTIVE/DAILY/ARCHIVE" DEPENDING ON THE LETTER.
        ALSO, DEPENDING ON THE DATE/TIME STAMP, IT WILL EITHER BUILD
        A OLD GDG NUMBER OR A NEW DATE/TIME STAMP.

  NOTE: IT WAS RECOMMENDED TO PLACE ALL OF YOU DATA INTO ONE TYPE,
        BUT IT IS NOT REQUIRED. YOU COULD USE ANY ONE OR MORE
        OF THE ABOVE PROCEDUCES FOR THE CONVERSION.
        AS AN EXAMPLE, IF YOU ARE USING 2 PREFIXES NOW, YOU COULD
        RUN THE CONVERSION PROGRAM WITH "PARM=O" AND INPUT POINTED
        TO YOUR SECOND PREFIX'S JOURNALS, THEN RUN THE CONVERSION
        PROGRAM WITH "PARM=R" AND INPUT POINTED TO YOUR FIRST PREFIX'S
        ARCHIVE JOURNALS AND THEN RUN THE CONVERSION PROGRAM WITH
        "PARM=D" AND INPUT POINTED TO YOUR FIRST PREFIX'S DAILY
        JOURNALS. YOU THEN HAVE TO USE YOUR FIRST PREFIX AS THE
        PREFIX FOR THIS NEW SYSTEM.

       SAMPLE DATASET TYPES EXAMPLES:

           OLD SYSTEM:  SYS2.OPSWTR.DATA.ACTIVE
                        SYS2.OPSWTR.ACTIVE <==JOURNAL
                        SYS2.OPSWTR.DATA.DAILY.G0000V00
                        SYS2.OPSWTR.DAILY.G0000V00   <==JOURNAL
                        SYS2.OPSWTR.DATA.ARCHIVE.G0000V00
                        SYS2.OPSWTR.ARCHIVE.G0000V00 <==JOURNAL
                        SYS2.OPSTAPE.DATA.ARCHIVE.G0000V00
                        SYS2.OPSTAPE.ARCHIVE.G0000V00 <==JOURNAL

           NEW SYSTEM:  SYS2.OPSWTR.JOURNAL   <== VSAM JOURNAL
                        SYS2.OPSWTR.ACTIVE
                        SYS2.OPSWTR.DAILY.D1840721.T1215
                        SYS2.OPSWTR.ARCHIVE.D1840725.T0230


      NOTE: AS YOU CAN SEE, YOU COULD STILL KEEP THE SAME PREFIX NAME.


14) YOU COULD NOW DELETE ALL THE OLD JOURNALS AND CLEANUP THE
    GDG ENTRIES IN THE CATALOG. DO NOT DELETE ANY OF YOU SYSOUT
    TAPE ENTRIES.


15) START DISKWTR.  WHEN THE ACTIVE FILE REACHES 80% FULL, IT WILL
    START SAVEWTR. SAVEWTR WILL RE-START DISKWTR.


16) IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT ONCE A WEEK, START CLEANWTR. THIS WILL
    STOP DISKWTR,  CLEAN UP THE VSAM JOURNAL AND ANY EMPTY DATASETS
    AND WILL START SAVEWTR WHICH WILL RE-START DISKWTR.


********************************************************************
*
*  AN ALTERNATE CONVERSION PROCESS TO THE ABOVE IS DESCRIBED BELOW
*
*  THIS PROCESS IS ONLY RECOMMENDED IF YOU ONLY KEEP SMALL AMOUNTS
*  OF DATA ON YOUR OLD DISKWTR SYSTEM (IE: 2-4 WEEKS ON DAILY TAPES)
*
********************************************************************



OPTIONS #2 FOLLOWS:

 1) DECIDE IF YOU WILL BE USING THE SAME DATASET PREFIX,
    OR PICK A NEW PREFIX. THIS DECISSION WILL BE USED LATER.

    NOTE:THE NEW SYSTEM DOES NOT USE THE  "DATA"  AS PART OF THE
         DATASET NAMES


 2) STOP YOUR CURRENT DISKWTR SYSTEM.


 3) RUN YOUR SAVEWTR PROC TO COPY THE ACTIVE TO YOUR DAILY TAPES
   *****************************************
   * MAKE SURE IT DOES NOT RESTART DISKWTR *
   *****************************************


 4) ASSEMBLE AND LINKEDIT ALL OF THE PROGRAMS INTO A LINKLIST LIBRARY.
    (INCLUDE THE CONVERT PROGRAM (SOUTCVT)

 5) ASSEMBLE AND LINKEDIT THE NEW CMNFS00 (4.S) SPF PROGRAM

 6) COPY/OVERLAY THE SPF PANELS AND THE SKELETON MEMBER

 7) COPY/OVERLAY THE NEW PROCS
    (CHECK YOUR "AUTO" FOR STARTUPS OF THE OLD SYSTEM)

 8) IPL IF YOU WERE MLPA'ING SOUTCALL AND SOUTSEP

 9) DELETE YOUR OLD ACTIVE DATASETS.
    (BOTH &PREFIX..ACTIVE  AND  &PREFIX..DATA.ACTIVE)

10) CREATE A NEW ACTIVE FILE AND FORMAT IT (USE JOB FORMAT).
    MUST BE ON A CYLINDER BOUNDRY (USE CYL OR ROUND IN ALLOCATION).

11) CREATE THE NEW VSAM JOURNAL (USE JOB INITJRNL).
    ESTIMATE THE NUMBER OF RECORDS YOU WILL NEED AND UPDATE THE
    "RECORDS" IN THE DEFINE CLUSTER.


12) RUN THE NEW SOUTWTR PROGRAM

    A)  USE  "PARM=FIXTAPE"
    B)  SELECT IF YOU WANT "OUTPUT=DAILY" OR "OUTPUT=ARCHIVE"
        (YOUR SELECTION WILL CREATE EITHER DAILY OR ARCHIVE TAPES)
    C)  POINT "//INPUT DD"  TO YOUR DAILY TAPES
    D)  SET //PREFIX TO YOUR SELECTED PREFIX


    THIS PROCESS WILL READ ALL OF YOUR DAILY TAPES, COMPRESS THE
    DATA AND PLACE IT ON A NEW DAILY OR ARCHIVE TAPE. THE VSAM
    JOURNAL WILL ALSO BE CREATED.



13) YOU COULD NOW DELETE ALL THE OLD JOURNALS AND SYSOUT DATASETS.


14) START DISKWTR.  WHEN THE ACTIVE FILE REACHES 80% FULL, IT WILL
    START SAVEWTR. SAVEWTR WILL RE-START DISKWTR.


15) IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT ONCE A WEEK, START CLEANWTR. THIS WILL
    STOP DISKWTR,  CLEAN UP THE VSAM JOURNAL AND ANY EMPTY DATASETS
    AND WILL START SAVEWTR WHICH WILL RE-START DISKWTR.
