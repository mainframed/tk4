 6.  The program uses GTE Laboratories macros for dynamic
     allocation.  Documentation is in macro GTEDADOC.  All
     features used by NEWSPACE have been tested and found okay.
     However, GTE Laboratories has not completed testing other
     features which are not used by NEWSPACE. Not all features
     have been included yet, and not all of those which have been
     included have been tested.  If you use these macros for
     other applications, please let GTE Laboratories know of any
     bugs...  especially the ones you have corrected!
