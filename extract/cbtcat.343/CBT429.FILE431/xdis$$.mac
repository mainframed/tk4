You were at the latest SHARE, weren't you?

Did you happen to catch any talks about the assembler or the
disassembler?  Somehow the topic of disassemblers came up on the ASM370
list (I still call it that), and no less than John Erhman asked me
about mine.  So I'd like to know what, if anything, was said at SHARE
about disassemblers.

It also occurs to me that somehow my XDIS got lost in all the moving
things over from various dying FTP sites to the CBT tape.  I suppose I
should try to get it on there, but there are already two disassemblers
there, and it seems that at least one of them may have borrowed heavily
from mine.
