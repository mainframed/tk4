     DEFAULTS -- CLASS(A), COPIES(1), NOHOLD, LIST, PRINT, NOFOLD

))COPIES('NNN') - NUMBER OF COPIES TO BE PRINTED.
            DEFAULT IS 1.
))DEST('USERID') - REMOTE USER TO WHICH SYSOUT DATA SETS
            ARE TO BE ROUTED.
))HOLD      - OUTPUT IS TO BE PLACED ON A HOLD QUEUE UPON

))NOHOLD    - OUTPUT IS NOT TO BE PLACED ON A HOLD QUEUE

))VOLUME('VOLSER') - VOLUME SERIAL OF VOLUME ON WHICH DATA SETS
