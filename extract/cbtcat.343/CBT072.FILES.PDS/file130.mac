    CUTLOCUS  IS A COMMAND PROCESSOR (CP) WHICH HAS AS ALIAS NAMES NINE
 OTHER  COMMAND  PROCESSORS. IT PROVIDES MANY OF THE IEHPROGM FUNCTIONS
 TO THE TSO USER. THE ALIAS NAMES OF CUTLOCUS ARE:

                BLDG.......BUILD GDG INDEX LEVELS
                BLDX.......BUILD INDEX LEVELS
                CATLG......CATALOG DATASETS
                CONNECT....CONNECT CATALOGS
                DLTX.......DELETE INDEX LEVELS
                FIND.......LOCATE AND DESCRIBE DATASETS
                PURGE......SCRATCH AND OPTIONALLY, UNCATALOG D
                RELEASE....RELEASE CATALOGS
                UNCATLG....UNCATALOG DATASETS

    THE GENERAL FORMAT OF THE INDIVIDUAL CUTLOCUS COMMAND PROCESSORS IS
 AS FOLLOWS:

      CMDNAME (DSLIST/INDEXLIST)  VOL(VOLID  TYPE   QUALIFIER )
                 CVOL(VOLID  TYPE )   SPECIAL KEYWORDS

      WHERE:

           DSLIST IS ONE OR MORE DATASET NAMES ENCLOSED IN PARENTHESES.
                IF  ONLY  ONE  DSNAME  IS GIVEN, THE PARENTHESES MAY BE
                OMITTED.

           INDEXLIST  IS  ONE OR MORE INDEX NAMES, EITHER MULTILEVEL OR
                SINGLE  LEVEL ENCLOSED IN PARENTHESES. IF ONLY ONE, THE
                PARENTHESES MAY BE OMITTED.

           VOLID IS THE 1 TO 6 ALPHANUMERIC SERIAL NUMBER OF A VOLUME.

           TYPE IS THE 4 DIGIT TYPE OF VOLID. IF NOT GIVEN, 2314 IS THE
                DEFAULT.

           QUALIFIER  IS  THE 1 DIGIT QUALIFIER FOR TYPE. THIS WOULD BE
                USED FOR 2400 OR 2305 UNIT TYPES.

           SPECIAL  KEYWORDS  ARE  THOSE ADDITIONAL KEYWORDS, EXPLAINED
                BELOW,  WHICH ARE APPLICABLE TO CERTAIN OF THE CUTLOCUS
                CP'S.

    EACH   OF  THE  COMMAND  PROCESSORS  COMPRISING  CUTLOCUS  WILL  BE
 DESCRIBED INDIVIDUALLY BELOW.

      SYSRES CATALOG AS THE START OF THE CATALOG SEARCH.

    2. BLDG (INDEXLIST) CVOL(VOLID)  SPECIAL KEYWORDS

      THIS  TELLS  BLDG TO BUILD THE GDG INDICES OF INDEXLIST USING THE
      VOLID OF THE CVOL KEYWORD AS THE START OF THE CATALOG SEARCH.

 B. BLDG HAS THREE SPECIAL KEYWORDS - NUM, DELETE, EMPTY

    1. NUM(NUMBER-TO-KEEP)

      THIS  IS  THE  NUMBER  OF  GDG  DATASETS  THAT  ARE  TO  BE KEPT.
      NUMBER-TO-KEEP  IS A 1 TO 3 DIGIT NUMBER IN THE RANGE 1 THRU 255.
      THE DEFAULT IS 1.

    2. DELETE

      THIS  KEYWORD  SETS  THE DELETE FLAG IN THE GDG INDEX. THIS TELLS
      CATALOG  MANAGEMENT  THAT  WHEN NUMBER-TO-KEEP IS EXCEEDED DELETE
      AND  UNCATALOG  THE  OLDEST  DATASET  IN  THE  GDG GROUP; IE, THE
      DATASET WITH THE LOWEST GENERATION NUMBER.

    3. EMPTY

      THIS  SETS  THE  EMPTY  FLAG IN THE GDG INDEX. THIS TELLS CATALOG
      MANAGEMENT  THAT  WHEN  NUMBER-TO-KEEP  IS  EXCEEDED,  DELETE AND
      UNCATALOG ALL PREVIOUS DATASETS IN THE GDG GROUP.

 C. NOTE:

   BLDG WILL BUILD ALL MISSING INDICES IF ANY ONE INDEX IN INDEXLIST IS
   A MULTILEVEL INDEX AND SOME OF ITS INDICES DO NOT EXIST.

      THIS  TELLS CATLG TO CATALOG THE DATASETS IN DSLIST TO THE VOLID,
      TYPE  AND  QUALIFIER  GIVEN  IN  THE VOL KEYWORD, USING THE VOLID
      GIVEN IN THE CVOL KEYWORD AS THE START OF THE CATALOG SEARCH.

 B. NOTE:

    AS  CATLG  USES THE CATBX FUNCTION OF CATALOG MANAGEMENT, ALL INDEX
    LEVELS  WHICH  DO  NOT  EXIST  WILL  BE  AUTOMATICALLY BUILT BY THE
    CATALOG MANAGEMENT ROUTINES.

    2. FIND (DSLIST) CVOL(VOLID)  SPECIAL KEYWORDS

      THIS TELLS FIND TO DO A CATALOG SEARCH, USING THE VOLID SPECIFIED
      IN THE CVOL KEYWORD, AND THEN PROCEED AS IN 1.

    3. FIND (DSLIST) VOL(PARMS)  SPECIAL KEYWORDS

      VOL KEYWORD; IE, NO CATALOG SEARCH IS TO BE DONE.

 B. FIND HAS TWO SPECIAL KEYWORDS - FLDS AND LIST

    1. FLDS

      THIS TELLS FIND TO LIST THE TYPE AND VOLID(S) DSLIST IS CATALOGED
      TO  (IF  THE  VOL KEYWORD IS NOT SPECIFIED), AND THEN TO LIST THE

 PURGE

 A. PURGE HAS THREE FORMS:

    1. PURGE (DSLIST)

      THIS  TELLS  PURGE  TO  SCRATCH  AND  UNCATALOG THE DATASET(S) OF
      DSLIST  USING  THE  SYSTEM  CATALOG  AS  THE START OF THE CATALOG
      SEARCH.

    2. PURGE (DSLIST) CVOL(VOLID)

      THIS  TELLS  PURGE  TO  SCRATCH  AND  UNCATALOG THE DATASET(S) OF
      DSLIST  USING  THE  VOLID OF THE CVOL KEYWORD AS THE START OF THE
      CATALOG SEARCH.

    3. PURGE (DSLIST) VOL(PARMS)

      THIS TELLS PURGE TO SCRATCH THE DATASET(S) OF DSLIST WHICH ARE ON
      THE  VOLID AND TYPE GIVEN BY THE VOL KEYWORD. THE DATASET(S) NEED
      NOT BE CATALOGED, AND NO UNCATALOGING WILL BE DONE.

 B. NOTE:

    1.  SINCE PURGE USES THE UCATDX FUNCTION OF CATALOG MANAGEMENT, ALL
       UNUSED   INDEX   LEVELS   EXCEPT   THE  FIRST  WILL  BE  DELETED
       AUTOMATICALLY  BY  CATALOG  MANAGEMENT.  IF THE DATASET NAME HAS
       ONLY ONE LEVEL (IE, NO INDEX LEVELS), IT WILL BE UNCATALOGED.

    2.  IF  THE  SCRATCHING OF A DATASET FAILS, THE DATASET WILL NOT BE
       UNCATALOGED BY PURGE.
