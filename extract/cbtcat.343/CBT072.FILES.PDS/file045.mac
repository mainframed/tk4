 PROGRAM NAME       PTFLST (EITHER PL/I F OR ANY PL/1 PROGRAM PRODUCT)

 PURPOSE            TO PRODUCE COVER LETTERS FROM STANDARD
                    SMP TAPES

 ABSTRACT           THIS PROGRAM, WRITTEN IN PL/1, IS DESIGNED
                    TO LIST THAT FILE OF A STANDARD SMP TAPE
                    (USUALLY FILE 2 OR 4) WHICH CONTAINS DOCUMENTATION
                    ABOUT THE PTF'S ON TAPE. THE PROGRAM WILL
                    PRODUCE A LISTING OF THE PTF'S IN THE OLD,
                    'COVER LETTER' FORMAT, ONE PTF PER PAGE WITH
                    AN IDENTIFICATION IN THE HEADER PORTION OF EACH PTF
                    OF THE TAPE ON WHICH THE PTF WAS CONTAINED. THE
                    TAPE IDENTIFICATION IS ENTERED VIA A CONSOLE ENTRY

 PROGRAM NAME       SMPXREF (REQUIRES PL/1 OPTIMIZING COMPILER)

 PURPOSE            TO PRODUCE THREE LISTINGS OF THE SMP FILE WITH
                    A CROSS REFERENCE LISTING BETWEEN MODULES AND
                    PTF'S.

 ABSTRACT           THE THREE LISTINGS PRODUCED BY THIS PL/1 PROGRAM ARE

                    1) THE STANDARD SMP LIST WHICH IS SEQUENCED
                       BY PTF NUMBER AND LISTS THE MODULES HIT
                       BY EACH PTF.

                    2) THE SAME SMP LIST, BUT THIS TIME SEQUENCED
                       BY DATE AND PTF WITHIN DATE. THE DATE
                       SORT IS IN DESCENDING SEQUENCE AND MAKES
                       IT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE LATEST PTF'S
                       APPLIED TO THIS SYSTEM.

                    3) A CROSS REFERENCE LISTING OF PTF'S BY MODULE.
                       THE LIST IS SORTED BY MODULES HIT BY A PTF,
                       AND THEN A LIST OF WHICH PTF'S WERE APPLIED
                       TO WHICH MODULE.

                             RUN INSTRUCTIONS



 THE SMP PROGRAMS CONTAIN SAMPLE JCL AND LIBERAL COMMENTS
 THROUGHOUT THE SOURCE DECKS TO ASSIST IN INSTALLING AND USING
 THE PROGRAMS. BELOW IS A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FUNCTIONS
 OF ALL FILES USED BY THE TWO PROGRAMS, AND ANY NECESSARY
 RUN INSTRUCTIONS.

 PTFLST

 THIS PROGRAM CAN BE INSTALLED USING ANY PL/1 COMPILER, I.E.
 THE F COMPILER OR ANY PROGRAM PRODUCT. IT REQUIRES ONLY
 ONE OPERATOR INTERVENTION IN RESPONSE TO THE MESSAGE.
        ENTER PTF TAPE NUMBER...XXXX
 THE OPERATOR NEED ONLY ENTER THE NUMBER OF THE PTF TAPE BEING
 LISTED (E.G., 7509). THE RESULTING ENTRY WILL BE USED TO
 IDENTIFY EACH PTF IN THE LISTING WITH THIS PTF TAPE, VIA
 A COMMENT IN THE HEADER PORTION.

 THERE IS ONLY ONE FILE, THE INPUT TAPE FILE, IN1. BE SURE
 TO INDICATE IN THE LABEL PARAMETER OF THE JCL WHICH FILE
 CONTAINS THE PTF COVER LETTERS.
 THE OUTPUT WILL APPEAR ON SYSPRINT.

 SMPXREF

 THIS PROGRAM MUST BE COMPILED USING THE PL/1 OPTIMIZING COMPILER
 (5734-PL2) PROGRAM PRODUCT. IT CONTAINS THREE (3)
 INTERNAL SORTS WHICH MAY REQUIRE MODIFICATION IF A SORT OTHER
 THAN 5740-SM1 IS TO BE USED.

 IN PREPARING TO RUN THIS PROGRAM THE IBM SMP PROGRAM MUST FIRST
 BE EXECUTED. USING THE 'LIST PTF' FUNCTION AND DIRECTING THE OUTPUT
 FILE THUS CREATED TO EITHER A TAPE OR DISK. THIS
 THEN BECOMES THE INPUT FILE USED BY SMPXREF TO GIVE THE THREE
 LISTINGS. THIS FILE CREATION RUN IS THE LONGEST PART OF
 THE ENTIRE JOB, AND MAY LAST FOR AN HOUR OR MORE. EACH ACCOUNT
 SHOULD HAVE A FAIRLY GOOD IDEA OF HOW LONG IT TAKES TO RUN
 SMP LIST PTF AT THEIR LOCATION. THE SMPXREF PROGRAM WILL
 NORMALLY ONLY REQUIRED 5-10 MINUTES TO EXECUTE.

 THE FILES USED ARE

     LISTPTF       THIS IS THE LIST FILE CREATED BY THE EXECUTION
                   OF THE SMP 'LIST PTF' FUNCTION. YOU CAN CREATE
                   IT ON EITHER TAPE OR DISK.

     SYS2          LIST OF THE PTF LIST FILE IN DATE SEQUENCE
     SYS           THE STANDARD SMP LIST PTF, BY PTF NUMBER
     OTP           LIST OF THE PTFS SEQUENCED BY MODULE
     PORT...
     SORT          ARE ALL USED BY THE INTERNAL SORTS
     TORT          THERE ARE THREE INTERNAL SORTS DOCUMENTED
                     IN THE SOURCE DECK OR SOURCE LISTING
