°METHODOLOGY
°
°Primary credit for the methodology in this section is due to
°Scott Loftesness, IBM, who presented much of the material at
°SHARE XLVI in San Francisco. That material was expanded upon by
°the MVS Tuning Committee at the Interim SHARE in Phoenix. It has
°been further expanded to include additional information relevant
°to MVS with the supervisor I, II and scheduler selectable units
°installed.

°The format of the methodology described in this report is divided
°into several sections. The first section consists of a HIPO
°diagram of MVS and a discussion of what MVS can and cannot do.
°This is followed by lists of those items that can be tuned in
°MVS. These lists are by order of importance and by ease of
°change.

°This is followed by those parameters that will need to be
°measured to tune MVS. The tools available to measure the
°parameters of MVS are described in this report under the 'TOOLS'
°section. Like any craft the tool used is up to the installation
°and should be selected based on the desired results, (A
°micrometer and a ruler can both measure length but the result may
°be significantly different), next are some parameters that can be
°calculated from measured information to further determine tuning
°strategies and performance bottlenecks. Finally there is included
°a list of magic values that offer guidelines for determining good
°and bad performance for various areas of the system. These values
°have held up over time and appear to be invariant to changes made
°by various selectable units.

°With the above information the actual methodology is then
°outlined. The approach should be to select those areas that are
°applicable to your installation based on each tuneable area and
°determine if you are receiving maximum performance.

°Remember:

°          An abnormal situation at one installation may be the
°           norm at another site. Only where a quasi-standard for
°           MVS exists will an attempt be made to give a judgment.
°           As with most aspects of systems programming, intuition
°           is a most valuable asset.

°          A tuning methodology once executed is not a permanent
°           solution. The methodology must be repeated
°           periodically to compensate for workload changes. The
°           methodology should also be revised as the system
°           changes and as knowledge and experience increases.

°1.   What can MVS do?

°     MVS can be a response oriented system and it can be a
°     thruput oriented system. To be both at one time will require
°     excess capacity or compromises. Response implies
°     availability of a resource upon demand (terminal input),
°     while thruput implies maximum utilization of all resources.

°     Therefore, before any tuning can begin you should be able to
°     answer the following questions:

°           What type of system do I have? Response? Thruput?

°           If a response system, what constitutes acceptable
°           response for your environment for trivial commands,
°           complex commands, and an average for all commands?

°           If a thruput oriented system, what is considered good
°           and bad turnaround for the major classes of work you
°           run?

°           If a thruput oriented system, how are you measuring
°           thruput to give an accurate picture of system thruput
°           versus operator thruput, or external interaction?

°a.   CPU Utilization
°
°CPU high
°
°Is your CPU utilization high? A value greater than 85% is normal,
°but one should be concerned if this value is achieved and the
°system is unproductive. A value of less than 85% indicates
°insufficient workload or severe hardware/software problems. A
°constant 100% CPU utilization and multiprogramming levels below
°the minimum level required to meet your performance objectives
°may require and upgrade to a more powerful CPU.

°Is Supervisor overhead high?

°Measure by a hardware monitor, or an approximation can be
°obtained by subtracting total SMF job step time from total CPU
°time obtained from MF1.

°A normal percentage is in the 70% range and values as high as 80%
°have been observed for a heavy TSO workload. For non-TSO a range
°of 50-70% is normal.

°Supervisor Overhead can be reduced by:
°
°          Add reentrant code to PLPA (SYS1.LPALIB).
°          Use fix lists.
°          Use BLDL (fixed) list to reduce I/O requirements.
°          Increase I/O blocking for frequently used data sets.
°          Convert VIO to non VIO to trade CPU time for I/O time.
°          Find dominant workload and optimize. (Use MF1
°           performance groups to monitor service used by class of
°           users.  Use SMF or address space monitors to locate
°           jobs).
°          Redesign and optimize programs as in MVT and SVS to be
°           aware of the environment they are running in.
°          Use repack programs to reduce page faults.
°          If supervisor time is high (greater than 70%) check
°           the swapping rates as a possible cause.
°          If swapping is low profile other supervisor services
°           see the section on Profile Service.

°CPU low - Greater than 10% wait

°          If real storage is critical:
°               Decrease fixed requirements.
°               Decrease multiprogramming level in IPS.
°               Increase amount of real storage.
°          Check channels and control unit activity for delays
°           caused by I/O.
°          Check paging and swapping activity.

°b.   Swapping

°Is swapping high? A value of less than 1.1 swaps per transaction
°ended is good.

°If attempts to reduce swapping have not solved the problem try a
°faster swapping device or try swap data sets. If this fails
°consider additional storage.

°Check the data set placement of swap and page data sets to reduce
°I/O delay time caused by arm movement.

°Is the count of long waits high?

°          Reduce use of STIMER.
°          Increase the ENQ residency value to reduce the
°           contention on ENQed resources.
°          Reschedule work to avoid waiting for resources.
°          Change the program issuing waits.
°
°Determine type of swap
°
°1.   Real storage swaps can be reduced by:
°
°          Increasing the amount of real storage.
°          Decreasing the fixed requirements of the system. This
°           can be accomplished by reducing the number or size of
°           TP buffers, fixed resident modules, or fixed BLDL.
°          Decrease the multiprogramming level in the IPS.

°2.   Exchange swaps can be reduced by:

°          IPS variations to deliver more service while in
°           storage.
°          Make a high swapping application non-swappable in the
°           PPT.

°3.   Unilateral swaps can be reduced by increasing the
°     multiprogramming level in the IPS.

°4.   Auxilary storage swaps can be reduced by:

°          Increasing auxilarly storage.
°          Decreasing multiprogramming level in the IPS.

°5.   ENQ exchange swaps can be reduced by:

°     -     Increasing the ENQ residency value (ERV).
°          Scheduling jobs that require the same resource at
°           different times.
°          Change the resources or the program to avoid
°           contention or serialization for a single resource.
°          Change JCL to use FREE=CLOSE.

°c.   Paging

°Is total paging rate high?

°     A value of 15 pages/second is reasonable for 3330's and 25
°     pages/sec for a 2305-2. Extreme variability with good
°     performance have been ovserved.

°Is pageable linkpack area paging high?  A rate of 12 to 15
°pages/second indicate a problem.
°
°          Improve IEAPAK00 (see tools).
°          Move nonshared code from PLPA to LNKLSTxx (eg VTAM).
°          Consider splitting PLPA across channels.
°
°Is CSA paging high?  A count of LPA/CSA page out of greater than
°5 pages/second indicates a problem.

°          Eliminate the use of duplex link pack area.
°          Don't default MAXUSERS.
°          Check expansion of SQA into CSA and correct.
°
°Is VIO paging high?

°          Set maximum BLKSIZE equal to 3 pages for a 3330 paging
°           device.
°          A low reclaim rate is an indication of missuse (e.g.,
°           SORT).
°          Reduce VIO BLKSIZE.
°          ZAP default BUFNO = 1 for VIO.
°          Change simulated device (3330 to 2314) to optimize the
°           window size for the paging device being used.

°Is demand paging high?
°
°          Run non-swappable jobs priviledged.
°          Reduce use of Virtual = Real.
°          Consider adding more real storage.
°          Move reentrant modules to LPA.
°          Decrease Multiprogramming level.
°          Reorder CSECTs based on page fault reference patterns.

°d.   Profile Service

°Determine the type of service being used - SRB, Task or
°Supervisor.

°High SRB usage - examine data management being used.

°Low SRB usage, high task or supervisor time.

°          Change application program if excessive supervisor
°           services are used.
°          Consider a faster CPU if task time is high and work is
°           not being completed.
°          Investigate operating system areas of greatest use and
°           determine if modification is feasable to increase
°           production work.

°Wait to start time.
°
°          If unacceptable for batch:
°           -   Evaluate the number of initiators used.
°           -   Evaluate the initiator to job class structure.
°
°          If acceptable for batch:
°           -   Check CPU time between page faults. If less than
°               50 ms, check common pageins caused by jobs. If
°               greater than 50 ms, check other uses of the CPU
°               (SRB, supervisor time).
°           -   Check ENQ contention.

°For TSO trivial commands compare wait to start time to 1/2
°second.

°          If wait to start time is less than 1/2 second.
°           -   Check CPU time between page faults. If less than
°               50 ms, check common page-ins caused by tasks. If
°               greater than 50 ms, check other uses of the CPU
°               (SRB, supervisor time).
°           -   Check ENQ contention.

°          If wait to start time is greater than 1/2 second.

°           -   Determine the component parts of the wait to start
°           time. If swap in time is the major factor then
°           consider more swap data sets or spreading swap and
°           page data sets. If the swap in time is not the major
°           component: Increase the weight for the TSO trivial
°           domain. Increase the minimum and maximum MPL. Separate
°           trivial and non trivial commands into different
°           domains.

°f.   Real Storage Critical

°Since the only way the system has of relieving real storage
°shortage situations is by swapping or paging, see the swapping
°and paging section.

°g.   Operational Interactions - Use syslog or console log to
°observe any operation anomolies.

°          Missing tape mounts, or excessive amount of time for
°           mounts.
°          Shift changes may require additional overlap.
°          Job queues may be held or manipulated.
°          Schedule work in a more optimal fashion.
°
°h.   Priority
°
°Use DPRTY to order types of work (e.g., Interactive, TP line
°handlers, critical batch, etc.,).  DPRTY can be used to run tasks
°outside the APG.

°If less ready users than maximum MPL:  Consider increasing
°minimum MPL to increase sensitivity to peak load situations.

°j.   Channels

°Values less than 30% busy are ideal, periodic 40-50% busy are
°very bad, and values greater than 50% are a major problem.

°Is channel utilization high?

°           load across several channels.
°          Install priority I/O zap to force servicing most
°           inportant work first.
°          Balance channels and control units.

°           units.
°          Install more control units if queue lengths are long.
°          Install faster devices.
°          Examine contention caused by string switches.
°          Don't share devices when not required (consider
°           turning off shared bit in UCB).
°          Redesign DASD configuration to the usage pattern of
°           MVS. The original configuration was probably designed
°           for MVT and some of the basic assumptions are no
°           longer valid.
°          Implement work scheduling.

°     Other areas that can decrease I/O delay include:
°
°          Decrease MPL.
°          Increase blocksize to decrease number of I/O requests.
°          Use VIO if CPU cycles are available.
°          Watch for any allocation that require more than one
°           extent.
°          Schedule heavy I/O users to times of low total I/O
°           demand.

°          DASDI:
°           Although allocation routines have been rewritten for
°           increased parellelism, some installations may still
°           run into the problem of serialization due to mounts.

°          Shared DASD:
°           In general it remains a problem, although MP can

°4.   SYSGEN planning
°
°     a.    Device classes to reduce serialization.
°              Have many esoteric names for small groups of
°               devices.
°              Use VIO because it doesn't serialize.
°              Separate scratch for TSO & Batch.
°     b.    Master catalog
°              Pointer in SYS1.NUCLEUS can be changed (see
°               Conversion Notebook GC28-0689).
°              Put where you want it after Stage 2, don't let
°               SYSGEN define it.
°              If it has to be moved (this is very difficult), be
°               sure it is in the right place and size when you
°               come up. Consider future generations and isolate
°               from all other SYS1 data sets. (see SYSGEN
°               manual).
°              Be careful with the allocation of data sets, so
°               that you use enough size, don't assume that you
°               want the catalog, PROCLIB, PARALIB on SYSRES.
°              LPALIB is only needed at CLPA time, so put away
°               from the VTOC.
°     c.    Sysgen not model dependent 158-168 etc.
°     d.    ACRDODE - if an MP is not in your future, do not
°           specify and it will save about 1K in the nucleus.
°     e.    OLTEP needs an APF library.
°     f.    Storage size - ASM tables are built from this;
°           therefore, if storage constrained , leave out to force
°           NIP to set the maximum online storage as storage size.
°     g.    Most of CTRLPROG parameters can be changed at IPL
°           time.
°     h.    JES3 must be the primary subsystem if more than one
°           subsystem used.
°     i.    All subsystems must be defined at SYSGEN.
°     j.    Consoles - make sure the alternate console chain does
°           not loop back in the middle; this can cause failure to
°           reach all consoles.
°     k.    TSO defaults.
°              Review data set blocksizes, use larger blocksizes
°               on larger systems.
°              Watch blocksize compatability, JCL and source must
°               be the same.
°     l.    Stage 2 can be run under production MVT by using the
°           job card MACRO to put in what is acceptable to your
°           system. (MVS must be used for AMS, defining page
°           spaces).
°     m.    WTO buffers should be set much higher than default
°           which is 20, to avoid wait prior to JES startup.

°PROBLEM:       Adding esoteric UNITNAMES or adding addresses to
°               an esoteric UNITNAME requires an I/O SYSGEN to be
°               performed.

°SOLUTION:      Add a modified GENERATE MACRO to produce just
°               those tables used for device allocation.

°EXAMPLE:       See below.
°               Changes provided are the minimum required to

°BENEFITS:      Reduction of individual and computer time for
°               SYSGEN processing. This routine can be used as a
°               temporary circumvention until a user written

°               the most current SYSGEN of the system to be
°               updated.

°           1.  Make a copy of GENERATE in SYS1.AGENLIB and rename
°               it (e.g.QUICKGEN).
°           2.  Make the following updates to MACRO QUICKGEN with

°           3.  Perform I/O SYSGEN replacing 'GENERATE' MACRO with
°               'QUICKGEN'.
°           4.  Run the 5 assemblies produced from sysgen output.
°           5.  Using SMP, receive and apply 3 object csects
°               (IEFWMAS1,IEFWMSKA,IEFEDTTB) into your system.

°DATA SET TUNING
°
°A.   Non VSAM
°
°     1.    PLPA
°
°              Put AMS in PLPA, this eliminates a requirement of
°               512K for TSO users and batch. (See data set tuning
°               1.0).
°              The location of SYS1.LPALIB is unimportant
°               (possible demountable volume).
°              Consider the tradeoff between storage (size of
°               PLPA) and I/O to LINKLIB, CMDLIB, etc.  If storage
°               is not a bottleneck, put everything possible in
°               PLPA. (Reentrant processors, etc.)
°              Be more selective about which modules to put in
°               PLPA (most highly used) when you are core limited.
°              SMP must be told of any moves to PLPA from other
°               data sets.

°     2.    CMDLIB

°              If storage is available, put it in PLPA.
°              Depending on the number of modules in PLPA,
°               packing can be important.

°     3.    MANX, MANY

°              TCLOSE with write validity check is done every
°               time a buffer is written; therefore place the data
°               sets close to the VTOC. Write validity check may
°               be removed via an available zap.
°              Large blocksize means fewer TCLOSES and DSCB
°               accesses (8K buffer).
°              Unwanted or unneeded SMF records should not be
°               written. In a heavy TSO user system Type 40
°               records can be as much as 45% of total SMF.
°              Until IBM makes the change that allows record
°               types to be accumulated according to an entry in
°               PARMLIB, unwanted records can be turned off in two
°               ways.

°               a)  Use the U-83 exit and don't write records you
°                   don't need.

°               b)  No-op the SMF SVC in the module that writes
°                   the unwanted SMF record. The Release 3.7 SMF
°                   manual gives the module name that writes each
°                   type.

¸
°     4.    SPOOL space

°              3350 is a prime candidate. Put the checkpoint
°               dataset under the fixed head if the spool pack is
°               not a shared volume. For shared DASD, do not place
°               the checkpoint data set on a spool volume.
°              Use multiple spool devices for performance.

°     5.    VTOC

°              High water mark of format 0 DSCBs should be reset
°               periodically to limit the VTOC searches. Zap the
°               DIRF bit to force DADISM to fix up the VTOC.
°              Placement depends on actual data on pack.  Are the
°               datasets opened frequently or just once like
°               certain IMS datasets?
°              Usually place it 1/3 to 1/2 of the way into the
°               volume.

°     6.    PROCLIBS

°              There are serious performance problems with
°               multiple non-concatenated proclibs because of
°               multiple opens and closes in JES2.
°              There is a tradeoff between maintainability and
°               performance with multiple proclibs.
°              JES will not start if a concatenated proclib is
°               not found during initialization.

°     7.    OS CVOLS - Should be placed next to the VTOC to reduce
°           head movement, because the CVOL is LOCATED for every
°           job step requiring reference to it.

°     8.    Cylinder allocation - Can be a performance gain
°           especially for link libraries.

°               Reason: Multi-track reads to a data set will cause
°               an I/O interrupt at the end of each track for data
°               libraries under the fixed head of a 3350.
°              If you have high activity modules you may want to
°               place those modules in BLDL; you may also want to
°               restructure the library so that the high use
°               modules are next to the directory.

°B.   VSAM

°     1.    Page spaces

°              If core is not limited, PLPA isn't used much and
°               should be put on a slower device (3330 not 2314).
°              If TSO is the chief objective, the first swap
°               dataset should go on fastest device (drum).
°              Split page datasets on different channels with no
°               more than 2 active page spaces per channel.
°              Several smaller ones may be better than few large
°               ones, (but only one per volume).
°              If not using checkpoint restart specity CVIO;
°               otherwise, VIO temporary datasets may remain in
°               pagespace after system failure.

°     2.    STGINDEX - It is used only for jobs requesting
°           journalling.

°     3.    VSAM catalog

°              Put it on a separate pack away from residence
°               volume for ease in maintenance.
°              Use a buffer space parameter of 8192 (if storage
°               is available).
°              Put CVOLs in random order when converting
°               catalogs.  (Otherwise there will be too many C.I.
°               splits because AMS does not use sequential insert.
°               You then have too many half used control
°               intervals).
°              The estimates of size in conversion notebook is
°               good.
°              The VSAM catalog should be on a non-shared volume
°               (ie.shared bit off in the UCB).

°     4.    VSAM user datasets

°              See the SRL for VSAM Options for Advanced
°               Applications.

°              The VSAM ICR (Enhanced VSAM) should be applied to
°               MVS Systems prior to 3.7.

°     1.    Heavy use of VIO may hurt system performance in a real
°           storage constrained environment.  It can also make TSO
°           response erratic.

°     2.    As the block size of the data set increases, the
°           benefits of VIO diminish.  VIO may use more CPU, but
°           run in less elapsed time.  See IBM's Conversion
°           Notebook.

°     3.    Nothing is gained by using more than one buffer for a
°           VIO data set.  Have 2314s sysgend first for virtual
°           devices to get more efficient VIO usage.   Use 3330s
°           for the actual paging devices to get 2 pages, 7K + CB,
°           instead of 3.1 pages.  Characteristics use determined
°           by first device, but other device types in the group
°           can be used for paging.

°     4.    In most shops, the simplest significant performance
°           improvement for VIO will probably come about from its
°           use for work data sets in compiles and utilities, and
°           for TSP EDIT work files.

°     5.    Avoid using VIO for large data sets.
°
°     6.    Don't use VIO for sort work data sets.
°
°     7.    Don't use VIO for SYSUT1 of IEHMOVE.
°
°     8.    Allocate VIO datasets on cylinder boundaries.
°
°     9.    If concerned about real storage, use a 2314 window device.
°
°    10.    If concerned about controlling users, consider a 2305 window
°
°    11.    CPU time required for VIO increases above real I/O.

°SYSTEM PARAMETERS
°
°1.   COMMNDxx -    Used to structure the system during IPL. For
°     performance reasons TRACE=OFF (trace table turned off)
°     should be specified.

°2.   IEAAPFxx -    The APF library table is built in core from
°     this specification. Note: the size of this table must be
°     less than 2040 bytes. This constant is in the nucleus and
°     may be zapped.

°3.   IEABLDxx

°          Is 4096 in length and each entry is 60 bytes long.
°          It should be monitored and updated regularly.
°          It is of more benefit if the linklist is long. The
°           BLDL value is directly proportional to length of
°           linklist.
°          BLDL list may be fixed or pageable. Fixed BLDL is
°           recommended for small lists only.
°          GTF may be used to analyze SVC 18 usage.  Excessive
°           use of BLDL may indicate a candidate for inclusion in
°           the list.

°4.   IEAFIXxx -    Use of fix list has negative and positive
°                   aspects:

          Positive -  Modules in fix list are located more
°           ________
°                       quickly than in Linklib or PLPA. No page
°                       faults are generated by the modules, fix
°                       lists are in real storage and are good for
°                       such things as CCW translation.

          Negative -  Fix list modules take up real storage even
°           ________
°                       if they are not used.  Fix list modules
°                       are located via a CDE and are always on
°                       the active LPA queue. Modules on PLPA or
°                       Linklib thus take more time to locate. Fix
°                       list modules are placed at the top of the
°                       Nucleus space and are rounded up to a 4K
°                       boundary. Thus if a module slightly
°                       exceeds 4K in size the rest of the page is
                       wasted. A module in the fix list cannot be
°                                                        ______

°5.   IEAIPSxx
°
°          An inappropriate IPS can degrade system performance
°           easily.
°          See the SRM section for more detail on the IPS
°           selection process.

°6.   IEALODxx -    PLPA modules specified in the load list will
°     be found more quickly than those that are not, but module
°     searches for PLPA modules will take longer to find because
°     of the longer queue search. If a module is heavily used,
°     there is a good probability that the module will already be
°     in main storage and the CDE will be on the LPA queue. If the
     module is not heavily used but requires rapid access, you
°               ___
°     may use the fixed LPA or pre-load the module via an
°     application program.

°7.   IEALPAxx -    Both the module name and any alias entries
°     must be specified.

°8.   IEAOPTxx

°          If you want the 00 member, it must be specified, since
°           there is no default.
°          Default value for ERV is 1. This implies that 1 CPU
°           service unit is given before a swap. In some cases
°           this may cause an increase in the amount of CPU and
°           I/O resources used. If RMF indicates a high number of
°           swaps due to ENQ exchange, this number should be
°           increased. ERV=500 is a suggested compromise.

°          There are programs around to build pack lists based on
°           PSW samples (see MVS project program tape).
°          A good pack list can increase available CPU and real
°           storage. The gain is greatest in a storage constrained
°           environment.
°          Pack list creation is an ongoing process due to the
°           fact that operating system modifications (SU
°           installation, PTF, etc.) may have an impact on the
°           effectiveness of a pack list.

°          SQA/CSA     Too much cuts down on private area. The
°                       more address spaces active the more
°                       SQA/CSA needed. IMS is a heavy user of
°                       CSA. A constant in the nucleus may be
°                       zapped to allow CSA to increse beyond 4
°                       megabytes.
°          CVIO        Should be used for every IPL unless you

°SRM
°
°1.   What the SRM can and should do:

°          Used to bias system resources delivered to users.

°          Tries to enforce installation specified performance
°           objectives by swapping.

°          SRM interprets performance objectives to determine
°           relative importance of particular users. Based upon
°           these objectives, the SRM will either swap a user in
°           storage or out.

°          Certain users cannot be swapped; e.g., online DB/DC
°           systems.

°          Certain users can be swapped; e.g., normal batch jobs.

°          Certain users must be swapped; e.g., TSO users.

°          Low service rate objectives for first period TSO
°           results in calculation of "swap-in delay". This can be
°           used to artificially slow TSO response.

°          Performance objectives are unimportant to online DB/DC
°           systems and other non-swappable users.

°          Performance objectives are potentially important to
°           batch jobs if resource shortages (especially storage)
°           develop.

°          Performance objectives are very important to TSO
°           users.

°          Dispatching priority (DPRTY) is of vital importance.

°          DPRTY is only means of control for non-swappable
°           users.

°2.   Tailoring an IPS to an installation.

°          Define like categories of work (domains); e.g., Batch,
°           TSO trivial, TSO medium, TSO long transactions,
°           started tasks, high priority batch, CICS, IMS.  Define
°           one domain for each category of work.

°          Specify domain MPL constraints.  The minimum MPLs are
°           very significant in terms of system performance.

°          Define the weighting factor for each domain. Values
°           too close together prevent discrimination between
°           domains.

°          Define performance groups and periods and associate a
°           domain for each group of users.

¸
°          Use the APG specification to assign a range of
°           dispatching priorities. (APG is very important to non-
°           swappable address spaces).

°          Construct reasonable performance objectives. Initially
°           retain period durations and ISV values from previous
°           IPS. This allows you to compare MF/1 and RMF values

°3.   IPS Notes.

°          Without a unique domain for started tasks, the time
°           required to get a started task into execution becomes
°           excessive.

°          Running last period TSO transactions in a batch domain
°           may result in excessive preemption of batch jobs as
°           TSO users switch into the batch domain.

°          There is no reason to use a workload level
°           specification of more than four points. Additional
°           points will not be used later in performance objective
°           definition and only complicate the IPS.

°          A reduction in the trivial domain maximum MPL is more
°           acceptable than a reduction in the minimum MPL for
°           subsequent TSO domains. This delays the user prior to
°           swap-in, whereas reducing the maximum MPL may force an
°           exchange swap as the TSO transaction period switches
°           into the new domain.

°          To reduce exchange swaps:

           - Specify larger ISV's or smaller service definition
°                                  __
°           coefficients

°           - Construct objectives with a nearly vertical slope.

°           - Take all objectives within a domain to zero at the
°           same point.

°4.   SRM MPL adjustment summary.
°
°     Each domain should represent work with like characteristics.
°     A domain is defined with a minimum and maximum multi-
°     programming level and a weighting factor indicating its
°     relative importance. The SRM will adjust the target MPL
°     between the minimum and maximum MPL by using the contention
°     index and several system resource indicators. The weighting
°     factor from the IPS isused to calculate the contention
°     index. (Which is basically the ready user average times the
°     weighting factor).

°     System resource utilization is determined by monitoring the
°     following indicators in the RCT:

°           1.  CPU (RCVAVQC)
°           2.  Unreferenced interval count (RCVUICA)
°           3.  Auxiliary storage manager queue length (RCVASMQA)
°           4.  Average number of deferred IO requests (RCVTOTDF)
°           5.  Page fault rate from non-swap and non-VIO
°               page-ins plus reclaims (RCVPTR)
°
°     If the system utilization is high the target MPL of the
°     domain with the lowest contention index is lowered. If the
°     utilization is low, the domain with the highest contention
°     index is increased.  If the utilization is acceptable, the
°     target MPL's are adjusted to balance the contention indices.

°ASM Considerations with SU7
°
°1.   A minimum of three page data sets is required; PLPA, COMMON,
°     and LOCAL.

°2.   The PLPA data set can overflow into the COMMON data set and
°     vice versa. However, PLPA or COMMON cannot overflow into a
°     LOCAL page dataset. Therefore it is critical to be sure that
°     the PLPA and COMMON page data sets are large enough to
°     contain all that they must.

°3.   Both swap and local page data set activity is round-robined
°     across devices with similar characteristics, e.g., fixed-
°     head devices (2305) and moveable-head devices
°     (3350,3330,...).

°4.   Duplexing of the common are is optional and governed by the
°     DUPLEX operand in the IEASYSXX member of PARMLIB. The value
°     of duplexing is not worth the overhead generated.

°5.   Swap data sets may be used for LSQA pages. They are
°     recommended for installations with high TSO activity. Swap
°     and page data sets may be dynamically added to the system
°     after IPL.  They cannot subsequently be deleted.

°6.   In a storage constrained system, PLPA and the first local
°     page space are the best candidates for a 2305 device. In all
°     other systems the first local page space is the best
°     candidate.

°7.   Allow extra space for all page data sets except PLPA, to
°     permit the creation of additional address spaces before
°     current ones are deleted and to permit some reasonable
°     increase in the number of concurrent VIO data sets.

°8.   Page data sets should be contiguous to avoid arm movement
°     across multiple extents.

°9.   The size of the PLPA data set can be reduced by properly
°     packing the LPA modules.

°10.  The fixed portion of a 3350 is a good candidate for a swap
°     data set.

°11.  Bad slots in a pagespace may degrade performance. RMF gives
°     statistics on bad slots.

°KEYPHRASE:     Slot turnaround
°
°PROBLEM:       Determining quality of service from a page data in
°               deciding to add data sets, etc.

°SOLUTION:      Look at ASM's evaluation of the average turnaround
°               time for a page and total usage of the data set.

°To determine ASM's internal evaluation of slot turnaround, take a
°stand alone dump or use the 'dump' command to take a dump of
°ASID=01.

°In the ASMDATA portion of the formatted dump:

°           PARERQTM  =  average turnaround per
°                        slot to this page dataset
°           PARESZSL  =  size of pagespace in slots
°           PARESLTA  =  available slots
°
°           PARERQTM values are microseconds. This number should
°           fall within the following range for good paging:

°               2314      20000 - 24000
°               3330      10000 - 12000
°               2305-2     5000 -  7000
°               3350       7000 -  9000
°
°With SU7, these values may be obtained under program control,
°directly from the Paging Activity Reference Table (PART).

°KEYPHRASE:     SLOTC and SLOTV
°
°ENVIRONMENT:   3 mb 168 batch/TSO/IMS/CICS
°
°PROBLEM:       The default values for ILRSLOTC AND ILRSLOTV in
°               IEANUC01 cause the auxiliary storage manager to
°               reserve excessive amounts of page space for each
°               ASID.

°SOLUTION:      Change the defaults to you own specifications.

°EXAMPLE:       In our installation we changed the default VIO
°               space allocation fact (ILRSLOTV) from 4 to 48, and
°               the default region space allocation factor
°               (ILRSLOTC) from 4 to 18.  For example, the default
°               allocation for VIO was reduced from 1024 to 86
°               page frames.

°BENEFITS:      Reduced paging space requirements.

°WARNINGS:      Using an extremely large ILRSLOTC to trim paging
°               space requirements could result in a shortage of
°               auxiliary storage.

°JOB TUNING
°
°An approach to tuning jobs
°
°1.   Determine what you want to accomplish.

°     Reduce CPU utilization? Reduce paging activity?  Decrease
°     elapsed time of certain critical jobs?  Reduce channel
°     usage? An improvement in one area will often cost you in
°     another.

°2.   Identify those jobs which need to be tuned.

°     SMF can be scanned to pick out programs with high CPU usage,
°     high paging activity, high EXCP counts, etc. Software
°     monitors and special operator commands can isolate programs
°     (and jobs) with high real storage requirements during
°     periods of heavy paging activity.

°3.   Work with the responsible programmer to see what can be done.
°
°     Without his or her cooperation and help, there's not much
°     you can do. (Data Management is area of highest benefit).
°     Some common solutions:

°     a.    To reduce channel bottlenecks and/or excp counts:

°              Increase blocksize.
°              Increase DCB BUFNO when chained scheduling is
°               used.
°              Use VIO where possible.

°     b.    To reduce paging activity:

°              Restructure program (put related CSECTS close
°               together; put subroutines in-line; etc.)
°              Use fewer buffers and/or smaller blocksizes.
°              Reduce use of VIO.
°              Restructure job mix, if possible, to avoid
°               simultaneously running jobs requiring a lot of
°               real storage.

°     c.    To decrease elapsed time of a critical job:

°              Increase blocksizes.
°              Run it in a higher performance group.
°              Reduce contention with other tasks (fewer
°               initiators, etc.)
°              If a sort, give it more storage to work with.
°              Make improvements in the other areas (CPU usage,
°               channel usage, paging activity).

°JOB TUNING (Continued)

°     d.    To reduce CPU usage:

°              Increase blocksizes.
°              For frequently used jobs reduce supervisor time
°               whenever possible.
°               -   Reduce getmain/freemain activity -
°                   get one large block and use 'cells'.
°               -   Handle page management when possible -
°                   PGFIX/FREE/RLSE/LOAD.
°               -   Process as many datasets as possible with one
°                   OPEN/CLOSE.
°               -   Use of a serial table search where a binary
°                   search would be more efficient.
°               -   Poor use of COBOL's TRANSFORM, EXAMINE,
°                   STRING, and UNSTRUNG verbs (or similar
°                   features in other languages).
°               -   Failure to use an efficient assembler
°                   subroutine when the desired processing cannot
°                   be done efficiently in a high level language.
°               -   Frequent data conversions due to mixed mode
°                   arithmetic.
°               -   Repeated opens, reads, and closes of a "table"
°                   file rather than reading it into main storage
°                   once and processing it there.
°               -   Unnecessary data movement in main storage.
°               -   Constant use of a SPIE routine to avoid 0C7
°                   abend when doing numeric operations on blank
°                   data fields.
°               -   Allowing SORT to have an unlimited amount of
°                   storage.

°SMF
°
°1.   A contributing factor to overhead caused by SMF data
°     recording is the use of write-validity check (OPTCD=W) with
°     the SYS1.MAN datasets. This can be removed with a ZAP (SMF
°     1.0).

°2.   The recording of SMF records in which the installation is
°     not interested should be avoided. One method is to NOP the
°     SVC 83 (SMFWTM) in the routine creating the record (SMF
°     2.0).  Another method is to use the IEFU83 exit to prevent
°     writing the record to the SMF dataset. A sample IEFU83 exit
°     provided with the IPO system provides this facility.

°3.   If the installation uses the IEFACTRT exit to write JOB/STEP
°     information, then the information contained in messages
°     IEF373I, IEF374I, IEF375I, IEF376I may be redundant. These
°     can be eliminated by ZAP (SMF 3.0).

°
°The following guidelines have proved useful in tuning IMS 1.1.1
°on a 4M 168.

°     1.    Pools should be adjusted to eliminate failures. This
°           is an effort that must be done an a continuing basis
°           because each change may or may not provide a
°           sufficient pool size.

°     2.    Use a program pre-load on applications that are high
°           in usage.

°     3.    Specify EXCPVR to page fix some of the I/O code and
°           minimize CCW translation.

°     4.    Specify index-in-core option for ISAM to reduce the
°           ISAM I/O activity.

°     5.    Make the MPR's and control region non-swapable to
°           guarantee CPU availability.

°     6.    Set the dispatching priority for the IMS control
°           region higher than the MPR's and these should be above
°           APG, BATCH, and (depending on environments) possibly
°           TSO.

°     7.    Set-up common blocksize to minimize buffer pool
°           compactions. (BFPLBSZ option).

°     8.    Make sure there are enough FRE's to support the
°           3270's.

°     9.    Turn off buffer handler trace (BHTRACE=0), on the
°           DFSVSAMP DD card to reduce IMS overhead.

°     10.   Split data sets across more than one pack, control
°           unit and channel. (Move the LGMSG, SHMSG and QBLKS
°           data sets off IMS control pack). Adjustments may be
°           necessary to balance the IMS packs and minimize each
°           ones usage.

°     11.   Review, frequently, the high overhead transactions
°           (selected from monitor and log tape statistics for
°           large CPU and large number of calls).

°     12.   Run IMS/VS control region in protect key #7.  This
°           will reduce overhead by shortening some path lengths
°           for some supervisor services.

°     13.   Order control region and fix the most active portions,
°           typically 30%-40%.

°     14.   Investigate placing high use transients (such as PLI
°           error handling etc.) in LPALIB or preloading them.

°REFERENCES:    IOS Program Logic
°KEYPHRASE:     Channel Rotate
°
°ENVIRONMENT:   DASD/TAPE Devices With OPTCHAN
°
°PROBLEM:       MVS/IOS does not rotate physical channel paths to
°               a TAPE/DASD device.

°SOLUTION:      Update macro that creates logical channels for
°               inclusion of a flag byte and modify IOS to
°               FLIP/FLOP physical channels.

°EXAMPLE:       MOD attached - update for macro and superzap for
°               module in IOS.

°BENEFITS:      Instead of requiring the operator to vary paths
°               offline to prevent IOS from using only the lowest
°               channel address. Both channels to a device will be

°1.   Evaluate TSO in or out of APG. Generally the later periods
°     (longer transactions) should be placed in APG priority.

°2.   IPS and task dispatching priority are most effective in a
°     TSO environment, particularly with the SRM SU installed.

°3.   The TIOC buffer is pageable.

°4.   Add SYS1.CMLIB to LPALIB - must remain on LNKLIST due to
°     BLBLs by edit (see TSO 6.0). Watch for overflow from PLPA to
°     second page data set.

°5.   Add AMS to LPALIB.

°6.   Use VIO wherever possible. (See VIO section).

°7.   A Fixed BLDL list for frequently used commands and
°     subcommands has been of use.

°8.   Also see the TCAM section, for some areas that are strongly
°     TSO related.

°PROBLEM:       Switching from one proclib to another.
°
°SOLUTION:      Use only one proclib and have TSO procs start with
°               a character high in collating sequence; i.e., #,
°               @, or $, reducing the directory search. Also,

°               overhead involved in switching libraries between
°               batch and logon.

°
°PROBLEM:       Eliminate overhead of LINK or LOAD SVC's for
°               frequently invoked user modules.

°SOLUTION:      Utilize module IKJEFXSR to place address of module
°               in CVT. Module can then be invoked via CALL
°               instead of LINK or LOAD. IKJEFXSR searches the
°               LINKPACK area for the specific module and places
°               its addtess at the specified offset within the
°               CVT.  The high-order bit is turned on in the
°               address field. IKJEFXSR contains a table of
°               entries of modules whose addresses are to be added
°               to the CVT. Each table entry is twelve bytes long
°               and of the form:

°                   DC  CL8'NAME'
°                   DC  AL4(CVT-OFFSET)
°
°               The table starts at +560 and runs through +5D7.
°               IKJEFXSR can be expanded and new entries added at
°               the end of the table. The last entry in the table
°               is determined by a LA instruction at +11C. This
°               must be changed to point to the last entry added.

°WARNING:       The modules whose addresses are to be added to the
°               CVT must reside in the LINKPACK area.

°KEYPHRASE:     JES2 Automatic Command Facility BOOTSTRAP
°
°BENEFIT:       The JES2 Automatic Command Facility may be used to
°               good effect in controlling standard systems
°               functions such as date/time stamping and printing
°               the systems logs, controlling RMF, etc., and may
°               be used to bootstrap itself. Properly set up, the
°               facility will operate correctly across IPLs, etc.

°SOLUTION:      The following strategy was employed:

°               1.  A member of PARMLIB was defined, "AUTOCMND".
°                   This member contains all commands to be
°                   established in the Automatic Command Facility
                   for the 24-hour period. Note that the last
°                                                         ____
°                   command, to be executed 25 hours from the
°                   midnight previous to the commands being set up
                   (i.e, one the next morning), bootstraps the
°                                 ____
°                   command set for the next day. Specific command
°                   ID numbers are assigned to force command
°                   replacement for those commands still in effect
°                   when the commands bootstrap at 1 AM (to avoid
°                   multiple "D T" every 10 minutes, for example).

°               2.  A standard IEBGENER to INTRDR from the PARMLIB
°                   AUTOCMND member is defined in SYS1.PROCLIB,
°                   such that the command "S AUTOCMND" will result
°                   in the automatic commands being fed to the
°                   internal reader.

°               3.  The INTRDR must be defined as allowing
°                   commands (JES2 initialization parameters)

°               4.  An "s autocmnd" must be placed in the commands
°                   executed by JES2 during initialization to
°                   cause the initial loading of the automatic
°                   commands.

WARNING:       DO NOT use the L= operand on the $TA commands in
°                  ___
°               AUTOCMND. If the console specified by L= is not
°               available at the time "s autocmnd" is issued, the
°               commands will be flushed and never set.
°
°EXAMPLE:       Sample AUTOCMND Member of SYS1.PARMLIB:
°
°/*$TA900,I=600,'$VS,''D T'''          /* DISPLAY TIME EVERY 10 MINUTES
°/*$TA901,I=7200,'$VS,''S DUMPCHK'''   /* CHK DUMP DS EVERY 2 HOURS */
°/*$TA903,T=24.00,'$VS,''S RMF.RMF'''  /* WRITE LOGS AT MIDNIGHT */

°               enhancements No. 1 (VS203805) is also necessary
°               since it is a prerequisite of VS203807.

°PROBLEM;       Performance/MF1 tuning tool supplied with MVS
°               lacks information desirable for tuning system.

°TYPE:          TOOL
°RELEASE:       Version 2.0
°REFERENCES:    TSA REFERENCE GUIDE
°KEYPHRASE:     TSA (Total System Analyzer)
°
°ENVIRONMENT:   Any MVS system
°
°PROBLEM:       Performance
°
°SOLUTION:      TSA is a software monitor designed to collect CPU
°               user data. TSA reports on the total CPU usage by
°               SVC modules, system task modules, and problem
°               program modules. The overall CPU usage can be
°               broken down in finer detail by specific module and
°               further by the calling job name to accurately
°               portray not only how the CPU usage was distributed
°               throughout the system but also which jobs were
°               using modules of particular interest. Histogram
°               reports for modules of special interest can be
°               obtained to identify the specific instruction
°               locations of high CPU activity. Time oriented
°               plots of CPU usage can be obtained by module or by
°               the entire system to identify patterns in system
°               behavior or to analyze specific time intervals
°               when bottlenecks occur. TSA may also be utilized
°               to create data for the PPE analyzer.

°BENEFIT:       Provides the user with necessary data to eliminate
°               module bottlenecks, optimize high CPU usage areas
°               in programs, reduce total CPU usage, and decrease
°               TP system response time.
