 SAS PROGRAMS TO READ HURON/OBJECT STAR SMF RECORDS.

 THEY ALL ASSUME THAT SMF RECORDS FOR HURON/OBJECT STAR
 HAVE BEEN SEPARATED OUT FROM OTHER SMF INTO THEIR OWN
 DATASET.  SEE SAS PROGRAM SMFEXTR IN THE OTHER PDS OF
 SAS PROGRAMS FOR WAY TO DO THIS.  ALTERNATIVELY ADD A
 SAS STATEMENT TO SELECT THE APPROPRIATE SMF RECORD
 TYPE AFTER THE INPUT IS READ.
