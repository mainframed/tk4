//*           Tape.  The mapping from the former files on this      *

//*           Bill Godfrey's original version of TSSO is still      *
//*           on File 306 of the CBT MVS Utilities Tape.            *
//*                                                                 *
//*           The Time Sharing Subsystem Option (TSSO) is a         *
//*           package designed to increase operator productivity    *
//*           by automating tasks which need not be performed       *
//*           manually.  TSSO performs its function through three   *
//*           integrated components.  The Operator Productivity     *
//*           Facility (OPF) extends the power of TSO to the        *
//*           MVS operator's console.  The Automated Operations     *
//*           Facility (AOF) enhances an installation's             *
//*           ability to control system events based on console     *
//*           message traffic.  An interface to the Network         *
//*           Communication Control Facility (NCCF) allows the      *
//*           network operator to use TSSO as a command processor,  *
//*           issuing and receiving operating system commands at    *
//*           the NCCF terminal.  Note that NCCF is now an inte-    *
//*           grated part of Netview.  TSSO also enhances end-user  *
//*           productivity by allowing end-user access to the MVS   *
//*           Command Subsystem.  A complete User's Guide,          *
//*           including detailed installation instructions exists   *
//*           in member UG43TERM in this file.                      *
//*                                                                 *
//*           A guide to the new features of TSSO Version 4,        *
//*           Release 3 is in the member RELGDE43 in this file.     *
//*                                                                 *
//*           Anyone with an interest in automated operations is    *
//*           invited to look at TSSO as a software tool providing  *
//*           many of the primitives required for common automated  *
//*           operations tasks.  These primitives include the       *
//*           hilighting, lowlighting, replying and reacting to     *
//*           operating system messages.  This is in addition to    *
//*           the ability to issue a command and retrieve the       *
//*           response in CLIST variables.                          *
//*                                                                 *

//*                                                                 *
//*      Note on Dave Cartwright's modifications:                   *
//*                                                                 *
//*         The purpose of these modifications is to allow TSSO     *
//*         to handle automated message processing with multi-      *
//*         line WTO's and to do other new functions.  File 402     *
//*         has been merged into TSSO 4.3 by Guy Albertelli.  So    *
//*         it's probably best to ignore File 402 and install       *
//*         File 404 instead, which is an OS/390 upgrade of the     *
//*         former File 403.  As noted above, the former Files      *
//*         401 thru 403 have been moved to the CBT Overflow Tape.  *
//*                                                                 *
