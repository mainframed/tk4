When I finally settled down to a permanent job in Blighty it was at a
greenfield MVS site (OS/390 2.6) to replace a VM network machine.
Although Netview(TM) was in use for network automation there was no
product doing MVS console automation.  As a quick and dirty fix I
installed TSSO as modified by Guy Albertelli to run under OS/390.  I
knew and loved TSSO of old.  I liked what Guy had done to the AOF table
but I eventually discovered that there was a downside; the Boolean logic
I had added while at Sprecher Energie had been deliberately excised.
This was fine for simplicity, but the AOF processing that I had built
for IEF238D now resulted in replies of both WAIT and CANCEL, with the
same reply id.  Fortunately it was fairly easy to change TSSOSS09 to   -
reinstate the SEAG logic, Guy's version is retained as member XSSOSS09.


*****   AOF Table Processing.


TSSO 4.3++ processing of the AOF table is as follows:
  -When table is loaded (or reloaded) a binary search index is
   created based on the MSG= parameter. All identical entries are
   chained together. All MSG=* entries are chained together.
  -Major and minor WQEs processed.
  -For each message processed, the binary index is searched and if
   found, the chained entries are processed until a matching entry
   is found with no entry id.
  -All messages are also passed to all MSG=* entries.


The MSG=* entries are still  processed after all other entries are
processed.


****    Other Modifications

REPLY, REPLYLOA
I didn't see how REPLYLOA could work, so I gave up trying and looked
for another way to get the CMB chains.  In file 19 of the CBT tape I
found another reply type program which contained a csect called REPLY.
This did what I wanted, so I grafted it in.  To avoid confusion I kept
the name REPLY for the TSSO version, John Hooper's code was renamed
LIONRPLY. Guy's REPLYLOA is there as REPLYLOB.

CLIST
I added a couple of CLISTS that I find useful plus an example of their
usage.  I put these at the end of the CLISTS member, out of alphabetic
sequence.  I think IEBUPDTE etc. can handle this, if not I'm sorry.

TSSOCCMD
Without bothering to find out how consoles work in OS/390 I just made
this routine default to the Master Console. A quick & dirty fix.

The sterling work of Guy Albertelli, Jim Lane and John Hooper is
gratefully acknowledged.
