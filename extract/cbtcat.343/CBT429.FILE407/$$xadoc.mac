                DOCUMENTATION FOR XA VERSION OF DYNABLDL


      DYNABLDL HAS BEEN CHANGED TO RUN UNDER XA.  UNDER XA, IT IS A
REPLACEMENT FOR LLA.  IN ORDER TO USE DYNABLDL UNDER XA, YOU MUST STOP
LLA FIRST, THEN START THE DYNABLDL PROC.

      AT PRESENT, THE XA VERSION OF DYNABLDL IS A DIFFERENT PROGRAM
FROM THE MVS/370 VERSION.  THE XA SOURCE IS CALLED "DYNABLDX" ON THIS
PDS, AND THE SAMPLE JOB TO ASSEMBLE AND LINKEDIT THE XA VERSION IS
CALLED $ASMLINX.  THE XA ASSEMBLY MUST BE DONE WITH ASSEMBLER H VERSION
2.  AMODE OF THE LOAD MODULE MUST BE 31, RMODE IS 24.

      IT IS UP TO THE USER TO DECIDE IF LLA OR DYNABLDL IS BETTER FOR
HIS OWN SHOP.  A CRUDE PERFORMANCE TOOL HAS BEEN INCLUDED WITH THIS
DISTRIBUTION.  THIS IS AN ASSEMBLER PROGRAM CALLED "BLDLTEST" IN WHICH
THE USER HARD-CODES A BLDL REQUEST FOR A LIST OF LOAD MODULES OF HIS
OWN CHOICE.  THE CLIST "BT" RUNS THE PROGRAM A GIVEN NUMBER OF TIMES,
AND TAKES CRUDE TIMING STATISTICS.

      YOU ALONE MUST DECIDE IF DYNABLDL XA IS A GOOD TOOL FOR YOUR
XA SYSTEM.  YOU MAY FIND THAT THE DYNABLDL REPORT WHICH SHOWS ALL LOAD
MODULES HIT, MAY OFFSET ANY SLIGHT PERFORMANCE DISADVANTAGES THAT
DYNABLDL XA MAY HAVE AGAINST LLA.  DYNABLDL COMES UP AND DOWN MUCH
MORE QUICKLY THAN LLA, AND MAY ALLOW BETTER PERFORMANCE ON A SYSTEM
WITH REAL STORAGE CONSTRAINTS, BECAUSE ITS TABLE OCCUPIES VERY FEW
PAGES, AS COMPARED TO LLA'S TABLE.

      PLEASE LOOK AT MEMBER "SYNCNOTE" FROM DAVE ANDREWS.

      ONLY THREE VERSIONS OF DYNABLDL RECOGNITION CODE HAVE THUS FAR
BEEN CODED FOR XA LEVELS OF IGC018.  THERE ARE MANY OTHER XA LEVELS
OF IGC018 IN CIRCULATION.  RECOGNITION CODE FOR IGC018 IS BUILT INTO
DYNABLDL SOURCE CODE, SO DYNABLDL RECOGNIZES THE VERSION OF THE BLDL
SVC IGC018 THAT YOU ARE RUNNING.  TO ADD ADDITIONAL RECOGNITION CODE,
YOU NEED MICROFICHE FOR THE LEVEL OF IGC018 THAT YOU ARE RUNNING.  I
AM INCLUDING A FEW HELPFUL HINTS FOR FITTING RECOGNITION CODE TO YOUR
IGC018.  THESE ARE IN MEMBER $RECOGN.  IF YOUR IGC018 IS KNOWN ALREADY
TO DYNABLDL, YOU NEED ONLY ASSEMBLE AND LINKEDIT THE PROGRAM, TURN OFF
LLA, ADD THE VARIOUS DYNABLDL PROCS TO SYS1.PROCLIB, AND START THE
DYNABLDL PROC.  IF YOU SUCCESSFULLY CODE DYNABLDL RECOGNITION CODE
FOR ANOTHER VERSION OF IGC018, KINDLY SEND YOUR CODE TO SAM GOLOB
AT NEWSWEEK, INC., 333 ROUTE 46 WEST, MOUNTAIN LAKES, NJ 07046, OR TO
ARNOLD CASINGHINO AT CBT.  THIS WAY, OTHER PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO
REINVENT THE WHEEL.

      THE XA UPGRADE WAS DONE BY JOHN WILLIAMS OF WESTERN UNION/EDS
OF MAHWAH, NEW JERSEY.  THE CHANGE CONSISTED OF MAKING SURE THE AMODE
WAS 31, AND TURNING OFF XA PAGE PROTECTION WHILE INSERTING AND
REMOVING DYNABLDL'S HOOKS INTO IGC018.  THIS WAS NECESSARY BECAUSE
IGC018 IS LOADED INTO THE READ-ONLY NUCLEUS AREA ABOVE THE 16M LINE IN
AN XA SYSTEM.  SOME ASSISTANCE WAS PROVIDED BY JEFF BROIDO OF BROIDO
COMPUTER CONSULTING.  SAM GOLOB OF NEWSWEEK MERGED IN HIS CODE TO
OPTIONALLY EXCLUDE CERTAIN LINKLIST LIBRARIES THAT YOU MAY NOT WANT
DYNABLDL TO RECOGNIZE.

         CURRENTLY SUPPORTED XA VERSIONS OF IGC018    (AS OF 10/24/90)
