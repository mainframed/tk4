Hi Sam,

This will describe how I use TRACE390.

Being an assembler consultant working at mostly COBOL clients, I cannot
guarantee there will be any assembler debugging tools available, so
TRACE390 is used mostly as a poor man's debugger.

In most case I can isolate where a problem is occurring but sometimes
cannot see why. I invoke TRACE390 at a point close to where I believe
the problem is occurring and single step thru the output until I see it
do something unexpected.

Since the source is available, you can customize it to work for
specialized problems. One example of this is the watchpoint feature I
added when I had a problem where I knew what was being altered, but had
no clue who was doing it. Watchpoints allow you to specify a storage
location (address and length) and have an exit invoked whenever that
storage is about to be updated.  By activating TRACE390, but suppressing
the output until the exit detects the storage alteration, you can avoid
generating millions of lines of output before the problem is
encountered.

Due to the potentially large amount of output TRACE390 can produce, I
mostly use it to analyze strange but repeatable problems in assembler
programs.

Hope this helps,
Robert
