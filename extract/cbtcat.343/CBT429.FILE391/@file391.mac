//***FILE 391 is from Robert Ngan and is an assembler level         *
//*           instruction tracing program called TRACE390.          *
//*                                                                 *
//*           Documentation for this program is in member           *
//*           $DOCTRAC.  Member $EXTRACE, which contains a sample   *
//*           of the output of this program, is in TSO XMIT         *
//*           format, which becomes a sequential file with          *
//*           RECFM=FB, LRECL=133, after TSO RECEIVE is done        *
//*           to it, as the INDSN dataset name.                     *
//*                                                                 *
//*           Member $TRACDOC is in Word 97 format.  In order to    *
//*           read it, download it "binary" RECFM=FB,LRECL=80       *
//*           to a pc, and it should be readable.  I tried it,      *
//*           and it was ok.                                        *
