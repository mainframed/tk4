*
* PURPOSE:
*
*  J011SPRT IS A SPOOL PARTITIONING EXIT DESIGNED TO WORK FROM EXIT 11
*  THIS EXIT WILL TELL JES TO TRY TO USE ONLY TRACK GROUPS ON THE SPOOL
*  VOLUMES THAT ARE DESIGNATED IN THE SPLTBL (SPOOL TABLE) FOR SYSLOG
*  AND STARTED TASKS.
*
* ENVIRONMENT: JES2 MAIN TASK
*
* POINT OF PROCESSING: THIS EXIT IS TAKEN FROM THE JES2 MAIN TASK,
*                      FROM THE $TRACK SUBROUTINE IN HASPTRAK,
*                      WHEN THERE IS NO SPACE AVAILABLE ON THE SPOOL
*                      VOLUMES FROM WHICH THE CURRENT JOB IS PERMITTED
*                      TO ALLOCATE SPACE.
*
* METHOD USED:
*
*  WHEN EXIT IS ENTERED, A CHECK IS MADE TO SEE IF JOB IS A STARTED
*  TASK OR ANYTHING OTHER THAN A JOB OR TSO SESSION. IF NOT, SET RC=0.
*  IF IT IS, THEN ZERO OUT THE JCTSAMSK (SPOOL PARTITIONING MASK -
*  ACTUALLY THE MASK WORK AREA FOR THIS EXIT).  GO THROUGH SPLTBL
*  AND DAS ENTRIES TO FIND MATCHES.  ONCE A MATCH IS FOUND, CHECK TO
*  SEE IF THE SPOOL IS SUITABLE FOR USE.  IF SO, "OR" THE DASMASK ONTO
*  THE MASK WORK AREA AND GET THE NEXT ENTRY IN SPLTBL.  IF THE SPOOL
*  VOLUME IS NOT AVAILABLE, SKIP THIS PARTICULAR SPLTBL ENTRY AND GET
*  ANOTHER.  ONCE THE LIST FROM SPLTBL HAS BEEN EXHAUSTED, RETURN
*  CONTROL TO JES WTIH RC=8, TELLING JES THAT AN UPDATED VERSION OF
*  THE SPOOL PARTITIONING MASK - WITH AT LEAST ONE ADDITIONAL BIT
*  TURNED ON - HAS BEEN PASSED TO JES IN THE SPOOL MASK WORK AREA
*  AND WILL NOW DETERMINE SUBSEQUENT SPOOL ALLOCATION.  IT ALSO TELLS
*  JES TO REISSUE THE $TRACK REQUEST.  IF NO MATCH IS FOUND, THE MASK
*  WORK AREA IS LEFT UNALTERED (SET TO IOTSAMSK FIELD AS ON ENTRY) AND
*  RC=0 TELLS JES TO SET THE SPOOL PARTITIONING MASK AS INDICATED
*  BY THE FENCE PARAMETER ON THE SPOOLDEF INITIALIZATION STATEMENT
*  AND TO REISSUE THE $TRACK REQUEST.
