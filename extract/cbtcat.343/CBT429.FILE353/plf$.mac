    CONCATENATION. "PAM" AND "ISPLINK" MUST BE AVAILABLE IN THE SYSLIB
    CONCATENATION FOR THE LINK-EDIT STEP.

    PLF IS NOT RE-ENTRANT AND NOT REUSEABLE (MOSTLY DUE TO "PAM").

    NOTE: PLF CAN BE INVOKED ONLY AS AN SPF APPLICATION; YOU CANNOT

          FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS, YOU WILL GET AN 0C1 OR 0C4.
