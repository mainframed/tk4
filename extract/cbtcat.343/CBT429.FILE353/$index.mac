   APPLMON$ - INSTALL DOC FOR APPLMON

              APPLMON IS A VTAM APPLICATION MONITOR. IT PROVIDES A MULTI
              USER INTERFACE TO NATIVE VTAM APPLICATIONS. IT PROVIDES A
              FULL-SCREEN LOGON PANEL, A PRIMARY OPTION PANEL, AND 4
              SAMPLE APPLICATIONS. EACH USER THAT LOGS ON RUNS UNDER A
              SEPARATE TCB; THE NUMBER OF USERS THAT COULD BE SUPPORTED
              IN ONE ADDRESS SPACE IS DEPENDENT ON REGION SIZE.

              NOTE: THIS WAS CODED AS PART OF A VTAM CODING COURSE.
                    IT IS NOT-NOT-NOT INTENDED FOR ANY SORT OF
                    PRODUCTION USE.


   CDF$     - INSTALL DOC FOR MVS SP 1.3 CONSOLE DISPLAY FACILITY (CDF)

              THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES THE ISPF/PDF USER WITH A DISPLAY OF
              THE MASTER CONSOLE. OPERATOR COMMANDS ARE ENTERED ON THE
              STANDARD "COMMAND INPUT" LINE; PF3 GETS YOU OUT. SECURITY
              IS BASED ON THE TSO USERID, SEE THE CODE FOR CUSTOMIZATION
              INFO. YOU HAVE TO HIT "ENTER" TO REFRESH THE DISPLAY. YOU
              MUST ADJUST THE LINE COUNT BASED ON THE MASTER CONSOLE'S
              TERMINAL TYPE.

   DIF      - ISPF/PDF DISPLAY INITIATORS FACILITY (DIF)--PART OF JDF.

   ETPS$    - INSTALL DOC FOR EMERGENCY TELE-PROCESSING SERVICES (ETPS).

              THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES SOME BASIC TIME-SHARING SERVICES
              WHEN TSO OR SPF IS UNAVAILABLE. IF YOU DEFINE IT AS A
              SUB-SYSTEM, IT CAN BE (AND HAS BEEN, TO MY GREAT RELIEF)
              BROUGHT UP EVEN WHEN JES2 ABENDS, OR WILL NOT INITIALIZE.

              THE BASIC PROCESSING APPEARS MUCH LIKE SPF, AS FAR AS
              THE PRIMARY OPTION MENU AND SO FORTH ARE CONCERNED. THE
              FULL-SCREEN EDITOR IS QUITE PRIMITIVE, BUT SHOULD SUFFICE
              FOR EMERGENCY USE. TUBE I/O IS EXCP, SO YOU DON'T NEED
              BTAM, TCAM, OR VTAM/TCAS.

              THE PRIMARY OPTION MENU HAS 4 OPTIONS:
                          1. PDS BROWSE
                          2. PDS EDIT
                          3. PDS UTILITY
                          4. IDCAMS INTERFACE

              TERMINALS SUPPORTED ARE 3278-2, 3278-4, 3279-3B. INSTALL
              AND USER DOC ARE IN COMMENTS IN THE CODE, AS WELL AS IN
              MEMBER "ETPS$" IN THIS DATASET.

              A NUMBER OF ENHANCEMENTS AND FIXES ARE INCLUDED IN THIS
              VERSION, WHICH IS INDICATED AS 2.4 ON THE PRIMARY OPTION
              MENU. TO INSTALL UNDER XA, JUST RE-ASSEMBLE USING THE
              XA MACLIB AND AMODGEN. NO SOURCE CHANGES ARE REQUIRED.

              WARNING: THE BUGS ARE NOT ALL OUT OF THIS BABY, SO DO
                       SOME TESTING BEFORE YOU BET THE FARM ON IT.

   JDF$     - INSTALL DOC FOR ISPF/PDF JES2 DISPLAY FACILITY (JDF)

              THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES THE ISPF/PDF USER WITH A DISPLAY OF
              THE JES2 SPOOL, SIMILAR TO THE FAMOUS "QUEUE" COMMAND.

              REQUIRES MY MODIFIED UAL JES2 INTERFACE SVC AND JES2
              HJE2330.


              WARNING: THERE IS SOME INSTALLATION-DEPENDENT CODE HERE,
                       SO YOU MAY HAVE TO TINKER WITH IT.



   JDFMACS  - A SET OF MACROS THAT GENERATE JDF DSECTS.

   PLF$     - INSTALL DOC FOR ISPF/PDF PAN LIBRARY FACILITY (PLF)

              THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES THE ISPF/PDF USER WITH A DISPLAY OF
              A PAN LIBRARY, WITH THE ABILITY TO BROWSE AND EDIT FROM
              A MEMBER LIST. THIS IS BASED IN PART ON THE "PANVIEW"
              PROGRAM ON THE SHARE SPLA TAPE (I THINK). IT'S NOT NEARLY
              AS GOOD AS THE PAN/SPF PRODUCT, OR SO I'M TOLD, BUT THIS
              IS A LOT CHEAPER.


   SMBROWSE - SPF MEMORY BROWSE PROGRAM, INVOKED WITH A PARAMETER LIST
              POINTING TO AN AREA OF MEMORY. PROVIDES A LOW-OVERHEAD
              BROWSE THAT CAN BE INVOKED FROM ISPF APPLICATIONS. USED
              IN JDF.

   SPFMACS  - A SET OF MACROS TO INVOKE ISPF SERVICES.

   TCBUVTAM - A MACRO THAT GENERATES A DSECT USED BY ETPS. THIS IS FOR
              A FUTURE ENHANCEMENT.

   VDF$     - INSTALL DOC FOR ISPF/PDF VTOC DISPLAY FACILITY (VDF)

              THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES THE ISPF/PDF USER WITH A DISPLAY OF
              ALL OR SELECTED ONLINE DASD VOLUMES. THE DISPLAY USES THE
              LSPACE SVC, SO IT DOESN'T HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION ON
              EACH PACK.

              BECAUSE OF THE SIMPLICITY OF THE PROGRAM, THIS MAY BE A
              GOOD PROGRAM TO SWIPE CODE FROM, IF YOU ARE WRITING YOUR
              FIRST ISPF APPLICATION.

   XDF$     - INSTALL DOC FOR ISPF/PDF EXECUTION DISPLAY FACILITY (XDF)

              THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES THE ISPF/PDF USER WITH A DISPLAY OF
              ACTIVE JOBS AND STARTED TASKS, BASED ON "CHIMP", UPDATED
              FOR SP 2.1.3.

   GENERAL NOTE: SOME OF THE PROGRAMS REFERENCE THE CVTUSER FIELD IN THE
                 CVT. AT OUR INSTALLATION, WE USE THAT FIELD TO POINT TO
                 SOME INSTALLATION-SPECIFIC TABLES. FOR THE MOST PART,
                 YOU CAN JUST DELETE THOSE REFERENCES, BUT YOU DO NEED
                 TO REVIEW THEM.
