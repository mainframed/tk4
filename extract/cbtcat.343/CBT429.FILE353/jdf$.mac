 1. COPY INTO YOUR ISPPLIB:

               JDFDAHLP
               JDFDATAB
               JDFDDHLP
               JDFDDTAB
               JDFDSHLP
               JDFDSTAB
               JDFHELP
               JDFOPT
               JDFREPR
               JDFREPRH
               JDFRMT
               JDFRMTH
               SMBP1
               SMBH1

 3. COPY JDF00 AND SMB00 INTO YOUR ISPMLIB.

 4. CHECK THE SOURCE CODE FOR CUSTOMIZATION TO FIT YOUR JES2 SYSTEM.

    JDF WAS WRITTEN TO SATISFY OUR INSTALLATION REQUIREMENTS. AS FAR
    AS I KNOW, IT CAN BE INSTALLED AND USED AS A GENERAL-PURPOSE JES
    INTERFACE. HOWEVER, I CANNOT TELL IF IT WILL DO THE JOB AT YOUR
    INSTALLATION.

    JDF HAS BEEN TESTED ONLY WITH A "PURE-VANILLA", UNMODIFIED JES2;
    IF YOU HAVE MODIFICATIONS ON YOUR JES, JDF MAY NOT WORK. THE JES
    LEVEL IS SP1.3.4 (SP 2.1.3), FMID HJE2330.

    NO WARRANTY IS EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED.

 5. SUBMIT AN ASSEMBLY OF JDF. IT DOES NOT NEED TO GO INTO ANY SPECIAL
    LIBRARY, BUT IT MUST BE ACCESSABLE FROM YOUR TSO SESSION. IT IS
    RE-ENTRANT, AND MAY GO INTO LPALIB. ALSO ASSEMBLE "QSAMPUT".

    TO USE THE JDF INTERNAL BROWSE (DSID SELECTION OPTION "S") YOU
    WILL ALSO NEED TO ASSEMBLE "SMBROWSE".

    NOTE: DO NOT STRIP OFF THE ASSEMBLY AND LINK-EDIT JCL WITHOUT
          LOOKING AT IT; IT IS INCLUDED FOR A REASON. ASSEMBLER H
          WITH THE "BATCH" OPTION IS REQUIRED. THIS LIBRARY CONTAINS
          2 COPY ELEMENTS THAT MUST BE AVAILABLE FOR ASSEMBLY (JDFMACS
          AND SPFMACS). THE LINKEDIT STEP MUST PULL IN ISPLINK.


 6. MODIFY AN EXISTING SPF SCREEN TO INVOKE THE JDF PROGRAM. A SAMPLE
    IS:

    IN THE BODY==>              % J +JES2 DISPLAY FACILITY

    IN THE PROC==>              J,'PGM(JDF)'


 7. YOU NEED TO HAVE THE JES2 SVC FROM UAL, HEAVILY MODIFIED, AND
    INCLUDED HERE AS JDFSVC. AS IS, THE SVC WILL BE INSTALLED AS
    SVC 237 (IGC0023G). IF YOU NEED TO CHANGE THE SVC NUMBER, BE SURE
    YOU CHANGE THE JDF CODE.

    I STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT YOU USE 237, IF POSSIBLE.

    NOTE: DO NOT STRIP OFF THE ASSEMBLY AND LINK-EDIT JCL WITHOUT
          LOOKING AT IT; IT IS INCLUDED FOR A REASON. ASSEMBLER H
          WITH THE "BATCH" OPTION IS REQUIRED. THIS LIBRARY CONTAINS
          1 COPY ELEMENT THAT MUST BE AVAILABLE FOR ASSEMBLY, JDFMACS.

          ALSO, SYS1.HASPSRC IS REQUIRED FOR THE JES MACROS.
          THE JES2 LEVEL MUST BE HJE2330.



 8.  NOTE THAT XDF, CDF, AND DIF CAN ALL BE INVOKED FROM THIS PROGRAM,
     SO YOU MAY WANT TO INSTALL THEM AT THE SAME TIME. ("CDF" ALSO
     USES THE JDF SVC.) THESE PROGRAMS ARE DOCUMENTED ELSEWHERE IN
     THIS LIBRARY.

 9.  GENERAL INFO:

     1. THE JDF SVC IS RELEASE-DEPENDENT. IT PROVIDES AN INTERFACE ONLY
        FOR JES2 1.3.4. EARLIER JES RELEASES WILL NOT WORK.


     2. JDF REQUIRES THE ISPF/PDF PROGRAM PRODUCT. EARLIER SPF/ISPF
        RELEASES WILL NOT WORK. (I BELIEVE YOU GET AN ABEND S0C1.)


     3. INSTALLATION OF THE JDF SVC IS NOT OPTIONAL; IT MUST BE
        INSTALLED IN LPALIB, AN SVC NUMBER DEFINED BY AN I/O GEN,
        AND THE SYSTEM MUST BE IPL'ED WITH CLPA.

        IF YOU DO NOT DO THIS, YOU WILL GET AN ABEND S0C1.

        (JDF ITSELF DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY PARTICULAR RELEASE OF JES,
         BUT IT WON'T WORK WITHOUT THE SVC.)


     4. AT OUR INSTALLATION, TSO USER-ID'S ARE 5 CHARACTERS. I THINK
        I HAVE REMOVED ALL LENGTH DEPENDENCIES, BUT I AM NOT SURE.


     5. AT OUR INSTALLATION, THE FIRST 2 CHARACTERS OF THE USER-ID ARE
        USED TO IDENTIFY THE DEPARTMENT. IN THE "AUTH" CHECKING, THIS
        IS REFERENCED ALL OVER THE PLACE. SEE WARNING, ABOVE.


     6. WE DO JOB ACCESS AUTHORITY CHECKING BASED ON ACF2 RULES. THIS
        REQUIRES THE ACFCHECK SVC, IGC0024G. TO SET UP THE ACF2 RULES,
        SEE MEMBER "JDFRULES".


     7. IF YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEMS WITH INSTALLING JDF, CHECK THE STEPS
        ABOVE; IF YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING WRONG, CALL ME (BRIAN COOK) AT
        (312) 807-2466.


     8. MEMBER "JDFUSER" IN THIS LIBRARY IS A USER MANUAL. IT IS IN
        BOTH UPPER AND LOWER-CASE, AND WAS INTENDED TO BE PRINTED
        USING ROTATE90 ON A 3800.
