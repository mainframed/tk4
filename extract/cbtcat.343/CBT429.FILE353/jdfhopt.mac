%-----------------------JES2 DISPLAY FACILITY  (JDF)  ------------------
+
+  JDF IS AN IN-HOUSE WRITTEN SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES A JES INQUIRY FACILIT
+  FROM TSO. YOU CAN LOOK AT THE STATUS OF ALL JOBS IN THE SYSTEM
+  AND GET DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THE TEST JOBS THAT YOU
+  HAVE SUBMITTED. YOU CAN ALSO VIEW ANY REPORT FILES ONLINE FROM YOUR
+  JOBS.
+
+  THE JOBS ARE ALWAYS SHOWN IN JES2 SELECTION PRIORITY SEQUENCE. THIS
+  IS OBVIOUSLY IRRELEVANT FOR JOBS THAT ARE EXECUTING, BUT FOR JOBS ON
+  INPUT OR OUTPUT QUEUES, THE ORDER OF THE LIST SHOWS YOU WHICH JOBS
+  WILL BE SELECTED FOR EXECUTION OR PRINTING FIRST.
+
+  THE OUTLIST DATASET IS THE NAME OF A STANDARD TSO DATASET WHICH WILL
+  BE USED FOR BROWSING INDIVIDUAL REPORTS ON THE SPOOL. IF YOU PRE-
+  ALLOCATE THE DATASET, THE LRECL WILL BE USED, AND RECORDS WILL BE
+  TRUNCATED IF NECESSARY.
+
+  The "DW" option shows Job Output Elements (JOE's) that are queue'd to
+  an external writer. This is normally an IDTF transmission that has no
+  been RECEIVE'd.
