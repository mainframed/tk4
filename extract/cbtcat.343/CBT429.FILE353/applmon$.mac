                 APPLMON  INSTALLATION (ACF/VTAM V2)

    **                        N O T E  !
    **
    **  1. APPLMON WAS WRITTEN AS A CODING EXERCISE; IT HAS NOT BEEN
    **     THOROUGHLY TESTED, AND HAS NEVER BEEN USED NOR INTENDED TO
    **     BE USED IN A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT.
    **
    **
    **  2. APPLMON CAN PROVIDE MULTIPLE USERS WITH ACCESS TO NATIVE
    **     VTAM APPLICATIONS IN ONE ADDRESS SPACE. EACH USER LOGGED
    **     ON TO THE SYSTEM RUNS UNDER A SEPARATE TCB. "SEND" AND
    **     "RECEIVE" PROCESSING IS ALWAYS SYNCHRONOUS.
    **
    **
    **  3. THE ONLY APPLICATIONS THAT CAN BE RUN UNDER APPLMON ARE
    **     THOSE CODED SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS SYSTEM. SOME SAMPLE
    **     APPLICATIONS ARE INCLUDED, JUST TO ILLUSTRATE HOW TO DO IT.
    **
    **
    **  4. I REALLY CAN'T THINK OF ANY REASON TO USE THIS, AS IS. IT
    **     MAY BE USEFUL TO LOOK AT, IF YOU FIND A NEED TO DO SOMETHING
    **     OF THIS NATURE FOR SOME SPECIAL APPLICATION.

    *****************************************************************


 1. UPDATE YOUR VTAMLST WITH APPLICATION DEFINITIONS PER "APPLDEF".
    REMEMBER, IF YOU JUST UPDATE AN EXISTING MEMBER, BE SURE TO DELETE
    IT FROM VTAMOBJ BEFORE RESTARTING VTAM.


 2. CREATE A PROC THAT CAN BE STARTED FROM THE CONSOLE, PER "APPLJOB".
    THE JCL SUPPLIED USES A STEPLIB; APPLMON MUST BE AUTHORIZED AND RUN
    FROM AN AUTHORIZED LIBRARY, SO YOU MAY WANT TO PUT IT IN A LNKLST
    LIBRARY, INSTEAD.

    YOU CAN ALSO RUN THE JCL AS A BATCH JOB.


 3. SUBMIT AN ASSEMBLY OF APPLMON. IT NEEDS A DSECT "TCBUVTAM" FROM
    THIS LIBRARY. THIS IS THE MAIN PROGRAM. NOTE THAT IT MUST BE
    AUTHORIZED, AND BE IN AN AUTHORIZED LOAD LIBRARY.

    SEE THE CODE FOR A DESCRIPTION OF WHAT IT DOES.


 4. SUBMIT AN ASSEMBLY OF APPLOGO. IT NEEDS A DSECT "TCBUVTAM" FROM
    THIS LIBRARY. THIS IS THE "ATTACH"ED TASK PROGRAM. IT SHOULD GO
    INTO THE SAME LIBRARY AS APPLMON, ABOVE.

    THIS PROGRAM DISPLAYS THE LOGON MENU, INVOKES THE PASSWORD
    EXIT, AND DISPLAYS THE PRIMARY OPTION MENU.


 5. SUBMIT AN ASSEMBLY OF APPLXIT. IT NEEDS A DSECT "TCBUVTAM" FROM
    THIS LIBRARY. THIS IS THE PASSWORD/USER VALIDATION EXIT. AS SHIPPED,
    IT IS JUST A SKELETON, AND ALLOWS ANYONE TO LOG ON.

    IF YOU WERE TO USE APPLMON WITH ANY FREQUENCY, SOME SORT OF USERID
    AND PASSWORD CHECKING SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE EXIT.

    IT SHOULD BE LINK-EDIT'ED INTO THE SAME LIBRARY AS APPLMON, ABOVE.

 6. ASSEMBLE THE SAMPLE APPLICATIONS:

    APPLOPR  ==>  PROVIDES A CONSOLE DISPLAY SIMILAR TO "CDF".
    APPLPGM  ==>  INVOKES "ETPS".
    APPLSAD  ==>  A SYSTEM ACTIVITY DISPLAY BASED ON "CHIMP".
    APPLSPO  ==>  A VTAM SECONDARY OPERATOR.

    THESE SHOULD BE LINK-EDIT'ED INTO THE SAME LIBRARY AS APPLMON.
    THEY ALL NEED THE "TCBUVTAM" DSECT FROM THIS LIBRARY.

    NOTE: "APPLOPR" AND "APPLSAD" HAVE NOT BEEN UPDATED FOR XA.


 7. IF YOU HAVE RACF, YOU SHOULD UPDATE ICHRIN03 WITH THE STARTED
    TASK NAME. OR, YOU CAN RUN IT AS A BATCH JOB. IF YOU HAVE ACF2,
    RUNNING AS A BATCH JOB IS PROBABLY YOUR SAFEST BET. THERE IS NO
    AUTHORITY CHECKING PROVIDED INTERNALLY.


 8. VARY ACT THE APPL DEFINITION ON VTAM AND START THE APPLMON PROC,
    OR SUBMIT THE BATCH JOB.


 9. FROM A VTAM TERMINAL, ENTER:    LOGON APPLID(APPLMON)
    YOU SHOULD GET THE LOGON PANEL. JUST FILL IN THE BLANKS AND HIT
    ENTER. FROM THE PRIMARY OPTION MENU, SELECT THE DESIRED SAMPLE
    APPLICATION. TO GET OUT, JUST KEEP HITTING PF3. PF3 ON THE LOGON
    PANEL RETURNS YOU TO VTAM.
