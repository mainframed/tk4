   INSTALLATION STEPS:


 1. SUBMIT AN ASSEMBLY OF ETPS. IT MUST BE MARKED AUTHORIZED AND MUST
    BE PLACED IN AN AUTHORIZED LIBRARY. ETPS MODULES REQUIRE
    2 COPY ELEMENTS ON THIS LIBRARY, "ETPSMACS" AND "TCBUVTAM".

    I STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT YOU PUT ETPS IN SYS1.LINKLIB. WHY? BECAUSE
    THERE IS LITTLE POINT IN AN EMERGENCY RECOVERY SYSTEM THAT DEPENDS
    ON ALL OF YOUR LNKLST OR APF LIBRARIES BEING AVAILABLE--THAT MAY BE
    THE PROBLEM YOU ARE TRYING TO RECOVER FROM.

    SUBMIT ASSEMBLIES FOR:

         ETPSBRO3 -- BROWSE
         ETPSCOMP -- FOREGROUND COMPRESS
         ETPSEDT3 -- EDITOR
         ETPSIDC2 -- IDCAMS INTERFACE
         ETPSMEMC -- FOREGROUND MEMBER COPY
         ETPSTSO  -- TSO COMMAND PROCESSOR FRONT-END



    NOTE: DO NOT STRIP OFF THE ASSEMBLY AND LINK-EDIT JCL WITHOUT
          LOOKING AT IT; IT IS INCLUDED FOR YOUR REFERENCE. NOTE
          AUTHORIZATION REQUIREMENTS, LINK-EDIT ATTRIBUTES, ETC.


 2. CREATE A PROC TO INVOKE ETPS AS A SUB-SYSTEM. YOU MUST PUT IT IN
    SYS1.PROCLIB (ON YOUR IPL VOLUME, I TRUST). FOR EXAMPLE:

     //ETPS PROC TRM1=ETPS34AB
     //* DEFAULT IS 3279 MOD3 NEXT TO MVS MASTER CONSOLE
     //ETPS EXEC PGM=ETPS,PARM=&TRM1,PERFORM=3,TIME=1440


    THE FORMAT OF THE PARM FIELD IS DISCUSSED BELOW. AS A GENERAL
    RULE, YOU SHOULD SELECT A DEFAULT TERMINAL THAT IS NEAR TO THE
    MVS MASTER CONSOLE. AN MCS  CONSOLE CAN BE USED, BUT IT MUST
    BE GEN'ED AS A 3278/9 AND VARY'ED OFF AS A CONSOLE AND THEN ON.
    THIS IS SOMETHING YOU CAN EASILY FORGET TO DO WHEN YOU ARE IN PANIC
    MODE, SO SHOULD PROBABLY BE AVOIDED, IF POSSIBLE.


    NOTE: ETPS HAS BEEN TESTED ONLY WITH LOCAL NON-SNA IBM 3270'S. I
          HAVE NO ACCESS TO OTHER TERMINAL TYPES. THE ONLY MODELS I
          CAN TEST WITH ARE 3278-2, 3278-4, AND 3279-3B.
1


 3. CREATE A PROC TO INVOKE ETPS AS A NORMAL STARTED TASK. PUT IT IN
    SYS1.PROCLIB, PREFERABLY. FOR EXAMPLE:


     //ETPSJOB PROC TRM1=ETPS34AB
     //* DEFAULT IS 3279 MOD3 NEXT TO MVS MASTER CONSOLE
     //ETPS EXEC PGM=ETPS,PARM=&TRM1,PERFORM=3,TIME=1440


    THE SECOND PROC IS JUST IN CASE JES HAS COME UP, SO THAT YOU
    CAN SUBMIT BATCH JOBS, BUT THE REST OF THE SYSTEM MAY BE NOT BE
    "UP" FAR ENOUGH TO ALLOW YOU TO LOG ONTO TSO.

    YOU CANNOT SUBMIT BATCH JOBS TO JES WHEN RUNNING AS A SUB-SYSTEM.
    (WELL, IT AIN'T EASY, AND ETPS DOESN'T DO IT.)

 4. IF YOU WANT TO RUN ETPS UNDER TSO, INSTALL THE PROGRAM "ETPSTSO"
    ON THIS TAPE INTO A LIBRARY AVAILABLE TO YOUR TSO SESSION.

    WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THIS?

    ONE REASON IS THAT ETPS IS INTENDED TO BE USED IN EMERGENCIES;
    DO YOU REALLY WANT TO WAIT UNTIL THEN TO START BECOMING FAMILIAR
    WITH YOUR RECOVERY TOOLS? WHEN THE SYSTEM IS IN THE BAG, I DON'T
    WANT TO LEARN THE QUIRKS OF A TP SYSTEM, I MAINLY WANT TO GET THE
    SYSTEM BACK UP. I SUGGEST A FEW MINUTES WITH THE EDITOR MIGHT BE
    USEFUL FOR BASIC FAMILIARIZATION.


 5. DEFINE "ETPS" AS A SUB-SYSTEM. IT IS NOT ACTUALLY A SUB-SYSTEM,
    BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER AS LONG AS MVS THINKS IT IS. YOU CAN
    EITHER UPDATE YOUR SYSGEN, ZAP IT INTO YOUR SUB-SYSTEM NAMES
    TABLE, OR AS I DO, PUT IT IN "SYS1.PARMLIB(IEFSSN01)".


 6. UPDATE YOUR SECURITY SYSTEM. WE HAVE RACF, AND ETPS IS DEFINED TO
    BE ABLE TO ALTER ALL "SYS1" STUFF, AND ALSO HAS "SPECIAL". I DON'T
    KNOW WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE TO DO FOR ACF2, OR THE OTHER SYSTEMS.

    BE SURE TO ADD BOTH STARTED TASK NAMES TO ICHRIN03, IF YOU HAVE RACF

    NOTE: SINCE WRITING THE ABOVE, WE HAVE REMOVED RACF, AND INSTALLED
          ACF2. WE DO NOT CHECK SECURITY IN STARTED TASKS, HOWEVER, SO
          I CAN'T PROVIDE ANY FURTHER GUIDELINES.


 7. I STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT YOU TEST THIS ON STAND-ALONE TIME. ONE
    INSTALLATION TRIED ETPS DURING THE DAY, LOST THEIR CONSOLES
    AND HAD TO RE-IPL. OTHERS HAVE HAD NO PROBLEMS.

    CHECK IT OUT FOR YOURSELF.

 8. IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS IN INSTALLING OR USING ETPS, CALL:

                        GENERAL DESCRIPTION

 ********************************************************************

   FUNCTION-

   THIS PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE EMERGENCY TELE-PROCESSING
   SERVICES WHEN THE NORMAL SUBSYSTEMS SUCH AS JES2, VTAM, TCAM, ETC
   ARE NOT AVAILABLE. IT IS INTENDED TO BE INVOKED AS A STARTED TASK,
   AND IT MUST BE DEFINED AS A SECONDARY SUBSYSTEM IN ORDER
   TO BE ABLE TO START WHEN JES2 IS NOT AVAILABLE.


   PARM -

   THIS PROGRAM MUST BE INVOKED WITH A STANDARD EXECUTE-CARD FORMAT
   PARM. THE LENGTH MUST BE 8 BYTES, AS FOLLOWS:

      1. THE FIRST 4 CHARACTERS MUST BE "ETPS".

      2. THE 5TH BYTE IS TERMINAL TYPE. VALID TERMINAL TYPES ARE:

              2 = 3278 MODEL 2
              A = 3278 MODEL 2A (PER WAYNE MITCHELL)
              3 = 3279 MODEL 3B
              4 = 3278 MODEL 4

      3. THE LAST 3 BYTES MUST BE THE UNIT ADDRESS OF THE TERMINAL.

   AS AN EXAMPLE, //STEP1  EXEC  PGM=ETPS,PARM='ETPS49C4' STARTS
   TIME-SHARING ON A LOCAL 3278  MOD 4 AT ADDR 9C4.


   LOGGING ON AND OFF -

   THE FIRST THING THE PROGRAM DOES IS PROMPT FOR A USER-ID AND
   PASSWORD. THE USER-ID IS COMPARED TO A LIST OF VALID USER-ID'S.
   THIS SHOULD BE CHANGED TO CHECK AGAINST UADS, MAYBE. SEE THE
   "USERTABL" IN THE CODE.

   THE PASSWORD IS NOT CURRENTLY VALIDATED IN ANY WAY, BUT IS USED
   AS THE DEFAULT PASSWORD FOR DATASET ALLOCATIONS.

   THE LOGON MENU LOOKS LIKE:


    ENTER USERID ==>_            (ONLY "BCOOK" IS VALID)
    AND PASSWORD ==>             (DEFAULT DATASET PASSWORD)
      RACF GROUP ==>             (OPTIONAL, SHOULD BE "SYS1")


   IF "LOGON" IS SUCCESSFUL, THE PRIMARY OPTION MENU (AS IN SPF) IS
   DISPLAYED, AND THE USER CAN BEGIN PROCESSING.

   TO SHUT DOWN, ENTER "EOJ" IN THE USER-ID FIELD, OR HIT ANY PFK.
1


   THE PRIMARY OPTION MENU LOOKS LIKE:

   --------------------- ETPS PRIMARY OPTION MENU  ----------------
   SELECT OPTION==>_

    1  BROWSE       - DISPLAY SOURCE DATA
    2  EDIT         - CREATE OR CHANGE SOURCE DATA
    3  UTILITY      - PERFORM ETPS UTILITY FUNCTIONS
    4  IDCAMS       - IDCAMS FOREGROUND PROCESSING

    X  EXIT         - TERMINATE ETPS AND RETURN TO LOGON MENU

    PRESS PFK 3 TO TERMINATE ETPS



    IF OPTION 2 (EDIT) IS SELECTED, AN EDIT MENU IS DISPLAYED:


   --------------------- ETPS EDIT MENU  --------------------------

   ENTER DATASET NAME ==>_
               VOLSER ==>          (IF NOT CATALOGED)
             PASSWORD ==>          (IF PASSWORD-PROTECTED)




    NOTE THAT DATASET NAMES MUST BE ENTERED AS FULLY-QUALIFIED
         NAMES, NOT IN QUOTES.

    NOTE THAT THE OPTION 1 (BROWSE) MENU IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME.


    ALSO, THERE IS A BUG IN THE CODE SUCH THAT YOU CANNOT ENTER
    THE MEMBER NAME IN PARENS. THIS WILL BE FIXED WHEN I GET AROUND
    TO IT.

    ONLY PS AND PO FILES WITH LRECL=80 CAN BE EDIT'ED.

    IF THE DATASET IS A PDS, YOU WILL BE PRESENTED WITH A MEMBER
    LIST. YOU CAN SCROLL UP AND DOWN USING PFK7 AND 8.  A MEMBER
    CAN BE SELECTED FOR EDIT BY ENTERING AN "S" IN THE COLUMN TO
    THE LEFT OF THE MEMBER NAME. THERE IS A  "LOCATE" FUNCTION TO
    POSITION YOURSELF IN THE LIBRARY, SIMILAR TO SPF; JUST TYPE
    L MEM  ON THE COMMAND INPUT LINE.
1





    THE EDITOR IS A VERY PRIMITIVE TOOL. YOU CAN REPEAT LINES,
    DELETE LINES, AND TYPE OVER LINES. YOU CAN COPY A LINE
    AFTER ANOTHER LINE. YOU CAN FIND A STRING OF CHARACTERS AND
    CHANGE IT TO ANOTHER STRING OF CHARACTERS OF THE SAME LENGTH.

    THAT'S IT. THIS IS NOT SPF.

    TO DELETE A LINE, ENTER A "D" IN THE SEQUENCE NUMBER COLUMN AT
    THE LEFT. THERE IS NO "DD" (DELETE RANGE) COMMAND.

    TO REPEAT A LINE, ENTER AN "R" IN THE SEQUENCE NUMBER COLUMN AT
    THE LEFT.  YOU CAN ONLY REPEAT ONE LINE AT A TIME.

    TO COPY A LINE, ENTER A "C" IN THE SEQUENCE NUMBER COLUMN AT
    THE LEFT, AND AN "A" ON THE LINE YOU WANT TO COPY IT AFTER.

    YOU CAN TYPE OVER ANY OR ALL LINES ON THE SCREEN, BUT I HAVE NOT
    TESTED MIXING THIS WITH "D" AND "R" LINE COMMANDS, SO WATCH IT.

    SCROLLING UP AND DOWN IS ACCOMPLISHED BY PF7 AND 8, AS IS USUAL,
    AND THE NUMBER OF LINES CAN BE ENTERED IN THE COMMAND LINE. ALSO
    "M" IS MAX, FOR TOP AND BOTTOM.


    TO SEARCH FOR A CHARACTER STRING, ENTER "F " ON THE COMMAND LINE
    AND ENTER THE CHARACTER STRING ON THE "FIND STRING" LINE. IF
    THE STRING HAS LEADING OR TRAILING BLANKS OR SINGLE QUOTES, YOU
    HAVE TO PUT THE WHOLE SHOT IN SINGLE QUOTES. (PF5 IS FIND/RFIND)

    THE "FIND STRING" LINE ALSO HAS A "CHANGE TO" AREA. THIS IS USED
    TO CHANGE THE FIND STRING TO SOME OTHER STRING OF CHARACTERS. AT
    PRESENT, BOTH STRINGS MUST BE THE SAME LENGTH. TO CHANGE A STRING
    OF CHARACTERS, BOTH THE "FIND" AND "CHANGE" AREAS MUST BE FILLED
    IN; THEN ENTER "C" ON THE COMMAND LINE OR PRESS PF KEY 6. YOU CAN
    CHANGE ONLY ONE OCCURENCE OF THE "FIND STRING" AT A TIME, THERE IS
    NO "CHANGE ALL" COMMAND AS YET. 24 CHARACTERS IS THE MAXIMUM THAT
    CAN BE SPECIFIED.

    NOTE THAT "SAVE" IS THE DEFAULT, WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE CHANGED
         ANY CARDS IN THE MEMBER, SO ENTER "CANCEL" ON THE COMMAND
         LINE IF YOU DON'T WANT THIS TO HAPPEN. (SEE PF KEYS BELOW)
1


    TO SUBMIT THE JCL STREAM YOU ARE EDITING, JUST TYPE "SUB" ON
    THE COMMAND LINE; THE JES2 JOB NUMBER WILL APPEAR IN THE MESSAGE
    AREA IN THE UPPER-RIGHT CORNER OF THE SCREEN. NOTE THAT IF YOU
    ARE RUNNING AS A SUB-SYSTEM, YOU CANNOT SUBMIT JOBS. FOR THAT
    REASON, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE 2 PROC'S IN SYS1.PROCLIB--ONE
    DEFINED AS A SUB-SYSTEM IN IEFSSN01, AND ONE NOT SO DEFINED.
    YOU SHOULD START THE SUB-SYSTEM IF JES IS NOT UP, AND START THE
    OTHER IF YOU WILL NEED TO SUBMIT BATCH JOBS.

    ETPS DOES NOT INVOKE THE TSO SUBMIT EXIT, SO IF YOU HAVE ANY
    SPECIAL HANDLING THERE, JUST BE AWARE THAT IT WON'T HAPPEN.


    IF YOU HAVE RACF, DON'T FORGET TO ADD BOTH STARTED TASK NAMES
    TO ICHRIN03. IF YOU HAVE ACF2, OR SOME OTHER SYSTEM, YOU'RE ON
    YOUR OWN. JUST BE AWARE OF THE TYPES OF DATASETS YOU MAY NEED
    TO ACCESS/ALLOCATE/DELETE/UPDATE DURING AN EMERGENCY.



  PF KEY ASSIGNMENTS

     PFK DEFINITIONS CANNOT BE CHANGED:

              PF1  - HELP
              PF2  - SPLIT THE SCREEN
              PF3  - RETURN (IN EDIT, SAVE AND END)
              PF4  - CANCEL (IN EDIT, END NOSAVE)
              PF5  - FIND OR REPEAT FIND IN EDIT OR BROWSE
              PF6  - CHANGE OR REPEAT CHANGE IN EDIT
              PF7  - SCROLL UP
              PF8  - SCROLL DOWN
              PF9  - SWITCH SCREENS (FOR SPLIT-SCREEN MODE)
              PF10 - SCROLL LEFT  (BROWSE ONLY)
              PF11 - SCROLL RIGHT (BROWSE ONLY)
              PF12 - CURSOR HOME


     A SPECIAL NOTE ON PF9: WHEN IN SPLIT-SCREEN MODE, YOU MUST USE
     PF9 TO SWITCH FROM ONE SCREEN TO ANOTHER. JUST MOVING THE
     CURSOR DOESN'T GET IT.


  OPERATIONAL NOTE

     ETPS IS IMPLEMENTED AS A STARTED TASK, AND IS DEFINED AS A
     SUB-SYSTEM IN "SYS1.PARMLIB(IEFSSN01)". IT WILL START WITHOUT
     JES BEING ACTIVE. THE JCL IS JUST AN EXEC CARD, SO THE CHANCES
     OF A JCL ERROR ARE MINIMAL. ALSO, IF PUT IN "SYS1.PROCLIB",
     IT SHOULD ALWAYS BE START-ABLE, UNLESS THAT LIBRARY IS DAMAGED.

     IT IS STARTED FROM THE CONSOLE BY ENTERING:

     S ETPS,TRM1=ETPS34AB    (THIS IS THE DEFAULT TERMINAL)
                     3       INDICATES A 3279-3B
                      4AB    CHANNEL AND UNIT ADDRESS

                       CHANGES TO BE DONE
 ********************************************************************

    SCROLL   WHEN SCROLLING A PDS DIRECTORY MEMBER LIST, THE BOTTOM
             LINE OF THE DISPLAY IS SOMETIMES NOT USED. THIS ALSO
             HAPPENS WHEN IN SPLIT-SCREEN MODE.

    SCROLL   WHEN SCROLLING A PDS DIRECTORY MEMBER LIST DOWN AND UP,
             POSITIONING IS SOMEWHAT ERRATIC; THE SCROLL AMOUNT IS
             USUALLY LESS THAN A PAGE.

    CURSOR   CURSOR POSITIONING LOGIC MAY BE OFF IN SPLIT-SCREEN.

    LIB MGMT MAY NEED PANVALET SUPPORT.

    ESTAE    NEEDS TO BE ADDED.

    EDIT     NEEDS THE FOLLOWING:
             1. COPY RANGE ("CC").
             2. REPEAT RANGE ("RR").
             3. DELETE RANGE ("DD").
             4. COPY DATASET OR MEMBER.
             5. CREATE MEMBER.
             6. PANVALET SUPPORT.
             7. CHANGE ALL.
             8. CHANGE UNEQUAL LENGTH STRING.

   UTILITY   COMPLETE, AS IS.

   IDCAMS    COMPLETE, AS IS.

   DATASET   NEED TO ADD, WITH ALLOCATE, DISPLAY, CATALOG, ETC.

   JES       NEED TO ADD SOME SORT OF JES INTERFACE.

                CHANGES FOR VERSION  2.4

  *********************************************************************



   11/10/86  VERSION 2.4. ENHANCEMENTS TO THE   BRIAN COOK      MNP
             IDCAMS INTERFACE:

             1. INCREASED NUMBER OF INPUT COMMAND DATA
                LINES FROM 1 TO 5 TO ALLOW FOR MORE
                VERBOSE COMMANDS, SUCH AS "DEFINE PAGESPACE".
             2. ALLOW SCROLLING UP AND DOWN IN THE
                OUTPUT USING PF7/PF8.

             ALSO ADDED SOME HELP SCREENS.

   11/06/86  OPEN PROBLEM NOTED.                BRIAN COOK      MNP
             ON THE EDIT AND BROWSE SCREENS, WHEN IN SPLIT-SCREEN
             MODE ON THE BOTTOM SCREEN, THE CURSOR IS PLACED 1
             CHARACTER TO THE LEFT OF THE "DSNAME" INPUT FIELD.
             THE PDS, IDCAMS, AND PRIMARY OPTION MENU WORK OK!!!!!

   11/03/86  LIB  ROUTINE IGNORING VOLSER,      BRIAN COOK      MNP
             RESULTING IN EDIT-SAVE INTO A CATALOGED
             PDS INSTEAD OF AN UNCATALOGED ONE SELECTED
             BY SPECIFIC VOLSER. MINOR OVERSIGHT,
             THANKS, OKLAHOMA STATE.

     7/7/86  ADDED BACK I/O ATTENTION EXIT,     W.A.M.         VCCS
             FOR TUBE I/O.


             PERSONALLY, I CAN'T GET THIS TO WORK AT ALL,  BC  MNP
             SO I HAVE SET UP "EXCPFLG1" AND "EXCPFLG2"
             THAT CAN BE SET TO NON-ZERO IF ANYONE
             WANTS TO TRY TO DEBUG THIS. THE ERROR I GET
             IS AN S0C4 IN IECVPST. IT APPEARS THAT THE
             ATTENTION EXIT GETS CONTROL IN AMODE 24, BUT
             THE RETURN ADDRESS IS A 31-BIT ADDRESS.



    6/25/86  VERSION 2.3. ENHANCEMENTS TO THE   BRIAN COOK      MNP
             PDS INTERFACE:

             1. COMPRESS OPTION
             2. MEMBER SELECTION "HELP" PANEL
             3. MEMBER SELECTION OPTIONS FOR
                BROWSE, EDIT, RENAME, DELETE,
                AND COPY

             ALSO FIXED BUGS IN THE SBA CALC,
             AND REMOVED THE MENU HIERARCHY LOGIC.

    1/21/86  3279-2C WORKS SAME AS 3278-2A      WAYNE MITCHELL  VCCS
1


   12/17/85  REMOVED ALMOST ALL OF THE EXCP     BRIAN COOK      MNP
             LOGIC FOR TERMINAL I/O, DUE TO
             ABEND'S AFTER INSTALLING 1.3.3.

             WITHOUT THE ATTENTION EXIT, ETPS JUST
             LOOPS AROUND A 2-SECOND "STIMER", SO
             THE TERMINAL RESPONSE TIME IS VERY
             SLUGGISH.


    4/24/85  ADDED OPTION 4.1, FOREGROUND       BRIAN COOK      MNP
             INVOKATION OF IDCAMS. MODULE IS
             "ETPSIDC2".

    4/09/85  INCORPORATED CHANGES FOR 3278-2A   BRIAN COOK      MNP
             SUPPORT, REDUCED LOGON SCREEN TO
             20 LINES, ALLOW "CAN" AS ABBREVIATION
             FOR EDIT "CANCEL".

             CHANGES PROVIDED BY WAYNE MITCHELL,      W.A.M.   VCCS
             VIRGINIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM.

    4/04/85  REVISED DSECTS, MADE INTO MACRO    BRIAN COOK      MNP
             CALLS. ALSO SPLIT OUT EDITOR
             MODULE, ETPSEDT3, AND BROWSE,
             ETPSBRO3.

    9/27/84  VERSION 2.1 -- ADDED TSO MODE      BRIAN COOK      MNP
             AND DSECT FOR NATIVE VTAM. SEE
             PROGRAM "ETPSTSO" FOR DOC ON
             RUNNING UNDER TSO. VTAM CONTROL
             PROGRAM WILL BE DEVELOPED ONE OF
             THESE DAYS.

    6/20/84  ADDED BROWSE PROCESSING, VERSION   BRIAN COOK      MNP
             1.1 FLAG ON LOGON/PRIMARY MENUS. THE
             BROWSE MODULE IS BASED ON "REVIEW",
             BY BILL GODFREY. IT HAS BEEN MUCH
             MODIFIED TO RUN UNDER ETPS, AND
             HAS ALSO BEEN ENHANCED TO SUPPORT
             BROWSING DSID'S DIRECTLY ON THE
             JES2 SPOOL. (USES MODIFIED UAL SVC.)

             (THE JES2 BROWSE IS FOR A POSSIBLE
             FUTURE ENHANCEMENT.)

    6/11/84  ADDED RETURN CODE TEST AFTER       BRIAN COOK      MNP
             GETMAIN FOR ATTENTION EXIT.

    5/16/84  ADDED SPF STATS SUPPORT.           BRIAN COOK      MNP

    4/19/83  ADDED BYPASS OF LOGON PANEL FOR EMERGENCY USE. IF ETPS
             IS INVOKED WITH A PARM BEGINNING WITH THE LETTERS "OP",
             A LOGON IS NOT REQUIRED.           BRIAN COOK       MNP
1


    6/10/83  CHANGED TUBE IO TO EXCP.           BRIAN COOK      MNP

    6/11/83  ADDED UPDATE-IN-PLACE LOGIC FOR    BRIAN COOK      MNP
             PDS MEMBERS THAT ARE EDITED AND
             SAVED. IF THE NUMBER OF CARDS IS
             THE SAME BEFORE AND AFTER THE
             EDIT, AN UPDATE-IN-PLACE IS DONE.
