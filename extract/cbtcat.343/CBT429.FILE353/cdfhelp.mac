%------------------- CONSOLE DISPLAY FACILITY  (CDF)  ------------------
+
+  CDF is an in-house written system that provides a console display.
+
+  You can enter console commands just as though you were the master
+  console operator, so BE CAREFUL!
+
+  CDF commands are:
+
+      SAVEn -- saves the last previous command in a table as entry numb
+      LASTn -- restores the command in table entry number "n" to the cm
+
+  Current command table entries are:
+
+      LAST1 -- _LASTCMD1
+      LAST2 -- _LASTCMD2
+      LAST3 -- _LASTCMD3
+      LAST4 -- _LASTCMD4
+      LAST5 -- _LASTCMD5
+      LAST6 -- _LASTCMD6
+      LAST7 -- _LASTCMD7
+      LAST8 -- _LASTCMD8
+      LAST9 -- _LASTCMD9
