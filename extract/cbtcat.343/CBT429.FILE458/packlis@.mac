 A set of two programs which performs the following functions :
 --------------------------------------------------------------

 1. PSWSAMP  : is the sample taker program for PACKLIST. The technique
               is to move the usefull trace table entries to an output
               record. At start time, the sample rate is approximately
               once every 2.5 seconds, then the program tries to adjust
               it dynamically.
               The program will run for a default time interval set of
               15 minutes and then will automatically terminate. It may
               be interrupted using the STOP (P) command.

               The program (started task) is invoked as below :

                    S SAMPLER,...eventual parameters change...

               where SAMPLER (in the data-set EUR1.STC.PROCLIB) is the
               following procedure :

                    //SAMPLER PROC M=,V=USER01,P=10,S=10,US=SYS1,NX=0
                    //SAMPLER EXEC PGM=PSWSAMP,PARM=&M
                    //SYSDIR0   DD DSN=SYS1.LPALIB,DISP=SHR
                    //SYSDIR1   DD DSN=.....LPALIB,DISP=SHR        (1)
                    //SYSPSW    DD UNIT=SYSDA,VOLUME=SER=&V,       (2)
                    //             DSN=&US..SAMPLER.DATA&NX,
                    //             SPACE=(CYL,(&P,&S)),DISP=(NEW,CATLG)
                    //SYSPRINT  DD UNIT=SYSDA,VOLUME=SER=&V,
                    //             DSN=&US..SAMPLER.LLPA&NX,
                    //             SPACE=(CYL,(1,1)),DISP=(NEW,CATLG),
                    //             DCB=(RECFM=FBA,BLKSIZE=1210,
                                                  LRECL=121)
                    //SYSIN     DD DSN=EUR1.STC.PROCLIB(SAMPLIN),
                    //             DISP=SHR
                    //SYSDOU    DD UNIT=SYSDA,VOLUME=SER=&V,
                    //             DSN=&US..SAMPLER.DLPA&NX,
                    //             SPACE=(CYL,(1,1)),DISP=(NEW,CATLG),
                    //             DCB=(RECFM=FBA,BLKSIZE=1210,
                                                  LRECL=121)
                    //SYSDIN    DD DSN=EUR1.STC.PROCLIB(SAMPDIN),
                    //             DISP=SHR
                    //SYSUDUMP  DD SYSOUT=A

                                                      PACKLIST  2/3.

               the SAMPLIN member contains only the LISTLPA statement
               as needed by AMBLIST (service aids program), and the
               SAMPDIN member contains the following statements
                 LISTPDS DSNAME=SYS1.LPALIB,DUMP
                 LISTPDS DSNAME=.....LPALIB,VOL=DISK=......,DUMP   (1)
               as needed by IEHLIST (utility program).

               The parameter M=... may be used to set the desired time
               interval limit, expressed in minutes (max. 1200).
               At any moment during the run, through the MODIFY (F)
               command, this time interval limit may be changed.
               If PARM=NULL is specified, then only LISTLPA (AMBLIST)
               and LISTPDS (IEHLIST) are executed.

       Notes : (1) concatenated LPA libraries if any.
               (2) omit if PARM=NULL is specified.

    MANDATORY : to collect usefull information, the PSWSAMP program
                needs the System Trace be active, so you must use
                TRACE ST and TRACE ST,OFF start/stop system commands
                (the defaults AS=ON BR=OFF EX=ON are the only options
                needed). However, at the start time, when the trace
                is found inactive, the program tries to start it for
                his purposes. If successfully started, then it stops
                the trace automatically at the end.

 2. PACKLIST : is the program to build a new IEAPAK00 member for the
               SYS1.PARMLIB. The data are obtained from the use of the
               PSWSAMP taker. The construction is based on frequency
               of interrupts in a given LPA module. Association by
               frequency is possible, but is not enforced.
               The interrupts in and to LPA are counted. Then the
               counts for each module are divided by the length of
               that module. This index value is sorted into descending
               order. The Pack-list is then built, taking page
               boundaries into account. When this is finished, the
               individual records are reversed in order to place the
               most active closest to the LPA page directory on the
               LPA paging data-set. All members of LPALIB should be
               included in the Pack-list at the front of IEAPAK00.
               If a member is not included in the Pack-list, it goes
               to the spot desired for the most active LPA members.

               The program (batch task) may be invoked as below :

                    //PACKLST EXEC PGM=PACKLIST
                    //SYSLPA    DD ... data-set containig output of
                                       LISTLPA / AMBLIST of PSWSAMP
                    //SYSDIR    DD ... data-set containig output of
                                       LISTPDS / IEHLIST of PSWSAMP
                    //SYSPSW    DD ... data-set containing samples
                                       gathered by PSWSAMP
               or : //SYSPSW    DD DUMMY if PSWSAMP has run with
                                       PARM=NULL
                    //SYSPUNCH  DD ... output data-set for IEAPAK00
                    //SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=A     report on activity
                    //SYSLIST   DD SYSOUT=A     optional (see PARM)

               The following options are selectable through the PARM
               field of the EXEC statement :
                    D - Abend with dump on error detection (need
                        SYSUDUMP DD-card).
                    L - List LISTLPA/LISTPDS output (need SYSLIST
                        DD-card).
                    P - List in place of punch IEAPAK00 (need SYSLIST
                        DD-card).
                    S - Snap internal table request (Debug aid, need
                        SYSSNAP DD-card).
                    T - Use 62 characters line print length for TSO
                        viewing (SYSPRINT output file).
               The single characters options may be specified in any
               order, and must not be separated each from the other.
