  ------------

  Purpose :   The MEMSTAT command is intended for use in CLISTs.
  ---------   It allows conditional execution based on whether a
              member exists in a given partitioned data-set (library).
       Note - MEMSTAT returns a condition code of 0 if the member
              exists in the library and, if not, a code of 4 is
              returned. Other condition codes are :
                8 = a severe error occurred (message is given).
              The CLIST variable &LASTCC will contain the return code.

  Syntax :    MEMSTAT  dsname(memname)  LIST
  --------                              NOLIST
              Example :  MEMSTAT  LIB.DATA(MEMBER)

  OPERANDS :  Required - dsname(memname)
  ----------  Default  - None
  DSNAME :    The name of the library you wish to check.
  MEMNAME :   The name of the member you wish to check for in the
              library.
  LIST :      A message will be given with the member's status.
              This is the default if neither LIST nor NOLIST is
              entered.
  NOLIST :    No message will be given.
