)F FUNCTION :  DSNCHECK is a command which checks the system catalogs
               for the existence of a data-set name or alias.
               If a library (PDS) member name is specified with the
               data-set name, DSNCHECK will check for the existence
               of the named member.
)X SYNTAX :    DSNCHECK  dsname  LIST
               DSNC              NOLIST
               Command alias : DSNC
               Return codes:  0 - successfull in locating catalog
                                  entry (and, optionally, member name).
                              4 - member not found.
                              8 - catalog error.
                             12 - not partitioned data-set (only if
                                  member name).
                             16 - parse error.
                             20 - allocation error.
                             24 - open error.
                             28 - close error.
                             32 - deallocation error.

)O OPERANDS :  Required - none, you will be prompted for dsname
               Default  - LIST
))dsname : the data-set name you are checking the catalog for. If the
               name is enclosed in single quotes ('), it will be used
               as is. If it is not enclosed in single quotes, your TSO
               prefix will be added to the beginning of the name.
               If you want to check a library (PDS) for a particular
               member name, include the member name within parentheses
               at the end of the library name.
               Examples :
               library (data-set) name : 'ABC.YOURLIB.TEXT'
               library and member name : 'ABC.YOURLIB.TEXT(LETTER)'
))LIST : causes DSNCHECK to write a message on the terminal saying
               whether or not the data-set was cataloged.
               NOTE - LIST is the default.
))NOLIST : suppresses writing a message to the terminal concerning
               whether or not the data-set was cataloged. This is
               usefull in CLISTs.
