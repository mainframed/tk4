)F Function :
  The HEL command displays a HELP member on a 3270 terminal
  in full screen mode (80 character wide screens only).
  In the field labelled MEMBER==> _______, HEL displays the current
  HELP member; if the cursor is positioned to this field and a command
  name is entered, HEL will display that new member's HELP data.
  In the field labelled SUBCOMMAND==> _______, HEL displays the current
  subcommand of the HELP command; if the cursor is positioned to this
  field and a name is entered, HEL will display the member's HELP data
  for the entered subcommand.
  The field labelled INPUT==> _______ is the primary input field for
  HEL; any supported subcommand may be entered.
  In the field labelled RANGE NN, HEL displays the default forward and
  backward space quantity, if the cursor is positioned to this field
  and a number is entered, that quantity will become the default
  forward and backward space quantity.
