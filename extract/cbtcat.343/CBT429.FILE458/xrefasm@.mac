  THE XREFASM PROGRAMS
  --------------------
         Many large programming systems are constructed from a large
    of separately assembled or compiled sections. Such systems must
    manage internal communications by means of a set of vector tables
    and other control blocks that are known to each of the separate
    sections; which is to say, such control blocks must contain fields
    that may be referenced and/or changed by any or all of the
    sections. Accordingly, a global cross-reference listing reporting
    which sections reference which fields, is a very useful tool for
    a large-systems developer to have.

         XREFASM is a relatively simple system that generates such
    global cross reference listings. Specifically, XREFASM generates a
    report showing sorted list of all labels used in a given set of
    separate assemblies or compilations. The entries for each label
    show both which assemblies (or compilations) reference that label
    and how many references each assembly has to that label.
    Figure 1 shows a sample XREFASM output.

    Figure 1  Sample XREFASM Output

         Currently, XREFASM will produce global cross-reference listings
    for programs assembled or compiled by the following processors :
         - IBM's OS/VS DOS/VSE VM/370 Assembler
         - IBM's Assembler-H Version 2, with or without the "S.L.A.C."
           mods.
         - IBM's Series/1 Host Program Preparation Facility Assembler

         Recognition by XREFASM of which kind of output is being
    processed is automatic.
         XREFASM actually consists of two programs. XREFIN accumulates
    cross-reference data from each assembly or compilation. XREFOUT
    sorts and edit the accumulated data and produces the global cross-
    reference report.

                                                      XREFASM   3/9.

  XREFIN
  ------
         XREFIN accumulates cross-reference data from individual
    assemblies or compilations. It is designed to be used as follows :
         One-step assembly jobs should be changed to two-step jobs
           consisting of the assembly step followed by the XREFIN step.
         The assembly step should write its listing file to a temporary
           dataset rather than to spool.
         The XREFIN step can then read the listing file and extract
           from it the relevant cross-reference information. In
           addition, the XREFIN program can echo the listing dataset
           to a SYSPRINT file, if desired.

         XREFIN extracts cross-reference data and writes it "mod" to an
    accumulation dataset which will later be processed by XREFOUT. Each
    record written is assigned both the name of the current assembly
    and a timestamp associated with the current run. XREFIN infers the
    assembly name by examining the page title lines appearing in the
    assembly listing. The first word appearing in the title line is
    taken to be the assembly name. For both the S/370 Assembler,
    Assembler H, and the Series/1 Assembler, this first word is set
    from the name field of the "TITLE" assembler statement.

         The timestamp is stored so that later XREFOUT can control the
    results of repeated assemblies of the same sections. If the same
    is assembled twice and XREFIN is, therefore, executed twice for the
    same section, the two complete sets of cross-reference data will be
    written to the accumulation file. Because of the timestamps,
    XREFOUT can recognize the situation and discard the older
    cross-reference data.

  XREFIN has the following JCL requirements.
  ------------------------------------------

    EXEC Card Keyword : REGION=100K
         XREFIN's memory requirements are trivial. REGION=100K should
         be more than enough.

    DDNAME : LISTING
             Attributes :
             access method           QSAM
             DSORG                   PS
             RECFM                   any

             defaults                (PS,UA,255,255)
         This file is required. It must contain the listing output
    produced by preceeding assembly. XREFIN echos the file to SYSPRINT
    (if available) and scans it for cross-reference data on the way.
    All such data is saved in a accumulation file for later processing
    by XREFOUT.

    DDNAME : XREF
             Attributes :
             access method           QSAM
             DSORG                   PS

             defaults                (PS,FB,158,3950)
         This is the accumulation file. The cross-reference data is
    extracted from the listing file and written to this file. It should
    be allocated with DISP=MOD so as not to overwrite previously
    accumulated data. It is a required file. If it is omitted, then
    XREFIN will abend (probably with a 0C1).

    DDNAME : SYSPRINT
             Attributes :
             access method           QSAM
             DSORG                   PS

             BLKSIZE                 any
             defaults                the attributes of the LISTING file
         This file is optional. If present, then it receives an echo
    of the LISTING file. If omitted, then no echo is produced.

    DDNAME : SYSTERM

             BLKSIZE                 255
         This file is optional. If present, then XREFIN's information
    messages are written to it. If it is omitted, then the messages are
    discarded (XREFIN does not issue any error messages).

  XREFIN Completion Codes.
  ------------------------
       0 : XREFIN has completed processing without error.
      16 : The LISTING file has not been given. XREFIN cannot proceed.

                                                      XREFASM   5/9.

  XREFOUT
  -------
         XREFOUT sorts and edits accumulated cross-reference data and
    produces global cross-reference report (see figure 1). If the
    accumulation dataset contains either obsolete entries (due to
    re-assemblies) or "purged " entries (see below), then XREFOUT will
    discard them so that they will not affect the cross-reference
    report. Further, XREFOUT may, at the user's option rewrite the
    sorted and compressed accumulation file back either to the original
    dataset or to a new one. This helps to control the size of the file.
         XREFOUT performs the data sort  by dynamically invoking IBM's
    Sort/Merge program. Any compatible substitute could be used instead
    (e.g., SYNCSORT) XREFOUT links to Sort/Merge via the name "SORT".

  XREFOUT has the following JCL requirements.
  -------------------------------------------

    EXEC Card Keyword : REGION=
         XREFOUT's memory requirements are affected by the size of the
         sort that needs to be done. Accordingly, the appropriate
         Sort/Merge manual should be consulted and its recomendations
         followed. Generally, REGION=1024K should be a good value.

    EXEC Card Keyword : PARM=
         Any string given in the PARM field is displayed in XREFOUT's
         title line as the object of the preposition "for" (see
         figure 1). If no PARM field is given, then the word "for" is
         dropped from the title. May be preceeded by keyword "ONLY/"
         to obtain a short instead of a fully cross-reference list.

    DDNAME : XREF
             Attributes :
             access method           QSAM
             DSORG                   PS
             RECFM                   FB
             LRECL                   158
             BLKSIZE                 158*n
         This file is required. It contains the accumulated cross-
    reference data that is to be processed. In addition it may contain
    "purge control data" as described below.

    DDNAME : REWRITE
             Attributes :
             access method           QSAM
             DSORG                   PS
             RECFM                   FB
             LRECL                   158
             BLKSIZE                 158*n
             defaults                same attributes as the XREF file
         This file is optional. If present, then a copy of the XREF
    file (with obsolete or purged entries edited out) is written to it.
    This ddname may point to the identically same dataset as the XREF
    ddname, since it is not opened until after the XREF file is closed.
    If a REWRITE ddname is not given, then compressed cross-reference
    data is not rewritten.

                                                      XREFASM   6/9.

    DDNAME : SYSPRINT

             BLKSIZE                 133*n
             defaults                (PS,FBA,133,3990)
         This file is optional. If present, then the generated master
    cross-reference listing is written to it. If it is not available,
    then the cross-reference listing is discarded.

             Attributes :            Sort/Merge dependant
             usage                   Sort/Merge message dataset
         This file is required. It is used by Sort/Merge as its message
    file (in place of SYSOUT). Its attributes are dependant upon the
    particular Sort/Merge being used.

    DDNAME : SORTLIB
             Attributes :
             access method           program fetch
             DSORG                   PO

             usage                   load library
         This file may or may not be required depending upon the
    Sort/Merge program being used. When required, this ddname should
    point to the SYS1.SORTLIB dataset.

    DDNAMEs : SORTWK0n
             Attributes :
             usage                   Sort/Merge work space
             size                    large
         One or more SORTWK0n files (n 1) may be required by Sort/Merge.
    The work areas should be large enough to accomodate the number of
    records being sorted. Refer to the appropriate Sort/Merge manual
    for details.

  XREFOUT Completion Codes.
  -------------------------
       0 : XREFOUT has completed processing without error.
       4 : The number of assemblies being cross-referenced has
           exceeded 1000.
      16 : The XREF ddname has not been provided.
           XREFOUT cannot proceed.
1   16/06/87
                                                      XREFASM   7/9.

  Purging References to Obselete Assemblies.
  ------------------------------------------

         Sometimes it is desirable to purge from the accumulated cross-
    reference references to assemblies that, for one reason or another,
    have become obselete and have been dropped. This might also be
    necessary if the name on the TITLE card for an assembly has been
    changed thus making what really is the same assembly module appear
    to XREFOUT to be two different assembly modules. To accomplish this
    purging, the user should place into the accumulation file one or
    more "purge control records". These are records that start with a
    blank character (at offset +0) followed by an assembly module name
    (at offset +1 for up to 8 characters). The remaining 149 bytes of
    the purge control record are ignored.
         When XREFOUT encounters a purge control record, it will then
    delete from the accumulated data all records containing an assembly
    module name that matches the one given by the purge record. Note
    that an assembly module name that is entirely blank is valid. This
    corresponds to the case where an assembly does not contain a TITLE
    card or contains only ones having blank name fields.
         Purge control records must be put into an accumulation file
    manually. They may be placed anywhere in the file since XREFOUT
    always sorts the file in a way that moves them to the top. Any
    number of purge records may be put into the file, and redundant
    records do not hurt.
         There are any number of methods of placing purge records into
    an accumulation file. They can be edited in assuming that the file
    is not too big for the editor being used. They can be written in
    with IEBGENER. Just be sure to use DISP=MOD. Or they can be placed
    into a separate file which would then be concatenated via JCL to
    the accumulation file when XREFOUT is executed. Be aware, though,
    that XREFOUT does not support "unlike concatenation", thus the file
    containing the purge records must have the same attributes as the
    accumulation file.
