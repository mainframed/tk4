  Purpose :    This program manipulates the data of a printed page
  ---------    so that it can be printed on a 3800 printer using a
               character set that contains characters rotated 90
               degrees clockwise.

  CBT origin : Extracted from CBT tape JUN 84, file 316.

  Operational considerations :
  ----------------------------

         The input data may be fixed or variable, from PS or PO
  data-sets, and may include the carriage control character (except
  that the space suppress cc (+) is not supported, it is just handle
  as a blank, single line space cc).
         When the carriage control character is omitted, a new page is
  provided following the FCB definition value.
         Also the printed line length will be equal to the input file
  record length, unless it is larger than the FCB definition value
  (control carriage not included). In this case the line will be
  truncated (the remaining text is lost).
         The FCB and CHARS characters sets are normally defined and
  stored in the SYS1.IMAGELIB using the IEBIMAGE program (IBM utility),
  then, these may be selected through the PARM field (EXEC statement),
  in accord with the ROTATER internal tables conventions (PARM=XYZ).

  JCL example :
  -------------

         //...  JOB  ...
         /*JOBPARM K=0,... <--- LINECT=0 or K=0 is mandatory
         //LIST   EXEC  PGM=ROTATER
         //SYSUT1   DD  DSN=...input data-set...,DISP=OLD OR SHR
         //SYSUT2   DD  SYSOUT=A,CHARS=T11,COPIES=1

         Notes - CHARS=T11 is just a reference to force the JFCB
                 Extension block to be generated.
               - When PARM is omitted, a default is used.
