  Description :
  -------------
           This program compares the directories of two partitioned
           data-sets and prints a report showing which members
           match and which members do not match or are not present
           in both directories.
           Members are said to match if their names are the same,
           and (if PARM=USER) if all the other data in their
           directory entries are equal (except fields containing
           TTR track addresses).
           Data records for the members are not compared.
           Only the information in the directory is compared.

  DDNAMEs :        SYSPRINT - Report output
  ---------        SYSLIB1  - PDS 1 input
                   SYSLIB2  - PDS 2 input

  Options : - If PARM=USER : members that are present in both libraries
  ---------        will be compared for matching USER-DATA.
                   USER-DATA consists of up to 64 bytes of data
                   in the directory entry which is put there by
                   the linkage editor, SPF edit, and others.
                   Note : with PARM=USER, if two members have the same
                          name and neither has any USER-DATA, they are
                          treated as unequal, with a unique message
                          for this case.
            - If PARM=EQO : only members that match will be listed.
            - If PARM=NEO (or PARM=SHORT) : only members that don't
                   match will be listed.
            - If neither of the above, all members will be listed for
                   both libraries.
            - If PARM='SIZE=...' : set the 2 PDS directories core
                   storage space size to ...K size (default is 128K).
                   Usefull to avoid an abend S800 if big directories.

            Note : when more PARM keywords must be specified in the
                   PARM field, they must be separated by one blank.
                   i.e. : PARM='SHORT SIZE=256'
