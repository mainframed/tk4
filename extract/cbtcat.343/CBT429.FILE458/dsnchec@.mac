  Function :          DSNCHECK is a command which checks the system
                      catalogs for the existence of a data-set name
                      or alias. If a library (PDS) member name is
                      specified with the data-set name, DSNCHECK will
                      check for the existence of the named member.

  Command    Operands

  DSNCHECK   dsname  LIST
  DSNC               NOLIST
  --------------------------------------------------------------------
  Command alias : DSNC

  Operands :
     Required - none, you will be prompted for dsname
     Default  - LIST

     dsname = The data-set name you are checking the catalog for.
                           If the name is enclosed in single quotes
                           ('), it will be used as is. If it is not
                           enclosed in single quotes, your TSO prefix
                           will be added to the beginning of the name.
                           If you want to check a library (PDS) for a
                           particular member name, include the member
                           name within parentheses at the end of the
                           library name.
              Examples :
                 library (data-set) name : 'ABC.YOURLIB.TEXT'
                 library and member name : 'ABC.YOURLIB.TEXT(LETTER)'

                                                      DSNCHECK  2/2.

     LIST = Causes DSNCHECK to write a message on the terminal saying
                           whether or not the data-set was cataloged.
                           NOTE - LIST is the default.

     NOLIST = Suppresses writing a message to the terminal concerning
                           whether or not the data-set was cataloged.
                           This is usefull in CLISTs.

  Return codes :  0 - successfull in locating catalog entry, (and,
                      optionally, member name).
                  4 - member not found.
                  8 - catalog error.
                 12 - not partitioned data-set (only if member name).
                 16 - parse error.
                 20 - allocation error.
                 24 - open error.
                 28 - close error.
                 32 - deallocation error.
                 36 - run error.

  Examples of use :
  -----------------
              1. Find out whether 'MASSTAX' is a member of your own
                 data-set called LIB.LOAD :

                       DSNCHECK  LIB.LOAD(MASSTAX)

              2. Find out whether a catalog entry exists for a
                 data-set named : 'ABC1234.STARTUP.CLIST'

                       DSNCHECK  'ABC1234.STARTUP.CLIST'

              3. Write a CLIST to execute a program named 'ACCTREPT'
                 if it exists in either library 'ABC.PROD.LOAD' or
                 'XYZ.TEST.LOAD' :

                 PROC  0
                       DSNCHECK 'ABC.PROD.LOAD(ACCTREPT)' NOLIST
                       IF &LASTCC EQ 0 THEN +
                         CALL 'ABC.PROD.LOAD(ACCTREPT)'
                       ELSE DO
                         DSNCHECK 'XYZ.TEST.LOAD(ACCTREPT)' NOLIST
                         IF &LASTCC EQ 0 THEN +
                           CALL 'XYZ.TEST.LOAD(ACCTREPT)'
                         END
                       EXIT CODE(&MAXCC)
