  ------------

  Function :  the COMPARE command compares two sequential data-sets
  ----------  or members. The compare is done by either the YALE
              COMPARE program (COMPAREB) or by the IBM COMPARE utility
              program (IEBCOMPR). The 'SYSPRINT' messages are written
              to wherever FILENAME(SYSPRINT) is allocated - usually
              to the terminal.

  Syntax :    COMPARE 'OLD-DSNAME' 'NEW-DSNAME'
  --------    Optional keywords are :
                 FULL     - include the sequence numbers (YALE pgm).
                 ASM      - comparing assembler source code (YALE pgm).
                 IEBCOMPR - the IEBCOMPR utility of IBM is to be used.
                 OVOL(VOLUME) - volume containing the OLD data-set.
                            Not needed if cataloged.
                 NVOL(VOLUME) - volume containing the NEW data-set.
                            Not needed if cataloged.
                 OUNIT(UNIT) - unit name for allocating the OLD
                            data-set. Not needed if cataloged.
                 NUNIT(UNIT) - unit name for allocating the NEW
                            data-set. Not needed if cataloged.
                 SYSOUT   - messages to a SYSOUT data-set.
                 PRINT    - messages to terminal (default).
                 NOPRINT  - messages to dummy file.
                 OUTFILE(FILENAME) - messages to specified DDname.
              When the OVOL or NVOL keywords are used to indicate
              two identically named data-sets on different volumes
              are being used, unexpected results can occur unless
              both OVOL and NVOL are specified. For example, if
              OVOL is specified and NVOL is not, the allocation
              of 'NEWDSNAME' with no volume specified may pick up
              the already allocated 'OLDDSNAME' instead of the
              'NEWDSNAME' in the catalog.
         Required - 'OLD DSNAME' and 'NEW DSNAME'
         Defaults - the YALE COMPARE program (COMPAREB) is used.
         Alias    - none.

  Operands :  'DSNAME1' - the name of the SYSUT1 or OLD data-set.
  ----------      A member name must be specified if it is partitioned.
              'DSNAME2' - the name of the SYSUT2 or NEW data-set.
                  A member name must be specified if it is partitioned.
