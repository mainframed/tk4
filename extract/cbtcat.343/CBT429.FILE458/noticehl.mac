)O OPERANDS -
))CLEAR(nn) : The maximum number of messages to clear in the TSO
              BROADCAST data-set. Restricted to OPERATOR privilege.
              ALIAS : CL(nn)
              DEFAULT : CLEAR(30)
              NOTE : messages are entered by SE '...',SAVE command.
))NOCLEAR :   Messages will not be cleared in the TSO BROADCAST
              data-set. Restricted to OPERATOR privilege.
              ALIAS : NOCL
              NOTE : messages are entered by SE '...',LOGON command.
))LIST or TEST : Messages are just scanned from the input data-set.
              ALIAS : none
))BROADCAST(dsn) : Messages from 'dsn' input data-set will be scanned,
              and added to the TSO BROADCAST data-set if user allowed.
              ALIAS : BC(dsn)
              DEFAULT : BROADCAST('->.OPER.NOTICES.DATA')
))NOBROADCAST : No messages to be added to the TSO BROADCAST data-set.
              ALIAS : NOBC
))EXAMPLES -
  A. Normal user :
    1. - Test or list a prepared notice board, from a private
         library member 'USERID.MYLIB.DATA(MEMO1)' :
            NOTICE BC(MYLIB.DATA(MEMO1))
    2. - List the system notices data-set :
            NOTICE BC
  B. OPERATOR privilege :
    1. - Add an item temporarily to the bottom of the notices board
         from a private library member 'USERID.MYLIB.DATA(MEMO1)' :
            NOTICE NOCL BC(MYLIB.DATA(MEMO1))
    2. - Clear up to 15 lines in the TSO BROADCAST data-set :
            NOTICE CL(15)
    3. - Clear up to 30 lines in the TSO BROADCAST data-set, and
         recreate the notices from the system notices data-set :
            NOTICE CL BC
))INPUT data-set cards description :
         The messages are created from 80-byte card images.
         The card type is designated by characters in the beginning
         of the card image (col.1). Types can be in lower/UPPER case.
         *        = Comment.
         -com     = Comment.
         -dates   = DD/MM/YY dates for message to begin and end, or
                   set the word 'current' to indicate the message(s)
                   permanent status.
                   (Default is the previous -dates card.)
         blank    = Message text (65-bytes, beginning with col. 2).
         -end     = End of message text (causes line of hyphens).
)S SUBCOMMANDS : The NOTICE command has no subcommands.
)M MESSAGES -
))BUL0001I ...text...
         This is the first 71 characters of text processed by the
         NOTICE command. Apostrophes will be expanded to double
         apostrophes.
))BUL0002I CLEAR operation complete.
         A number of messages have been cleared from the TSO BROADCAST
         data-set through use of the CLEAR operand of the command.
))BUL0003E OPERATOR authority is required for CLEAR or BROADCAST.
         The CLEAR or BROADCAST operation was not performed because
         you did not have OPERATOR authority.
))BUL0004E Input file must have 80-byte, fixed length records.
         The BROADCAST operation was not performed because the input
         data-set was in a format which NOTICE could not process.
         Copy the text to a data-set with fixed 80-bytes length
         records and try again.
))BUL0005C Unable to process date : xxxxxxxx. Current date assumed.
         A date field on a '-DATES' input card image was not in the
         format of DD/MM/YY. NOTICE assumed the current date for
         both the start and stop dates. Check for two-digit DD, MM,
         and YY. Check for DD less than 32, and MM less than 13.
         Also check for a slash (/) in the third and sixth positions
         (E.g., '-dates 04/07/86 05/07/86').
))BUL0006E Line ignored. Too many apostrophes (46, max).
         NOTICE must change apostrophes in your input into double
         apostrophes before passing the text along to MVS. When more
         than 46 apostrophes are used, the total line length is longer
         than the operating system can accept, so the text line cannot
         be placed into the TSO BROADCAST data-set.
         Revise the text and try again.
))BUL0007C CLEAR function ignored. Quantity less than 1.
         CLEAR(n) was used, and the value of 'n' was less than 1.
         Note that if you want to prevent clearing message lines, you
         should use NOCLEAR (which is the default) instead of CLEAR(0).
))BUL0008C Invalid "-dates " : format error or missing date.
         Check for correct start-end dates (they must be separated by
         at least one blank, and specified before card column 50).
