)F FUNCTION :  The MEMSTAT command is intended for use in CLISTs.
               It allows conditional execution based on whether a
               member exists in a given partitioned data-set (library).
        Note - MEMSTAT returns a condition code of 0 if the member
               exists in the library and, if not, a code of 4 is
               returned. Other condition codes are :
                 8 = a severe error occurred (message is given).
               The CLIST variable &LASTCC will contain the return code.
)X SYNTAX :    MEMSTAT  dsname(memname)  LIST
                                         NOLIST
               Example :  MEMSTAT  LIB.DATA(MEMBER)
)O OPERANDS :  Required - dsname(memname)
               Default  - None
))DSNAME :     The name of the library you wish to check.
))MEMNAME :    The name of the member you wish to check for in the
               library.
))LIST :       A message will be given with the member's status.
               This is the default if neither LIST nor NOLIST is
               entered.
))NOLIST :     No message will be given.
