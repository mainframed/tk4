  Purpose :    For TSO oper priviledge users, simulate an OS 3277
  ---------    console at their TSO tube by peeking at the DIDOCS
               console message buffers in CSA. DIDOCS accepts a reply
               from the user. Non-blank replies are formatted into a
               command and issued via svc 34, blank replies just cause
               the screen to be updated. Any commands issued via svc
               34 are also logged via a WTO so that your auditors and
               operations know what is going on.

  Command :    Syntax : DIDOCS OPMODE
  ---------
               OPMODE : if omitted, default is display commands,
                               with log, but depending on user
                               authority level.
                        SYSTEM or S : all commands (OS, JES2, CJS,
                               ...), with log, dut depending on
                               user authority level.
                        CASPER or GHOST : all commands with no log.
                        DEBUG or D : debug aid (PFK's 1-8-9-10-11).

               Exit from DIDOCS is via PFK-3 or PFK-12.
               Any existing active graphic operator's console may be
               selected at user TSO CRT (PFK-2).
               Operator's replies pending information in the system
               are displayed at user TSO CRT (PFK-5).
