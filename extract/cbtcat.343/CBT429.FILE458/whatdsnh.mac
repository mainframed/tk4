)F FUNCTION :  the WHATDSN command is intended for use in command
               procedures. This command returns to the CLIST the
               DSNAME(s) of the data-set(s) which is/are allocated
               to the DDNAME given.
               This command is used to pass back to the CLIST :
                  only the DSNAME of the data-set which is "at the
                  top of the stack" (if several data-sets are
                  concatenated to that DDNAME),
               or the DSNAME of each and every data-set (up to 99)
                  which are allocated to the DDNAME.
               This command will also return a return code representing
               the success or nonsuccess of this command :
               &LASTCC    Meaning
                  0       Successful completion
                  8       DDNAME not allocated
                 12       More than 99 data-sets concatenated to DDNAME
                 96       Invalid syntax of operand(s)
               Remark : if this command is invoked outside a CLIST, the
               -------- contents of all variables are displayed to the
                        terminal, and no CLIST variables are set.
)X SYNTAX :    WHATDSN DDNAME('ddname') ALL LIST
               Example : WHATDSN DDNAME(SYSPROC) ALL LIST
)O OPERANDS :  Required - DDNAME('ddname')
               Optional - ALL, LIST
               Default  - None
))DDNAME('ddname') : 'ddname' is the DDNAME for which you wish to know
               the data-set name.
               Aliases : DDN, DD, D, FILE, FI or F.
))ALL :        if ALL is given, this command will return all of the
               DSNAMEs which may be concatenated to the DDNAME in
               CLIST variables &DSNME1 through &DSNME99 and the CLIST
               variable &DSNSCNT will contain the total number of
               DSNAMEs associated with the DDNAME (&DSNSCNT may
               contain a value greater than 99).
               If ALL is NOT given, then only the DSNAME that is
               concatenated "at the top of the stack" is given. It is
               returned in the CLIST variable &DSNME.
))LIST :       force display to the terminal (CLIST variables not set).
