                             M O D L O O K

  Purpose : This program is designed to run as a TSO command, started
            task or a batch job to look up the selected module(s) in the
            system link list or link pack area. If the module is in the
            link list, the link list library name will be displayed. If
            the module is in the link pack area, its address will be
            displayed along with the name of the resident area in which
            it is located such as PLPA, FLPA, ECSA, etc. The first part
            of each module, unless it is in the LPA, is displayed also
            since it can contain date, time, or copyright information
            which may be of interest.

            When the program is run from TSO, the user will be prompted
            for module(s) name(s) and the response(s) will be displayed
            on the TSO user terminal. When it is run as a started task,
            a WTOR request will be made for the module(s) name(s) and
            the response(s) will be sent to the console. If it is run
            as a batch job, the module(s) name(s) will be entered in
            record(s) read from the SYSIN file and the response(s) will
            be written to the SYSPRINT file.

            The program will continue to ask for any other module(s)
            name(s) until end-of-file is reached on the SYSIN file for
            a batch job or a 'STOP', 'END', or '/*' is received from
            a TSO user or the operator console.


  Use :     1. Batch job :
                 //Jobname  JOB ...
                 //MODLOOK EXEC PGM=MODLOOK
                 //SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=*
                 //SYSIN     DD *
                 IDCAMS   ISPF
                 IEFW21SD
                 /*
            2. Started task :
                 //MODLOOK PROC
                 //MODLOOK EXEC PGM=MODLOOK
               After the operator entered the S MODLOOK command, he
               will be prompted for module(s) name(s) and the results
               will be written to the console.
            3. TSO user :
               Just enter MODLOOK at the READY prompt or under Option
               6 of ISPF.
               Message issued :
                 === ENTER "MODLOOK" MODULE(S) NAME(S) OR 'END' :
               This message prompts for any other module(s) name(s) to
               be used to search the link list or link pack area.
               If any response is 'STOP', 'END', or '/*', the program
               will terminate.
