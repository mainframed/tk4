   ------------

   Function : The TO command sends a message to a user at another
   ---------- terminal. It differs from the SEND command in that
              the text of the message is not in quotes, so you don't
              have to think about doubling quotes contained in your
              text. Also, this command cannot put a message in the
              user's broadcast mail.

   Syntax   : TO  USERID  MESSAGE
   ----------
   Examples - TO X99XXXX WHERE'S THAT REPORT?
              TO (Y99YYYY Z99ZZZZ) LET'S ME WRITE IT.
   Required - USERID and MESSAGE
   Defaults - none.
   ALIAS    - none.

   Operands :
   ----------
  USERID    -  one or more USERid's (enclosed between parentheses),
               to whom the message is to be sent.
