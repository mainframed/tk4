*        THING, CHANGE FROM SVC 232 TO WHATEVER NUMBER YOU HAVE.      *
*                                                                     *
*        AT THE BANK I WAS GETTING PASSWORD PROMPTS WHEN I OPENED THE *
*        CATALOG. RATHER THAN FIGURE OUT WHY I TURNED ON THE          *
*        "NO-PASSWORD" BIT IN THE JSCB. THIS MAY NOT BE NECESSARY IN  *
*        YOUR ENVIRONMENT AND, IF SO, YOU CAN TAKE OUT THE LOGIC.     *
*                                                                     *
*        THE HEX-DUMP LISTING CAN BE A SECURITY EXPOSURE AS WRITTEN   *
*        BECAUSE IT PRINTS OUT THE "SECURITY" CELL, IF PRESENT, WHICH *
*        CONTAINS THE PASSWORDS FOR PROTECTED OBJECTS. SECURITY       *
*        OFFICERS MAY NOT TAKE THAT IN THE NICEST SORT OF WAY!        *

*        NO ATTEMPT IS MADE TO DISCERN WHETHER SYSUT1 IS ACTUALLY AN  *

*        I WROTE THIS CODE IN THE WINTER OF 1983-1984 WHEN CBOC WAS   *
*        CONVERTING TO ICF CATALOGS. SINCE THE CONVERSION WENT MORE   *
*        SMOOTHLY THAN IT MIGHT HAVE DONE, I NEVER HAD A BROKEN       *
*        CATALOG TO WORK WITH. THEREFORE, THIS CODE ASSUMES A         *
*        VALIDLY STRUCTURED CATALOG. I MAKE NO GUARANTEES WHAT MIGHT  *
*        HAPPEN OTHERWISE.                                            *
