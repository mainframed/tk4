  CBT origin : extracted from CBT tape 87 FEB, file 296.
  ------------ This COMPARE program originated at YALE university and
               was obtained from the CONNECTICUT BANK AND TRUST company
               mods tape (file 226 of CBT tape).

  FUNCTION : this COMPARE program uses only columns 1 through 72, thus
      any two versions of a program may be easily compared even if one
      (or both) of the files has been resequenced. If neither file has
      been resequenced, a PARM of "FULL" may be coded to request that
      all 80 columns be used in the comparison. A facility is also
      provided to ignore trivial card images (such as " EJECT " or
      " SPACE 3 " in an assembler source program).
      This program uses all available core in its region after opening
      its input/output files (except for 4K which is released). The
      obtained core area is used as a compare buffer which is only
      dumped (written to SYSPRINT) when identical records (based on
      the first 72 bytes) are found in the OLD and NEW data-sets. If
      the compare buffer overflows, the program terminates. Therefore,
      if it is suspected that the two data-sets may be very far out of
      sync, a large region should be used. The number of unmatched
      records that can be buffered at one time can be calculated from
      the expression : (REGION SIZE - 8K - BUFFERS) / 160
      as a general rule, 30K is sufficient for about 100 unmatched
      records at a time, and 100K is sufficient for about 500 unmatched
      records at a time.

      Card images of the trivial data is input from the IGNORE DDname.
      If the DD-card is missing, a table of trivial data for assembler
      source code will be assumed (this includes " EJECT ", " SPACE   "
      " SPACE 1 ", " SPACE 2 ", " SPACE 3 " and blank comment cards).

      The program format on the CBT mods tape was disassembled source,
      it was recommented, resymbolized, redocumented and slightly
      modified by A. BRUCE LELAND (ABL), october, 1978.

  CHANGE :    if output is directed to a TSO terminal, only the first
              78 characters of each line are written. This may not be
              desirable if you have hard-copy terminals.

  JCL : //STEPNAME EXEC PGM=COMPAREB,REGION=100K
        //SYSPRINT   DD SYSOUT=A
        //OLD        DD DSN=... OLD.SEQ.DSN ...
        //NEW        DD DSN=... NEW.SEQ.DSN ...
        //IGNORE     DD *   (OR DUMMY -- OR OMITTED)
         Trivial card images that are to be ignored in the comparison.
