)F FUNCTION : THE CDSCB (CHANGE DSCB) COMMAND MODIFIES A DATA-SET'S
              FORMAT-1 DSCB IN A VTOC.
              SINCE THE FORMAT-1 DSCB CONTAINS INFORMATION CRUCIAL TO
              DATA-SETS SECURITY AND INTEGRITY, (AND IN FACT TO THE
              WHOLE SYSTEM'S SECURITY AND INTEGRITY), THIS COMMAND
              IS RESTRICTED TO SYSTEMS SUPPORT PERSONNEL.

)O OPERANDS : 'DSNAME'  -  THE NAME OF THE DATA-SET WHOSE FORMAT-1 DSCB
              IS TO BE MODIFIED.
))UNIT(UNIT)  : FOR UNCATALOGED DATA-SETS, THE UNIT TYPE OF THE VOLUME
                WHERE THE DATA-SET RESIDES.
))VOL(VOLUME) : FOR UNCATALOGED DATA-SETS, THE VOLUME SERIAL OF THE
                DATA-SET.
))SHR         : THIS KEYWORD INDICATES THAT THE DSCB IS TO BE MODIFIED
                EVEN IF ANOTHER JOB OR TSO SESSION IS USING THE
                DATA-SET.
))EXPDT('YYDDD') : THE EXPIRATION DATE IS TO BE SET TO THE SPECIFIED

                JULIAN DATE ('YYDDD' MUST BE EITHER A FIVE DIGIT
                JULIAN DATE, A ZERO, OR AN ASTERISK (TODAYS DATE).

                PASSWORD IS NEVER REQUIRED.

))ZAP(OFFSET VERDATA REPDATA) : THIS KEYWORD MAY BE USED TO MODIFY
                FIELDS WITHIN THE DSCB BY SPECIFYING (IN HEX) THE
                FIELD OFFSET, THE FIELD'S CURRENT VALUE (IN HEX), AND
                THE REPLACEMENT VALUE (IN HEX). IF THE CURRENT VALUE
                DOES NOT VERIFY CORRECTLY, THE DATA IS NOT REPLACED.
