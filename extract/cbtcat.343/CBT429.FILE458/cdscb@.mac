  CBT origin : Extracted from CBT tape 84 JUN, file 300.
  ------------

  Purpose :   The CDSCB (change DSCB) command modifies a data-set's
  ---------   format-1 DSCB in a VTOC.

  Authority : Since the format-1 DSCB contains information crucial to
  ----------- data-sets security and integrity (and in fact to the
              whole SYSTEM's security and integrity), this command
              is restricted to Systems Support personnel.

  Syntax :    CDSCB 'DSNAME' EXPDT('YYDDD')   SHR   VOL(VOLUME)
  --------                   UNIT(UNIT)   CREATE('YYDDD')

         Required - 'DSNAME'
         Defaults - nothing will happen if no changes are specified.
         ALIAS    - none

  Operands : 'DSNAME' - the name of the data-set whose format-1 DSCB
  ----------            is to be modified.
  UNIT(UNIT)  : for uncataloged data-sets, the UNIT TYPE of the volume
                where the data-set resides.
  VOL(VOLUME) : for uncataloged data-sets, the VOLUME SERIAL of the
                data-set.
  SHR         : this keyword indicates that the DSCB is to be modified
                even if another job or TSO session is using the
                data-set.
  EXPDT('YYDDD') : the EXPIRATION DATE is to be set to the specified
                Julian date ('YYDDD' must be either a five digit
                Julian date or a zero).
  CREATE('YYDDD') : the CREATION DATE is to be set to the specified
                Julian date ('YYDDD' must be either a five digit
                Julian date, a zero, or an asterisk (todays date).

  REFDT('YYDDD') : the REFERENCE DATE is to be set to the specified
                Julian date ('YYDDD' must be either a five digit
                Julian date, a zero, or an asterisk (todays date).
  DSORG(DSORG) : the DSORG is to be changed to the specified type.
  RECFM(RECFM) : the RECFM is to be changed to the specified type.
  LRECL(LRECL) : the LRECL is to be changed to the specified value.
  BLKSIZE(VALUE) : the BLKSIZE is to be changed to the specified value.
  PWR         : the PROTECTION FLAGS are to be set for PWREAD, meaning
                a password is required to read or write.
  PWW         : the PROTECTION FLAGS are to be set for PWWRITE, meaning
                a password is required to write but not to read.
  NOP         : the PROTECTION FLAGS are to be set off, meaning a
                password is never required.
  RACF        : the data-set is to be marked RACF protected.
  NORACF      : the data-set is to be marked NOT RACF protected.
  ZAP(OFFSET VERDATA REPDATA) : this keyword may be used to modify
                fields within the DSCB by specifying (in HEX) the
                field offset, the field's current value (in HEX), and
                the replacement value (in HEX). If the current value
                does not verify correctly, the data is not replaced.
                The REPDATA may be omitted if you just want to verify.
  LIST        : display the Format 1 DSCB.
  NOLIST      : don't display the Format 1 DSCB.
  FULL        : fully display the Format 1 DSCB.
