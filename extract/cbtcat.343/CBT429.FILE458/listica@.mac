  NAME         LISTICAT

  FUNCTION     List the contents of an ICF catalog and selected
               DSCB and VVDS fields.

  DESCRIPTION  The UCBs of all online DASD volumes are located and
               an attempt is made to allocate SYS1.VVDS.VVOLSER.
               If this works an ACB and RPL are generated and their
               addresses are saved in a lookup table.
               The BCS cluster is opened as a dataset and read
               sequentially. The BCS records are scanned for cell
               types and the following cells are listed :

                   NONVSAM             AIX
                   CLUSTER             PATH
                   INDEX               GDG BASE
                   DATA                GDG ENTRY
1   08/12/88
                                                      LISTICAT  2/4.

               For NONVSAM entries the FORMAT 1 and, if it exists the
               FORMAT 3, DSCB is "OBTAINed" to determine if the
               object exists. If it does the LRECL, BLKSIZE and
               total tracks allocated are extracted.
               If the object is catalogued to VOLSER "MIGRAT" the
               HSM MIGRATIONCONTROLDATASET is opened (SYSUT2) and
               used instead of the VTOC.

               For DATA and INDEX entries the VVDS of the volume in
               question, if available, is scanned to determine the
               LRECL, BLKSIZE and track allocation of the object.

  ENVIRONMENT  MVS/XA 2.2.0                                        -EU-

  INPUT        The BCS of the ICF catalog to be listed.

  OUTPUT       Output consists of a listing of the catalog.

                    DSNAME - the name of the component being listed.
                         For GDG entries this is developed into the
                         format that would be in a FORMAT1 DSCB.

                    TYPE - the type of the cell being listed.

                    VOLUME - the VOLSER of the volume to which the
                         object is cataloged. Filled in only for
                         NONVSAM, DATA, INDEX and GDG entries.

                    UNIT - the name of the unit to which the
                         object is cataloged. Filled in only for
                         NONVSAM, DATA, INDEX and GDG entries.

                    TRKS - the number of tracks allocated to a DASD
                         resident object. Left blank for cataloged,
                         NON-EXISTING and TAPE-RESIDENT objects.

                    BLKSZ - the physical block size of the object.
                         Left blank for cataloged,
                         NON-EXISTING and TAPE-RESIDENT objects.

                    LRECL - the logical record length of the object.
                         Left blank for cataloged,
                         NON-EXISTING and TAPE-RESIDENT objects.

  CONSIDERATIONS - ABEND CODES :

                    U0014 - BCS cluster failed to OPEN.

  EXECUTION    DDNAMEs

               STEPCAT  defines the ICF catalog to be listed.
               SYSUT1   defines the ICF catalog to be listed.
               SYSUT2   defines the HSM MIGRATIONCONTROLDATASET.
                        If you don't have HSM this can be left out.
               SYSPRINT defines the output listing data set.
               SYSLIST  defines the messages listing data set.

  EXAMPLE      //LCAT   EXEC  PGM=LISTICAT
               //STEPCAT  DD  DSN=ICF.CATALOG,DISP=OLD
               //SYSUT1   DD  DSN=ICF.CATALOG,DISP=OLD
               //SYSUT2   DD  DSN=HSM.MCDS,DISP=OLD
               //SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
               //SYSLIST  DD  SYSOUT=*
               //SYSUDUMP DD  SYSOUT=*

  AUTHOR       This portions of this program having to do with
               passing the BCS and VVDS's were written by J. LANE
               at CBOC. A lot of the rest of the code has been
               borrowed from various sources, mostly off the CBT
               tape. If something in here looks like you wrote it,
               you probably did.


  NOTES  A program must be APF-authorized in MVS to open a catalog
         as a dataset. I do this with a user SVC. If you have such a
         thing, change from SVC 232 to whatever number you have.

         At the bank I was getting password prompts when I opened the
         catalog. Rather than figure out why I turned on the
         "NO-PASSWORD" bit in the JSCB. This may not be necessary in
         your environment and, if so, you can take out the logic.

         The HEX-DUMP listing can be a security exposure as written
         because it prints out the "SECURITY" cell, if present, which
         contains the passwords for protected objects. Security
         officers may not take that in the nicest sort of way.

         No attempt is made to discern whether SYSUT1 is actually an
         ICF catalog or not. If, inadvertently, it isn't this code
         will probably loop.

         I wrote this code in the winter of 1983-1984 when CBOC was
         converting to ICF catalogs. Since the conversion went more
         smoothly than it might have done, I never had a broken
         catalog to work with. Therefore, this code assumes a
         validly structured catalog. I make no guarantees what might
         happen otherwise.

  CHANGE ACTIVITY SUMMARY :

     @122    - Added extra diagnostic checking and messages to handle
               problem reported by R. DIETES of H.E. BUTT GROCERY CO.
               Situation was the case where the BCS info exists, the
               VVDS exists but it doesn't contain anything to match
               the dataset found in the BCS.
               Fix was to sense END OF FILE reached while scanning
               the VVDS for the VVR of a cluster component, produce
               message about VVR not found when expected and pass a
               return code to the caller.
             - Add 3480 device type support.
             - Test HSM logic with DFHSM 2.1.0
             - Close MCDS at EOJ if it was opened.
     @121    - Was assuming an 8-character catalog name for the
               title line.
     @120    - Changes for MVS/XA. Use scan routine instead of
               UCB half-word lookup table.
             - LENGTHEN PRINTLINE area used for printing totals to
               correct formatting problem.
             - Break out some parts of the code into copy members to
               make it more editable.
             - An RPL was not being created prior to I/O in the
               HEX-PRINT part of the logic.
             - Add cell type counting to HEX logic.
     24APR25 - Bugs found after author's move to MANULIFE.
             . 3380 missing from device type table.
             . dont be so sure I know how many tracks there are in a
               cylinder. At CBOC I had only 3375's.
     24APR87 - Replaced the device code name table by routine     -EU-
               DVTYUN which retrieves dynamically the unit name   -EU-
               from the device type, and get through the CVTZDTAB -EU-
               the number of tracks per cylinder info.            -EU-
             . Test if opened SYSUT1 is an ICF catalog.           -EU-
