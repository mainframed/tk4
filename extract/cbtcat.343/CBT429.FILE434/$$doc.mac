 EDIT Macros:
   Copy the macro to any library in the SYSPROC concatenation.
   If the macro is a REXX, it can also be placed in any library
   in the SYSEXEC concatenation.

 REXX EXECs/CLISTs:
   Copy the EXEC or CLIST to any library in the SYSPROC concatenation.
   REXX programs can also be placed in any library in the SYSEXEC
   concatenation.

   Many of the REXX EXECs and CLISTS are best used when set up as ISPF
   commands. The ISPCMDSA CLIST is an example of how to add these
   commands on a temporary basis without actually modifying the ISPF
   Command Table (ISPCMDS). This also allows you to create aliases or
   command abbbreviations without renaming the CLIST/EXEC.

 eXtended Editor Facility (XEF):
   XEF is an ISPF dialog application that is used for BROWSING,
   VIEWING, EDITING, or COMPRESSING a dataset. It allows you to
   choose a dataset from a menu instead of typing in the entire dataset
   name. XEF can also be used to obtain DATASET INFORMATION or
   display a DATASET MEMBER LIST of a partitioned dataset. From the
   member list you can select members to be BROWSEd, VIEWed, EDITed,
   DELETEd, RENAMEd, or PRINTed. XEF can also be used to interface
   with the CBT PDS command.

   XEF is invoked by selecting the main menu panel - XEFMENU. It can be
   added to an existing ISPF option panel or is best used when set up as
   command in the ISPF Command Table (ISPCMDS). The ISPCMDSA
   CLIST in this PDS has an example of how to add the XEF command on a
   temporary basis without actually modifying the ISPF Command Table.

 XEF Installation Instructions:

   Add the following CLISTs to a library in the SYSPROC concatenation:
      XEFCLIST - XEF mainline code
      XEF      - REXX EXEC to invoke XEF (optional if using ISPF command
                                          tables or an option menu to
                                          invoke XEF)

   Add the following panels to a library in the ISPPLIB concatenation:
      XEFMENU  - XEF Main Menu
      XEFHELP  - XEF Help Panel #1
      XEFHELP2 - XEF Help Panel #2
      XEFHELP3 - XEF Help Panel #3
      XEFHELP4 - XEF Help Panel #4
      XEFINF   - XEF Dataset Info Panel (SEQ)
      XEFINFD  - XEF Dataset Info Panel (PDS)
      XEFINFE  - XEF Dataset Info Panel (PDSE)
      XEFINFP  - XEF Dataset Info Panel (PDS SMS)
      XEFINFS  - XEF Dataset Info Panel (SEQ SMS)

   Add the following messages to a library in the ISPMLIB concatenation:
      XEF00    - XEF Messages

 Sample ISPF Commands, Command Usage, and Edit Macro Usage

 The commands are activated by updating the ISPF Command table.  The
 abbreviations for commands and edit macros are achieved by using the
 command table or by renaming EXECs/CLISTSs.  The ISPCMDSA CLIST is an
 example of how to add these commands on a temporary basis without
 actually modifying the ISPF Command Table (ISPCMDS).
