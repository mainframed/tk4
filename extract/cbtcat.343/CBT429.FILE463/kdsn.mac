)F FUNCTION
 THE KDSN COMMAND ACQUIRES A LIST OF DATASET NAMES CURRENTLY ALLOCATED
 TO ANY GIVEN DDNAME.  THE COMMAND CAN THEN DISPLAY THE INFORMATION, OR
 SAVE THE INFORMATION FOR USE IN REALLOCATING THE DDNAME.

))'DDLIST' - ONE OR MORE DDNAMES TO INTERROGATE.  PARENDS REQUIRED ONLY
             WHEN MORE THAN ONE DDNAME IS ENTERED.
))SAVE     - ROUTE DATASET-NAME INFORMATION TO A DYNAMICALLY-CREATED
             TEMPORARY DATASET.
))RESET    - USE THE INFORMATION STORED BY A PREVIOUS "KDSN ... SAVE"
             TO RE-ESTABLISH THE ORIGNAL DATASET ALLOCATION(S) TO THE
             'DDLIST' DDNAMES.  NOTE: IF THERE WAS NO PRECEDING "SAVE"
             FOR A DDNAME, OR IF THE "SAVED" ALLOCATION CANNOT BE
             RESTORED, THE CURRENT ALLOCATION IS RETAINED.

 SPECIAL NOTES:
 "SAVE" PROCESSING CREATES AN TEMPORARY DATASET, DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATED
 TO THE DDNAME "KDSNXX.." (WHERE ".." REPRESENTS A NUMBER FROM "1 " TO
 "99").  THERE WILL BE ONE DATASET FOR EACH ENTRY IN 'DDLIST'.  THIS
 INFORMATION WILL BE LOST IF THE USER PERFORMS A "FREE ALL" FUNCTION
 BETWEEN THE TIME OF A "KDSN/SAVE" AND A "KDSN/RESET".

 THERE IS ONE VARIABLE-LENGTH RECORD ON EACH DATASET,
 IN THE FOLLOWING FORMAT:
 BYTES 1-8  : ORIGINAL DDNAME (WITH TRAILING BLANKS)
 BYTES 9-228: DATASET NAMES (STANDARD TSO SYNTAX) SEPARATED BY BLANKS
              ("*" FOR TERMINAL ALLOCATIONS).

 SAMPLE CLIST TO RECREATE DDNAME1-ALLOCATION UNDER DDNAME2:
   KDSN DDNAME1 SAVE
   SET &LCC = &LASTCC - 100
   IF &LCC > 0 THEN DO
     OPENFILE KDSNXX&LCC
     GETFILE  KDSNXX&LCC                    /* GET FIRST RECORD */
     SET &X = &&KDSNXX&LCC                  /* COPY FIRST RECORD */
     CLOSFILE KDSNXX&LCC
     FREE FI(KDSNXX&LCC)                    /* CLEAN UP "SAVE" DS */
     SET &DSNS = &SUBSTR(9:&LENGTH(&X),&X)  /* EXTRACT DSNAMES */
     ALLOC FI(DDNAME2) DA(&DSNS) SHR REUSE
     END
