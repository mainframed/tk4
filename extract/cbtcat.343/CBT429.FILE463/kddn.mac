))'DSNAME-LIST' -
             ONE OR MORE DSNAMES TO INTERROGATE (STANDARD TSO SYNTAX);
             PARENDS REQUIRED ONLY WHEN MORE THAN ONE DSNAME ENTERED.
))SAVE     - ROUTE DDNAME INFORMATION TO A DYNAMICALLY-CREATED
             TEMPORARY DATASET.

 SPECIAL NOTES:
 "SAVE" PROCESSING CREATES AN TEMPORARY DATASET, DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATED
 TO THE DDNAME "KDDNXX.." (WHERE ".." REPRESENTS A NUMBER FROM "1 " TO
 "99").  THERE WILL BE ONE DATASET FOR EACH ENTRY IN 'DSNLIST'.  THIS
 INFORMATION WILL BE LOST IF THE USER PERFORMS A "FREE ALL" FUNCTION
 BEFORE INTERROGATING THE DATASET(S).

 EACH DATASET CONTAINS AT LEAST 2 RECORDS, IN THE FOLLOWING FORMAT:
 (RECORD 1:)
 BYTES 1-44 : DATASET NAME    (WITH TRAILING BLANKS)
 (RECORDS 2 THRU N:)
 BYTES 1-8  : DDNAME
 BYTES 11-13: CONCATENATION SEQUENCE NUMBER (OR BLANK)

 SAMPLE CLIST TO RETRIEVE 1ST ALLOCATED DDNAME FOR PROCESSING:
   KDDN &DSNAME SAVE
   SET &LCC = &LASTCC - 100
   IF &LCC > 0 THEN DO
     OPENFILE KDDNXX&LCC
     GETFILE  KDDNXX&LCC                    /* GET FIRST RECORD */
     GETFILE  KDDNXX&LCC                    /* GET SECOND RECORD */
     SET &X = &&KDDNXX&LCC                  /* COPY SECOND RECORD */
     CLOSFILE KDDNXX&LCC
     FREE FI(KDDNXX&LCC)                    /* CLEAN UP "SAVE" DS */
     SET &DDN1 = &SUBSTR(1:8,&X)            /* EXTRACT DDNAME  */
     END
