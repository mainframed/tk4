             ONE OR MORE DDNAME(MEMBERNAME) OPERANDS.  OUTER PARENDS

))SAVE     - ROUTE DATASET-NAME INFORMATION TO A DYNAMICALLY-CREATED
             TEMPORARY DATASET.

 SPECIAL NOTES:
 "SAVE" PROCESSING CREATES AN TEMPORARY DATASET, DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATED
 TO THE DDNAME "KLIBXX.." (WHERE ".." REPRESENTS A NUMBER FROM "1 " TO
 "99").  THERE WILL BE ONE DATASET FOR EACH ENTRY IN THE "PAIRS" LIST
 THIS INFORMATION WILL BE LOST IF THE USER PERFORMS A "FREE ALL"
 FUNCTION AFTER THE TIME OF A "KLIB ... SAVE".

 EACH DATASET CONTAINS AT LEAST 2 RECORDS, IN THE FOLLOWING FORMAT:
 (RECORD 1:)
 BYTES 1-8  : MEMBER NAME     (WITH TRAILING BLANKS)
 BYTES 9-16 : ORIGINAL DDNAME (WITH TRAILING BLANKS)
 (RECORDS 2 THRU N:)
 BYTES 1-47 : ONE DATASET NAME, FULLY QUALIFIED (WITHOUT QUOTES).

 SAMPLE CLIST TO RETRIEVE 1ST DSNAME FOR PROCESSING:
   KLIB &DDNAME(&MEMBER) SAVE
   SET &LCC = &LASTCC - 100
   IF &LCC > 0 THEN DO
     OPENFILE KLIBXX&LCC
     GETFILE  KLIBXX&LCC                    /* GET FIRST RECORD */
     GETFILE  KLIBXX&LCC                    /* GET SECOND RECORD */
     SET &X = &&KLIBXX&LCC                  /* COPY SECOND RECORD */
     CLOSFILE KLIBXX&LCC
     FREE FI(KLIBXX&LCC)                    /* CLEAN UP "SAVE" DS */
     SET &SYSDVAL = &SUBSTR(1:&LENGTH(&X),&X)  /* EXTRACT DSNAME  */
     READDVAL &DSN1                         /* TRUNCATE EXTRA BLANKS */
     SET &DSN1 = &STR('&DSN1')
     END
