   ACFXPIRE                        An updated version of my original
                                   ACF2 Logonid Expiration utility
                                   program that new uses the ACF2
                                   EXTENDED Alter Request Entry
                                   (ARE) control block structure
                                   recommended by the vendor.

                                   At the end of all Logonid expiration
                                   this program now has added logic
                                   to issue an operator command to
                                   perform an ACF2 BACKUP operation.

                                   NOTE: The JCL to execute this
                                         program must specify
                                         FREE=CLOSE for the //LIDS
                                         DDNAME since ACF2 must
                                         have sole control of
                                         the sequential backup
                                         Logonid database file.

                                   This version of the program no
                                   longer has the report associated
                                   with it of what Logonids will be
                                   expired.  The report has been split
                                   out to a separate program at my
                                   company since its use is minimal
                                   with our security department.
                                   SEE PROGRAM ACFEXPDT BELOW.


   ACFVIOS                         ACF2 utility program that will
                                   copy the ACF2 security violation
                                   counter (SEC-VIO) to user-defined
                                   fields and will SUSPEND any logonid
                                   with 6 or more violations.  See
                                   the code for more information.

   IVP3480                         Some changes to my 3480 cartridge
                                   installation verification procedure:

                        - Change the DATA BUFFER from 24K to 32K.
                          32K IS THE HIGHEST BLOCK SIZE YOU CAN USE.

                        - Added EQUATE of DCBOPTW to DCBBIT0 after use
                          of DCBD MACRO DSECT to indicate WRITE VALIDITY
                          CHECK for 3480 devices.

                        - Set EQUATE for TAPE-WRITE-IMMEDIATE MODE
                          to DCBOPTW from DCBBIT0 for better program
                          understanding.

                        - Add additional SYNCDEV MACRO after we are in
                          TAPE-WRITE-IMMEDIATE MODE to inquire about
                          number of data blocks.

                        - issue a return code message on the LAST CLOSE
                          of this program.

                        - corrected comments where possible for clarity.


   ACFEXPDT                        This is a simulation version of
                                   the ACFXPIRE program that will
                                   produce a report of what logonids
                                   will be expired by the ACFXPIRE
                                   program.


   USERCFDE                        This is our ACF2 user @CFDE entries
                                   needed for the ACFVIOS utility
                                   program.


   USERLID                         This is our ACF2 user Logonid fields
                                   needed for the ACFVIOS utility
                                   program.


       NOTE:  See the comments in the code for more information.



       I have made some corrections and additions to items currently
    on the SHARE CBT tape.  They are as follows:



    Entry                 Change(s)
+   ______________        ______________________________________



    MCS                   Added VTAM fullscreen support in order
                          to not have NOTIFY messages written
                          over a fullscreen display.

                          Added code to save the old,original
                          authorization index value in register
                          0 after the AXSET instruction in order
                          to reset the authorization index back
                          to what it was.  You would think the
                          AXFRE would do it - it doesn't.


    IEFUTL                Added code to IEFUTL to allows batch jobs
                          with a tape mount pending to be allowed
                          a different time extension than TSO
                          sessions or non-tape-mount-pending jobs.


    IGGPRE00              Added a simulated ACF2 WARN mode via use
                          of the $USERDATA rule entry field.

                          Corrected intermittent ABEND S0C4s by
                          correcting every use of the WKADSCT (dsect)
                          to use r13 and not r4  (I was dropping
                          72 bytes this way indexing into the
                          WTOANSW user WTO area).  The WTOANSW
                          user WTO area was enlarged to 200 bytes
                          from 100 bytes as a safety valve.

                          Loading of a second base register was
                          short by 1 byte.
