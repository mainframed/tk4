INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR "JSTATUS" COMMAND:

The JSTATUS command will search the JES2 queues and present a short
job status display. This command can be used in place of the present
STATUS command, on TSO, or can be seperately installed. I have chosen
to call this command JSTATUS to avoid conflict with the command
supplied by IBM.

To REPLACE the STATUS command:

  (1) DELETE  ST,STATUS,IKJEFFCA from 'SYS1.CMDLIB'

  (2) EDIT 'node.JS.PDS(#JSASM)' DA O
      VERIFY ON
      FIND /JSTATUS(R)/
      CHANGE * /JSTATUS/STATUS/
      TOP
      FIND /ALIAS JS/
      CHANGE * /JS/ST/
      END SAVE

To install this command with the "JSTATUS" name (alias JS) perform
the following tasks:

  (1) RENAME this file to "node".JS.PDS
      "node" is a valid high-level name at your installation

  (2) CHOOSE a valid SVC number for the JSTATUS user SVC.  This
      may be any empty TYPE 3 or TYPE 4 SVC slot in your SVC
      table. Please note that this SVC will be an ALIAS of the
      JSTATUS command. The SVC simply provides for the
      scheduling of an SRB in the JES2 address space.
      The supplied SVC number is "208". If that number is
      valid for your installation, then proceed to step 4.

  (3) IF you have chosen a number other than SVC 208 for the JS
      SVC, perform the following tasks:

       ====>     standard TSO edit:

        (a) EDIT 'node.JS.PDS(#JSASM)' DA O
            VERIFY ON
            CHANGE 0 99999999 /IGC0020H/IGC00xxx/ALL
            (xxx is the signed SVC number you have chosen)
            END SAVE

        (b) EDIT 'node.JS.PDS(IGC0020H)' DA O
            VERIFY ON
            CHANGE 0 99999999 /SVC 208/SVC xxx/ALL
            (xxx is the SVC number you have chosen)
            END SAVE

        (c) EDIT 'node.JS.PDS(JSTATUS)' DA O
            VERIFY ON
            CHANGE 0 99999999 /SVC 208/SVC xxx/ALL
            END SAVE

        (d) EDIT 'node.JS.PDS(RECEVSRB)' DA O
            VERIFY ON
            CHANGE 0 99999999 /SVC 208/SVC xxx/ALL
            END SAVE

        ======>         ISPF edit:

        Under ISPF simply EDIT and CHANGE the modules
        IGC0020H, JSTATUS, and RECEVSRB as mentioned above
        for standard TSO edit, but using the ISPF/PDF facility.

        (e) Under TSO "READY" mode:
            RENAME 'node.JS.PDS(IGC0020H)' 'node.JS.PDS(IGC00xxx)'
            (xxx is the signed SVC number you have chosen)


  (4) EDIT the "#JSASM" member and modify the JOB information to
      reflect your ACCOUNTING and PRINT QUEUE standards. All system
      output is directed to the MESSAGE CLASS, so you will have
      to change the JSASM proc and the LKED step if you want the
      output to go somewhere else.

  (5) MODIFY the "SYSLMOD" statment int the LKED step if you do
      not want JSTATUS to be installed in SYS1.LPALIB. It will
      have to be copied there eventually though.

      NOTE: JSTATUS MUST RUN FROM SYS1.LPALIB
            (the LOAD MODULE uses only 6K of storage)

  (6) SUBMIT the '#JSASM' member of 'node.JS.PDS'

  (7) COPY JS, JSTATUS, IGC0020H, FINDASCB to 'SYS1.LPALIB'
      if you did not LINK into that library.

  (8) IPL the system with a CLPA to complete the installation process

  (9) JSTATUS is now installed.
