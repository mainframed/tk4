)F  FUNCTION -

  The JSTATUS command is used to find the status of JOB(S)
  previously submitted to the background either through TSO,
  a card reader, or an MVS internal reader. The status of
  started tasks and TSO users may also be listed.

  JSTATUS will search the JOB queue by using the characters
  supplied in a 'JOBLIST'. For example, if you only asked for
  2he status of JOB 'A', then JSTATUS would return to your
  terminal the status of all the JOB(S) whose JOBNAME(S) begin
  with the character 'A'.

  JSTATUS may also be run under the TSO tmp in batch mode,
  however the 'JOBLIST' operand must be entered in this mode,
  because when running TSO tmp in batch, no user id is
  associated with the JOB.

  JSTATUS may be used with an alternate JES2 subsystem. in
  that case, the 'JOBLIST' operand must be entered rather
  that letting your user id be supplied by default.

)X SYNTAX  -

        JSTATUS   (JOBLIST) 'SUBSYSTEM NAME'

  REQUIRED - NONE

  DEFAULTS - If no (JOBLIST) is given, JSTATUS will
             search the queues for JOB(S) beginning with
             your user id. Otherwise, for each (JOBLIST)
             entry, JSTATUS will return status for JOB(S)
             beginning with the characters entered. If
             a SUBSYSTEM NAME is supplied, then a JOBLIST
             must be supplied. It will not default to your
             user id in that case.

             if no 'SUBSYSTEM NAME' is given the JSTATUS will
             search the queues of the subsystem named 'JES2'.
             otherwise the queues of the alternate JES2 will
             be searched.

  ALIAS    - JS

)O OPERANDS -

))(JOBLIST)- List of JOBS, or search arguments
             seperated by blanks or commas.

           - The parentheses aren't needed when one
             JOB or search argument is specified.

))SUBSYSTEM NAME
           The name of a JES2 subsystem whose queues are to be
           searched for the list of JOBNAME(S) supplied.  The
           default is 'JES2'. You may specify any subsytem
           name that is a valid alternate 'JES2' subsystem.

           If this operand is supplied, then the JOBLIST must
           be supplied. It will not default to your user id.
