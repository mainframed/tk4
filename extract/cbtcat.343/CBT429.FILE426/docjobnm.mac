    This file contains the source for the JOBNAME processor and
    a local mod to update IEEVJCL and MSTRJCL00 so that
    accounting information can be placed in started tasks. If
    a member in the 'SYS1.JOBNAME' pds exists, the JCL from that
    member is inserted after the JOBCARD generated by Started
    Task Control.

    Accounting information can be placed on started tasks simply
    by continuing the system generated JOBCARD as follows:

    line 1 -  //    (XXXXX,XXXXX),MSGCLASS=A
    line 2 -  /*JOBPARM L=999,ROOM=A539
    line 3 -  /*ROUTE PRINT RMT99
    line 4 -  /*NOTIFY  $UHMD

    note that the accounting info must appear on the first
    JOBCARD and the space after the two slashes indicates a
    continuation.

    Each separate started task can have its own member in
    'SYS1.JOBNAME'. If the member does not exist, the STC
    behaves exactly as without the mod. End-of-file indicates
    the JCL generation should be ceased and the STC started.
