//***FILE 396 is from Scott Hawley of Indianapolis, Indiana,        *
//*           and contains a very handy REXX exec to do a quick     *
//*           text search of a pds from an ISPF 3.4 panel.  The     *
//*           name of the exec is FINDSTR, and it invokes           *
//*           ISRSUPC to do the text search.                        *
//*                                                                 *
//*           This little widget has been VERY nice to have.        *
//*           It's meant to be used with the 3.4 panel as a line    *
//*           command.  I hate having to do the old cut/bounce      *
//*           to 3.14/paste game.  The way it's written you can     *
//*           simply say FINDSTR A HAPPY SYSPROG (no quotes) as     *
//*           a line command and a pds search is done with          *
//*           ISRSUPC for the phrase 'A HAPPY SYSPROG'.             *
//*                                                                 *
