Sam, I just put together this little widget that has been VERY hay to
have. It's meant to be used with the 3.4 panel as a line command. I hate
having to do the old cut/bounce to 3.14/paste game. The way it's written
you can simply say FINDSTR A HAPPY SYSPROG (no quotes) as a line command
and a pds search is done with ISRSUPC for the phrase 'A HAPPY SYSPROG'.

  Thanks,
                        ----------------------
