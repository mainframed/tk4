I've updated $$FILE2 to properly refit the IPOUPDTE zap, which
allows IPOUPDTE to run against any pds, not only one which has
an $$$COIBM member.

    (Refitted for newer version of IPOUPDTE -- original 1978
     version was different.)

Added CPPUPDTE member to $$FILE2 to do the corresponding zap for
CPPUPDTE which comes with the ServerPac.
