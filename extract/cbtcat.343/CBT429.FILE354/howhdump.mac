  HDUMP is a macro/program  used to dynamically dump memory in a
  running program. It can be used to help determine what is going on
  in the data portion and the registers at specific points in the
  program. It can be a usefull debugging tool for obscure problems.

  HDUMP is used as follows:

  A) To include HDUMP in the source program.....

     1) Add RH87944.SOURCE.CNTL to the SYSLIB dd....
     2) Add a COPY HDUMP assembler statement at the beginning of the
        program. NOTE...you cannot use register 13 as a base register
        if you use HDUMP.
     3) Add an HDUMP macro to the source at the point you want the
        dump to be taken.

         HDUMP &DCB,&START,&STOP,&DISPO,&DISPC,&V=NO,&TITLE=

               &DCB   is the name for the output DD and dcb.
               &START is a register containing the address to dump
               &STOP  is the length to dump, max is 4095
               &DISPO is the disposition of the dump dcb
                      OPEN....The dcb is already open. The dcb will
                              ALWAYS be opened at the first call to
                              HDUMP. This would be use for subsequent
                              invocations of HDUMP.
                      Anything else means issue an OPEN for the dcb.
               &DISPC is the disposition at the end of the macro
                      OPEN....The dcb is to be left open for more
                              calls to HDUMP.
                      CLOSE...This is the last invocation of HDUMP.
                              Close the dcb.
               &V=YES will generate a control block set(except dcb)
                      every time the macro is called
               &TITLE is a title to be printed before the dump

         An example usage would be:

         1)    Dump 1024 bytes starting at label MESSAGES (a dcb)..
               The 'OUTDCB' file is not open, and should be left
               open at the end of the macro.

              LA    R3,MESSAGES        R3 = ADDRESS TO DUMP       DEBUG
              HDUMP OUTDCB,R3,1024,NOTOPEN,OPEN                   DEBUG
              ...
              ...   more of your code
              ...

         2)    Dump 1024 bytes starting at the address stored
               at MESSAGES+44. (a deb)
               The 'OUTDCB' file is open, and should be closed
               at the end of the macro.

              L     R3,MESSAGES+44     R3 -> TO DEB               DEBUG
              HDUMP OUTDCB,R3,1024,OPEN,CLOSE                     DEBUG

         3)    Dump the just the registers...

              HDUMP OUTDCB,0,0,TITLE='DUMP JUST THE REGS"         DEBUG


  B) To activate HDUMP at execution time.....

     1) Concatenate HALL.LINKLIB to the STEPLIB dd..
     2) Add a //&DCB  DD SYSOUT=  jcl statement.
        ...eg....//OUTDCB DD SYSOUT=A
        If you have an open output dcb, such as SYSPRINT, you can ADD
        HDUMP output to it.

     NOTE. If you forget these, you will not get any output.
