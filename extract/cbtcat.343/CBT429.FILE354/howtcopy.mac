-          The program TAPECOPY is used to produce a formatted report on
           the files on a tape.

           It can also be used to copy all or specific files of the inpu
           file to an output file.

-
           TAPECOPY can be used for the following purposes:

           1) It can be used to print information about data sets on
              a tape, or,
           2) It can be used to print information and to copy data
              sets from one tape to 1 or more output tapes, or,
           3) It can be used to copy data sets from an input tape
              to 1 or more output tapes without printing any
              information, or,
           4) It can be used to reset the block count in the trailer
              label of a tape that is causing 237 abends. This is
              automatically done when the tape is copied to a
              new tape. A message will be printed showing the old
              block count and the new count, or,
           5) It can  be used to print records from each file on
              the tape in a hexadecimal or a standard print format.

                              JCL Statements
+                             ___ __________


           The following JCL is required to run TAPECOPY:

           //COPY    EXEC PGM=TAPECOPY,PARM='parameters'
           //STEPLIB   DD DSN=HALL.LINKLIB,DISP=SHR
           //SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=A
           //MASTER    DD UNIT=TAPE,DISP=OLD,DSN=first.data.set.name,
           //             VOL=SER=if not cataloged

           The above JCL is all that is necessary if PARM='DEBE'
           is coded.

           If PARM='DUMP' is coded, the following JCL must be added
           to that above:

           //TAPE1     DD DSN=any.valid.data.set.name,
           //             UNIT=TAPE,DISP=(NEW,CATLG or KEEP)

           If 2 copies of the MASTER tape are required, add the
           following JCL:

           //TAPE2     DD DSN=any.valid.data.set.name,
           //             UNIT=TAPE,DISP=(NEW,CATLG or KEEP)

           A valid data set name must be supplied on the TAPE1 and
           TAPE2 DD statements if LABEL=SL (the default) is used,
           otherwise the system will not keep the tape.

           If DSN= is coded on the MASTER jcl statement, the job
           can be run in CLASS=A
           If the dsn of the first data set you want is not known,
           LABEL=(,BLP) must be added to the //MASTER jcl and the
           job must be run in CLASS=Z

           NOTE ...
           Unless otherwize specified, DCB information for NL and BLP
           MASTER tapes defaults to :
           DCB=(DSORG=PS,RECFM=FB,LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=32000)

+                             __________
0
           The following parameters can be coded in the PARM= field:

             DEBE - This causes information only to be printed

             DUMP - This causes information to be printed and the
                    tape to be copied

          NEWVOL= - The specified 6 character volume serial number
                    will be put on the output tapes

            COPY= - Indicates which files are to be processed from
                    the input MASTER tape.
                    if COPY=x is coded, files 1 through x will be
                    processed.
                    If COPY=(x,y) is coded, files x through y will
                    be processed.
          NEWSEQ= - If the files are to be copied to the output
                    tapes, the starting output file sequence number
                    can be specified with NEWSEQ=.
                    A maximum of 4 characters can be specified.
                    the default starting sequence will be the
                    sequence number specified in the LABEL=
                    parameter on the //TAPE1 JCL statement.

           NODUMP - If NODUMP is specified, the complete MASTER tape
                    will be copied to the output tapes and no
                    information will be printed.
                    No file sequence checking will be done.
                    All input files will be copied from the input tape
                    to all output tapes.

         IGNOREOF - If the MASTER tape has been written over, IGNOREOF
                    will cause TAPECOPY to ignore the first end of
                    file it encounters and to continue reading the tape.

                    ... NOTE ...
                    If there is only 1 eof on the tape, IGNOREOF will
                    cause TAPECOPY to read off the end of the reel.


             TEST - Will cause the following events to occur :

                    The message 'TAPE MARK READ' to be printed
                    when a tape mark is read on the input tape.

                    The message 'TAPE MARK WRITTEN AFTER .... RECORDS'
                    to be printed when a tape mark is written on
                    the output tapes.

                    If the PRINT= parm is supplied, label records
                    will be printed.

           RENAME - Indicates that the dataset name on the output
                    file is to be changed. The new file name will
                    be obtained from 1 of 2 sources...
                      1) If the MASTER tape contains only 1 file,
                         the new dataset name may be obtained from
                         the DSN specified on the JCL for the TAPE1
                         or the TAPE2 DD statement.
                         If TAPE1 and TAPE2 DD's are used, the dsname
                         from TAPE2 will be used on both output tapes
                      2) If the MASTER is a multi-file tape or a single
                         file tape, the SLPARMS file described
                         in the 'SL' parm below will be used for the
                         dataset names. For the RENAME parm, only the
                         first 17 characters of each SLPARMS record
                         are required.

               SL - Indicates creation of a standard labelled
                    output tape. All DCB parameters must be specified
                    through the SLPARMS file. The SLPARMS records
                    must be coded as follows :

                     1-17 = The last 17 characters of the dataset name
                       18 = blank
                    19-22 = File sequence number -eg- 0001
                       23 = blank
                    24-25 = Recfm -eg- FB (FR for FBS)
                       26 = blank
                    27-31 = Block size -eg- 04000
                       32 = blank
                    33-37 = Record length -eg- 00080
                       38 = blank
                    38-80 = blank

                    There must be 1 SLPARMS record for each file
                    to be copied. If there is not, the TAPECOPY
                    job will be terminated.

           PRINT= - Indicates the number of records to be printed
                    from each file. PRINT=ALL will cause all
                    records of each file to be printed.
                    A maximum of 4 characters can be specified.

                  NOTE ...
                    If the records are longer than 132 characters,
                    they will be printed in 132 byte chunks.


              HEX - Causes records printed to be printed in a
                    hex dump format.
                  - If there is a //HEXPRINT DD SYSOUT=A dd statement
                    in the job stream, the hex listing will be printed
                    there rather than on SYSPRINT with the DEBE
                    information.
