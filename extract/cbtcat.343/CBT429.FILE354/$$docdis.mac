  January 1999. This version of DISASM has been modified by:

  DISASM was heavily modified to produce a more useable and readable
  assembler listing type of output. If a source deck is produced, it
  can, in most cases, be passed through the assembler compiler to
  produce a valid load module. This is a very usefull feature if the
  original source for a load module has been lost, and modifications
  are to be made to the module.
  All (hopefully) changes have RH in columns 69-70.

  MEMBER    Description or purpose
  ========  ============================================================
  $ASM      Jcl to assemble DISASM in one job. To run this jcl,
            the jcl around members DISASM, DISASM1, and DISASM2
            must be removed.
            Dataset names must be changed.

  $REQU     Macro for register equates. This is not used in this
            version of DISASM.

  CBTJCL    Jcl to ??

  CLIST     Sample clist to run DISASM under TSO. I have not tested
            this...

  CLIST2    Sample clist to run DISASM under TSO TEST.
            Dataset names must be changed.

  DISALINK  Jcl to link object modules DISASM, DISASM1, and DISASM2
            to produce load module DISASM.
            Dataset names must be changed.
            This jcl assumes you have an object module library.

  DISASM    The is part 1 of the DISASM program.
            Dataset names must be changed.
            This job creates an object module in SYSLIN.
            This jcl assumes you have an object module library.
            Dataset names must be changed.

  DISASM1   The is part 2 of the DISASM program.
            Dataset names must be changed.
            This job creates an object module in SYSLIN.
            This jcl assumes you have an object module library.
            Dataset names must be changed.

  DISASM2   The is part 3 of the DISASM program.
            Dataset names must be changed.
            This job creates an object module in SYSLIN.
            This jcl assumes you have an object module library.
            Dataset names must be changed.

  DISASM3A  Copy member used by DISASM, DISASM1, and DISASM2.
            This member defines valid instruction op codes, etc.

  DISASM3B  Copy member used by DISASM, DISASM1, and DISASM2.
            This member defines valid SVC op codes, etc.

  DISASPRM  Copy member used by DISASM, DISASM1, and DISASM2.
            This member contains DSECTS used by DISASM.
            They are: COMMPARM, LABELD, USINGD, DSECTD, RLDTBLD,
                      and SYMTBL. I have changed COMMPARM.

  HOWDISAS  DISASM documentation and jcl to print it.

  OLDDOC    Old DISASM documentation.

  REQU      Macro to generate register equates. I don't use this.

  RUNDIS    Jcl to run DISASM.
            Dataset names must be changed.

  SVLNK     Macro to generate program entry code.

  SYSIN     SYSIN control statements used by CLIST2.

  This PDS is set up to run members DISASM, DISASM1, and DISASM2 to
  create object modules which are then linked together in DISALINK
  to create the DISASM load module.
