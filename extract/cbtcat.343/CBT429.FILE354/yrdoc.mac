  2.0  PREFACE
  ____________

        This publication,   the YR2000 Reference Manual,    3rd
        edition, November, 1996 describes how to use the YR2000
        utility program.


  3.0  INTRODUCTION
  _________________


  The program YR2000 is used to help determine if a program MAY be
  accessing the system TIME/DATE facility, or if it calls a specific
  module/program.

  YR2000 is written using standard IBM code, and should run on any
  IBM mainframe running MVS software in 24 bit mode.

  YR2000 should be 100% accurate for the TIME/DATE macro, but is not
  100% accurate for the STCK/STCKC instruction(s) because the code
  generated for the STCK/STCKC instruction(s) MAY be part of another
  instruction, or part of a hexadecimal field, such as a counter.
  For version 3, additional code has been added to trap the STCK/STCKC ×
  code to ensure that it is not part of another instruction.           ×
  It should now be much more accurate.                                 ×

  BUT at least you are made aware that the named program COULD be
  accessing the system TIME/DATE facility, or if it calls a specific
  module/program.


  4.0  PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
  ________________________

  YR2000 reads a dataset name from //INLIB to determine what programs
  to check for access to the TIME/DATE facility, or the specified
  module/program.

  The dataset is read to get a list of the member names.
  If the member name is an ALIAS, it is not used.

  Each member is read to get the link-edit date.

  Each member is then loaded and is scanned for the presence of the
  TIME macro (SVC 11) which also gives you the DATE, the STCK
  instruction, or the STCKC instruction.  If a PARM= is specified on
  the EXEC PGM=YR2000 statement, each member is also scanned for the
  program name specified.
  A count is kept of how many times the variable is found.

  Up to 40 program names, or other hex data, can be specified in
  the //SYSIN dd statement.
  The names start in column 1 and can be a maximum of 8 characters.
  Hexadecimal data is entered as X'aabbcc'. The data can be a max of
  8 characters, which is 4 hex bytes.
  The number of characters must be a multiple of 2.



  5.0  PROGRAM PARAMETERS
  _______________________

  Using the PARM= jcl parameter, YR2000 can be passed the name of a
  TIME/DATE routine that could be called by the programs in the //INLIB
  dataset.
  If PARM=DEBUG  is specified, all member names will be shown.
  If PARM=OFFSET is specified, an extra line is printed showing the
                 offset into the module of any code/name found.

  6.0  JCL
  ________


  The following JCL is required to run YR2000:
  //*
  //YR2000 EXEC PGM=YR2000,REGION=4000K   ,PARM=name
  //STEPLIB  DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SYSPP.Y2K.PROD.LOADLIB
  //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*               for the membername list
  //SYSABEND DD SYSOUT=*               for a dump, if needed
  //INLIB    DD DSN=load.module.library,
  //            DISP=SHR
  //SYSIN    DD *
  MOD2                      check for MOD2
  MOD3                      check for MOD3
  X'0A10'                   also find SVC 16...purge...
  /*
  //

  Note...the PARM= and //SYSIN dd statement and data are optional.

  6.1  JCL COMMENTS
  _________________


  The STEPLIB  DD statement is not required if the YR2000 program is
                  in a system linklist library.

  The SYSPRINT DD statement will contain a list of members that may be
                  accessing the system TIME/DATE facility.

  The INLIB    DD statement tells YR2000 which dataset to scan.

  The SYSIN    DD statement is for additional modules/hex data.

  If the PARM= is included, the "name" specified is the name of a
  routine that is called by other programs.
  This program could be called to get the TIME/DATE.

  Note... the PARM= or //SYSIN could be used to find ANY module name
          called by the programs in //INLIB.

  7.0  YR2000 RETURN CODES
  ________________________


  The following return codes and abends can occur:

        16 - An invalid PARM was found...the length is over 8.
           - The dataset specified in //INLIB is empty.
           - The hex data in //SYSIN is invalid.


  8.0  YR2000 MESSAGES
  ____________________


  The messages produced by YR2000 are self-explanatory.
  The messages and their meanings are:

  BADPARM*   PARM TOO LONG.
           - The parameter passed in the PARM= is over 8 bytes long.

  NOMBRS**  //INLIB IS EMPTY.
           - The dataset specified in //INLIB is empty.

  X'hexdata'                 HEX DATA MUST BE A MULTIPLE OF 2
           - The length of hex data in //SYSIN must be a multiple of
             2 characters.

  X'hexdata'                 HEX DATA MUST BE LESS THAN 9 BYTES LONG
           - The maximum length of hex data in //SYSIN is 8.


  mbrname       ERROR DOING FIND FOR MEMBER.
           - Indicates that the FIND macro had a problem locating
             the specified "mbrname".
           - Execution of YR2000 continues.

  mbrname date  ERROR DOING LOAD FOR MEMBER..PROBABLY NOT EXECUTABLE
           - Indicates that the specified "mbrname" could not be
             loaded and scanned. The module is probably a bad load
             module that could not be executed.
           - Execution of YR2000 continues.
