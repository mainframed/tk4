$$$$$DOC is the "master doc" for this file. This file contains
several different programs that are further documented in individual
$$DOC... members if the installation is more complicated than just
running the job.

If there is no $$DOC... member, the program should hopefully be
self-contained and self-explanatory.

JCL in all jobs will have to be modified for your dataset names
and your procedure names.

Also note that I'm one of those programmers who doesn't delete code...
I just comment it out, so some source may have a lot of commented
code!

A lot of the programs in this file do not specifically have a
copyright notice imbedded in them, so this notice applies to
ALL my source....

   YOU MUST LEAVE IT AS IS, AND CANNOT SELL IT TO ANYONE,

If you do make changes, I would appreciate it if you sent me a copy
so that I can keep my source up-to-date. Thanks...
