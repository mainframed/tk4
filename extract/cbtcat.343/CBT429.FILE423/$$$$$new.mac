                  A SHORT NOTE FROM SAM GOLOB

I needed Jeff Broido's LAA command to work with SWA "above the line",
so I asked Jeff to fix it.  Jeff obliged.  Jeff thinks that a bunch
of his other commands also won't work with SWA above the line, but
he doesn't have a chance right now to fix this entire file.  I didn't
want to deprive all of you from at least using LAA, and seeing how
Jeff fixed it.  Therefore, I'm replacing LAA with the fixed version.
The rest of File 423 is unchanged.
