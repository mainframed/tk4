LIBCLEAN is a REXX ISPF dialog that compares the directories of two
PDS' and display a list of matching or non-matching member names and
statistics. Statistics are provided for ISPF members and load modules.
(load module stats require that FINDMEM CP be available).

Operations such as browse, compare, or delete may then
be performed against members in the list. All listed members may
be mass deleted from either the OLD or NEW library. Selected members
may be excluded from the mass delete.

This tool can be useful for deleting duplicate copies of software when
the product is in a mixed library. It is a very fast way to clean up
messy ISPF files.  It can also be used to verify source members exist
for a load library.

Make yourself a copy of some libraries you may want to work with
and give it a try.

Installing LIBCLEAN
------------------
- Copy member LIBCLEAN to your SYSPROC or SYSEXEC library.
- Copy members LIB@* to your ISPPLIB library.
- Assemble the FINDMEM.BAL file to TSO STEPLIB, ISPLLIB or LNKLST lib.
   This is only required if you want stats for load modules.

Invoking LIBCLEAN
------------------
Enter TSO %LIBCLEAN

Enter library names as directed on the initial panel. LIBCLEAN will
then build the matched or unmatched list.

Sorry...no help screens yet.

Line commands
-------------
Any unrecognized line command, e.g. '?' will display a list of
valid line commands.

The following line commands are provided:

- BO / BN - Browse member from the OLD lib (BO) or the NEW lib (BN).

- C - Invoke IBM SuperCompare with the members from NEW and OLD libs.

- DO / DN - Delete member from the OLD lib (DO) or the NEW lib (DN).

- S - Show Load module stats for the member. Requires the FINDMEM CP.

- X - EXclude the member from the list. Use this to exclude members
      from the mass DELETE primary command.

Primary commands
----------------
The following primary commands are provided:

  - DELETE OLD
  - DELETE NEW   Delete all members on list from OLD or NEW lib. This
                 will be followed by a delete confirmation panel.

  - Locate xxx   Position the list to member xxx.

Feedback
--------

Please let me know if you have problems making this work.
If you make any improvements, I would like a copy. I'm
especially interested in help screens.
