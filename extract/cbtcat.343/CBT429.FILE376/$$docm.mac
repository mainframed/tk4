 ZDF and most add-ons work for up to OS 390 v 2.6.
 Callable interfaces are used where possible so it does not matter
 what the MVS version is.
 ZDF was updated from XDF as distributed on CBT many years ago.

 There is a lot of stuff in add-ons already on CBT but those here
 are maybe mofified by me.
  - as well as ZDF, UDF (display devices)
  and EDJES3 (ISPF JES3 console with nice help)
             are worth a good look.

 (The add-ons are called from the top line of the zdf panel display
  - they can be called as TSO commands but some rely on panels
    in the PDS which is ispplib libdefed when ZDF called.
    You can fix that by copying the panels to a d/s in ispplib defn.)

  ZDF displays :
  _____________

  . cpu utilisation as seen by srm
  . avail frame count
  . total paging rate
  . uic
  . memory estimate
  . tso period details (if source adjusted to skip correct # of
                        performance groups in ips - see line
    LA    R5,13           ** PERFORM GROUP SKIP **          )
  . speed constant
  . # of cpus and lpar #
  . total cpu calculated as sum of all ascbs cpu/elapse time - thus
    max 300% say for 3 cpus if all cpu available to an lpar.
  . ASCB details (job name, # excps, memory status, pg,
    dispatching priority, %cpu and cpu).

 To install this useful tool :
 ______________________________

 In ZDF (member ZDFESA) :-

 . For MVS 4.2 and below edit to comment out that which fails assembly.

 . Ensure this pds is named hlq.slq  and no third hlq is used and
   keep hlq to 5 chars and slq to 3 chars for easy install.
   Change xsdmn to 5 char hlq of this pds as restored.
   Change zdf to your slq.
   i.e. replace xdmn.zdf by your pds name.
   (else additional editing of jobs -
     choosing longer pds names requires knowledge of assembler
     to use up empty space at end of constant declaration).

 . This pds serves as a panel library for program ZDF.
   It should also serve as a dynamic clist/rexx sysproc,
   but I think you may have to copy clists to sysproc as in TSO logon
   JCL etc.

 . apf auth not required.

 . install so that load library that ZDF is in (& any add-on pgms)
   is in linklist, steplib, or ispllib for ISPF session.

 . Allocate dd(sysprint) da(*) to your tso session for some of the
   'add-on' program displays.

============================================================

 How to use ZDF :
 ________________

Call via TSO ZDF - initial result is that a panel listing all batch
                   jobs that are running will be displayed.

 From this panel :

 . display only batch, tso, stcs, or all.
 . prefix option may be used to restrict list of ascbs displayed
 . optn 0 = list only ascbs which clock cpu between enter pressed.
        q = list job classes if flasher in-use and flasher jct
            specified correctly in source.
        s = sort the display by invoking a clist.
        j = show job numbers rather than asid # (takes time).
   rptsec = non-zero will cause automatic update every rptsec secs.

 line options against a given line in the display.
      s = give tso status info.
      c = cancel via tso cancel.
      n = show enqueues of address space (comp & link QN)
      f = use Flasher (if avail) to show jobs spool output

 _______________________________________________________________

 Options selected off the cua panel line sometimes call other
 programs which will need to be compiled into your load lib.

 Options window may be used to customise the ZDF display.
 However there is nothing in the options window that cannot be done by
 changing options on the 4 th line.

 The tape option selects program EDTAPE which is a cut-down version
 of UDF to display tape & cartridge drive status (see EDTAPASM source).

 TSO1 window is used to select :
 1) Show all Adabas jobs. Clist using TSODZN program.  See TSODSN
    elsewhere on CBT to list users of a given dataset. TSODZN is a
    program not a command processor program.
 2) List IPL details     - see program LASTIPL.
 3) List enqueue details - see program TSOENQ.
 4) List IO this session - see program IOXA.
 5) SMF status           - see C4SMFDS (RDSNAME length 44 in OS/390)
 6) HSM users            - do without this - source YDF may not work.
 7) IO by processor      - see program IOMVS
 8) Unit display         - see program UDF - definitely worth having.
 9) Amdahl MDF           - clist MDF reads SMF lpar data from type 70
                           live SMF (using SAS clist).
    You really don't need Amdahl MDF, IBM lpar OK too - but do need SAS.
 10) Chpid display       - see program EDCHP.
 11) APF List            - see program APFLIST.
 12) CSA data            - see program CSA.
 13) List catalogs       - see program CATDISP.
 14) Look at memory      - see program LOOK from elsewhere on CBT.
                           (source here, but missing link include -
                            you can use this if you tinker to do w/o it)
 15) Dataset enqueues    - see program TSODSN
 16) Dataset enqueues    - see program TSODSNG for multiple dataset
                           enqueues from hlq specification.
 17) SRM domains         - see program DDMN.
 18) Link list dfisplay  - see program LLA.

 TSO2 window is used to select :
 Any one of the SCR, STG, or LSPACE programs which are all pretty
 similar but list respectively scratch, storage, or all online volumes.

 JES3 option is used to select program EDJES3.
 If you have JES3 you can update the inish deck & vtamlst &
 IATUX31 (I think) auth exit & then do JES3 displays (or more)
 from ISPF.  The help panel in this may be customised to convert
 English statements to JES3 commands,

 Ignore the SP option.
