  This is a rewrite of the dissassembler package on files U08010,
U08013 and U08014 of the UK Guide tape. It reads an object deck as
input. Drivers to delink load modules and disassemble them are also
provided.

You need either DELINK0, which is provided in this file, or DELINKI off
CBT file 90 to delink load modules. See CBT file 316 for a dissassembly
of DELINK0 with full instructions.

The test jobs need COMPARE  off CBT file 149 to compare LMODS or an
equivalent product.

  Send comments, bug reports, etc to CHRIS.KENDON@PGEN.COM. I would
be grateful to anyone who can send any instructions or design spec
for the original version, I haven't yet worked out what the parameter
cards you can feed into it are supposed to do.
