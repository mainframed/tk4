       The following bugs and limitations are being worked on.

If dissassembling an object deck from the assembler where the module
ended with a DS then the trailing DS is left off the output. This makes
the module shorter than it should be.

The equates at the end of the source are not generated correctly if the
first equate is before any label generated in the output. They should
be generated near to the place they refer to as well.

DISAS does not support an object deck containing more than one CSECT.

Q type address constants and DXD/CXD's are not supported.

The tables to hold text, externs, RLD info etc are fixed size. If they
fill up the dissassembly fails. They should be dynamically sized.

The timing info is for a system 360 and thus useless. It should be
replaced with something more useful.

Immediate and relative instructions are not supported.

Registers should be equated to R0, R1, etc instead of appearing as
numbers.

Extended Mnemonics should be generated for branch instructions

Vector instructions are not supported.
