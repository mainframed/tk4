)F FUNCTION -
  THE BLDINDEX COMMAND IS USED TO BUILD ONE OR MORE VSAM ALTERNATE
  INDEXES OVER A VSAM BASE CLUSTER.  BOTH THE BASE CLUSTER AND
  ALTERNATE INDEX MUST HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY DEFINED.  THE BASE
  CLUSTER MUST NOT BE EMPTY AND THE ALTERNATE INDEX MUST EITHER
  BE EMPTY OR HAVE BEEN DEFINED WITH THE REUSABLE ATTRIBUTE.
  THE BASE CLUSTER MAY EITHER BE A KEY-SEQUENCED DATA SET OR AN
  ENTRY-SEQUENCED DATA SET.

)O OPERANDS -
))INFILE('DNAME/PASSWORD')
           - IDENTIFIES THE BASE CLUSTER VIA DDNAME
  'DNAME'  - NAMES THE DD STATEMENT THAT IDENTIFIES THE BASE
             CLUSTER OR A PATH THAT POINTS TO THE BASE CLUSTER.
  'PASSWORD'
           - READ (OR HIGHER LEVEL) PASSWORD OF THE OBJECT IDENTIFIED
             VIA 'DNAME'; I.E., THE BASE CLUSTER OR PATH OVER THE
             BASE CLUSTER.
  REQUIRED - 'DNAME'
))INDATASET('ENTRYNAME/PASSWORD')
           - IDENTIFIES THE BASE CLUSTER VIA DSNAME
  'ENTRYNAME'
           - NAMES THE BASE CLUSTER OR A PATH THAT POINTS TO
             THE BASE CLUSTER.  WHEN YOU SPECIFY INDATASET, THE BASE
             CLUSTER'S VOLUME IS DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATED.
  'PASSWORD'
           - READ (OR HIGHER LEVEL) PASSWORD OF THE OBJECT IDENTIFIED
             VIA 'ENTRYNAME'; I.E., THE BASE CLUSTER OR PATH OVER THE
             BASE CLUSTER.
  REQUIRED - 'ENTRYNAME'
))OUTFILE('DNAME/PASSWORD' ...)
           - IDENTIFIES THE ALTERNATE INDEX VIA DDNAME
  'DNAME'  - NAMES THE DD STATEMENT THAT IDENTIFIES THE ALTERNATE
             INDEX OR A PATH THAT POINTS TO THE ALTERNATE INDEX.
  'PASSWORD'
           - UPDATE (OR HIGHER LEVEL) PASSWORD OF THE OBJECT
             IDENTIFIED VIA 'DNAME'; I.E., THE ALTERNATE INDEX
             OR A PATH OVER THE ALTERNATE INDEX.
  REQUIRED - 'DNAME'
))OUTDATASET('ENTRYNAME/PASSWORD' ...)
           - IDENTIFIES THE ALTERNATE INDEX VIA DSNAME
  'ENTRYNAME'
           - NAMES THE ALTERNATE INDEX OR A PATH THAT POINTS TO
             THE ALTERNATE INDEX.  WHEN YOU SPECIFY OUTDATASET,
             THE ALTERNATE INDEX'S VOLUME IS DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATED.
  'PASSWORD'
           - UPDATE (OR HIGHER LEVEL) PASSWORD OF THE OBJECT
             IDENTIFIED VIA 'ENTRYNAME'; I.E., THE ALTERNATE
             INDEX OR A PATH OVER THE ALTERNATE INDEX.
  REQUIRED - 'ENTRYNAME'
))INTERNALSORT
           - SPECIFIES THAT THE KEY-POINTER PAIRS CREATED BY
             BLDINDEX ARE TO BE SORTED ENTIRELY WITHIN USER-
             PROVIDED VIRTUAL STORAGE IF ENOUGH IS AVAILABLE.
             IF THE REQUIRED AMOUNT OF VIRTUAL STORAGE IS NOT
             AVAILABLE, BLDINDEX WILL ATTEMPT TO PERFORM AN
             EXTERNAL SORT.
))EXTERNALSORT
           - SPECIFIES THAT THE KEY-POINTER PAIRS CREATED BY
             BLDINDEX ARE TO BE SORTED USING TWO EXTERNAL
             SORT WORKFILES THAT ARE DYNAMICALLY DEFINED AS
             TWO VSAM ENTRY-SEQUENCED DATA SETS.  IF AN
             EXTERNAL SORT IS TO BE PERFORMED, TWO DD STATEMENTS
             THAT DESCRIBE THE EXTERNAL SORT WORKFILES MUST
             BE PROVIDED.
))WORKFILES('DNAME' 'DNAME')
           - NAMES THE DD STATEMENTS THAT IDENTIFY THE WORKFILES
             TO BE USED BY BLDINDEX IF AN EXTERNAL SORT OF THE
             KEY-POINTER PAIRS IS REQUIRED.  IF THE DD STATEMENTS
             ARE IDENTIFIED WITH THE STANDARD DNAMES OF IDCUT1
             AND IDCUT2, THE WORKFILES PARAMETER IS NOT REQUIRED.
             REQUIRED PARAMETERS ON THE DD STATEMENTS ARE:  DATA SET
             NAME, VOLUME CONTAINING VSAM DATA SPACE, UNIT, DISP=OLD,
             AND AMP='AMORG'.
))CATALOG('CATNAME/PASSWORD')
           - SPECIFIES THE NAME OF THE CATALOG IN WHICH THE TWO SORT
             WORKFILES ARE TO BE DEFINED AS VSAM ENTRY-SEQUENCED
             DATA SETS IN THE EVENT AN EXTERNAL SORT IS PERFORMED
             BY BLDINDEX.
  'CATNAME'
           - NAME OF THE CATALOG IN WHICH THE TWO SORT WORKFILES
             ARE TO BE DEFINED.
  'PASSWORD'
           - MASTER LEVEL PASSWORD OF THE CATALOG.
  REQUIRED - REQUIRED IF AN EXTERNAL SORT IS TO BE PERFORMED AND THE
             DEFINE OF THE SORT WORKFILES IS TO BE DIRECTED TO A
             SPECIFIC CATALOG AND/OR THE CATALOG TO BE USED
             IS PASSWORD PROTECTED.
