)F FUNCTION -
  THE TERMINAL COMMAND IS USED TO DEFINE THE PHYSICAL TERMINAL
  CHARACTERSTICS TO THE TSO SYSTEM. THESE CHARACTERISTICS APPLY TO
  THE TERMINAL CURRENTLY IN USE AND ARE VALID FOR ONLY ONE SESSION
  OR UNTIL THE TERMINAL COMMAND IS REISSUED DURING THE SESSION.

  NOTE     - IF THE TERMINAL COMMAND IS ENTERED WITH NO OPERANDS, THE
             COMMAND IS IGNORED.
  NOTE     - SOME OF THE TERMINAL COMMAND KEYWORDS ARE NOT SUPPORTED
             ON ALL TERMINAL TYPES.
)O OPERANDS-
))LINES('INTEGER')
           - SPECIFIES THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF CONTINUOUS OUTPUT WHICH
             IS TO OCCUR BETWEEN PROMPTS FOR A SIMULATED ATTENTION.
    'INTEGER'
           - MUST BE A VALUE FROM 1-255.
))NOLINES  - SPECIFIES THAT PROMPTING FOR SIMULATED ATTENTIONS TO
             INTERRUPT OUTPUT WILL BE TERMINATED.
))SECONDS('INTEGER')
           - SPECIFIES THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF 'LOCKED KEYBOARD' TIME
             (ALL NUMBERS ARE ROUNDED TO THE NEAREST TEN SECONDS)
             WHICH IS TO OCCUR BETWEEN PROMPTS FOR SIMULATED
             ATTENTIONS.
    'INTEGER'
           - MUST BE A VALUE FROM 10 TO 2550.
))NOSECONDS- SPECIFIES THAT THE USER IS NOT TO BE PROMPTED FOR
             SIMULATED ATTENTIONS WHEN HIS KEYBOARD WOULD
             ORDINARILY BE LOCKED AND HIS TERMINAL INACTIVE.
))INPUT('CHARACTER STRING')
           - SPECIFIES A CHARACTER STRING WHICH IS TO BE RECOGNIZED
             DURING INPUT OPERATIONS AS AN ATTENTION.
    'CHARACTER STRING'
           - IS ANY COMBINATION OF 4 OR LESS VALID CHARACTERS.
))NOINPUT  - SPECIFIES THAT NO CHARACTER STRING WILL BE USED FOR
             ATTENTION ON INPUT.
))LINESIZE('INTEGER')
           - SPECIFIES THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF CHARACTERS THAT ARE TO
             BE PRINTED ON A LINE AT A KEYBOARD TYPE TERMINAL.
    'INTEGER'
           - IS A VALUE FROM 1 TO 255.
))SCRSIZE('N','M')
           - SPECIFIES THE DIMENSION OF THE DISPLAY STATION.
    'N'    - SPECIFIES THE NUMBER OF ROWS ON THE SCREEN.
    'M'    - SPECIFIES THE LENGTH OF EACH ROW.
))BREAK    - SPECIFIES THAT THE TERMINAL HAS THE REVERSE BREAK FEATURE.
))NOBREAK  - SPECIFIES THAT THE TERMINAL DOES NOT HAVE THE REVERSE
             BREAK FEATURE.
))TIMEOUT  - SPECIFIES THAT THE TERMINAL DOES NOT HAVE THE TIMEOUT
             SUPPRESSION FEATURE: WHEN IN TRANSMIT MODE, THE KEYBOARD
             WILL LOCK IF THE USER DOES NOT STRIKE A KEY WITHIN
             APPROXIMATELY 9-18 SECONDS. OF THE TERMINALS SUPPORTED
             FOR FIRST RELEASE, THIS OPERAND IS APPLICABLE ONLY TO
             1050 AND NEED BE USED ONLY IF THE INSTALLATION HAS
             DEFINED THE TERMINAL OR THE LINE ON WHICH IT MAY CALL
             THE CPU AS HAVING THE TEXT TIMEOUT SUPPRESSION FEATURE.
))NOTIMEOUT- SPECIFIES THAT THE TERMINAL DOES HAVE THE TIMEOUT
             SUPPRESSION FEATURE.
))CLEAR('CHARACTER STRING')
           - SPECIFIES A CHARACTER STRING TO BE USED TO CLEAR THE
             SCREEN OF THE DISPLAY STATION.
    'CHARACTER STRING'
           - IS A COMBINATION OF 4 OR LESS VALID CHARACTERS.
))NOCLEAR  - SPECIFIES THAT A CHARACTER STRING WILL NOT BE USED
             TO ERASE THE SCREEN OF A DISPLAY STATION.
))TRAN('NAME')
           - CHARACTER CODE TRANSLATION IS IN EFFECT USING THE
             TABLES CONTAINED IN THE LOAD MODULE SPECIFIED.
    'NAME' - THE LOAD MODULE NAME THAT CONTAINS THE TRANSLATE TABLE.
))NOTRAN   - SPECIFIES THAT NO CHARACTER TRANSLATION IS TO TAKE PLACE.
))CHAR((X'HEXCHAR',C'CHAR'),(C'CHAR',X'HEXCHAR'),...)
           - SPECIFIES ONE OR MORE PAIRS OF CHARACTERS, IN EITHER
             HEXADECIMAL OR CHARACTER NOTATION, THAT REPLACE
             CHARACTERS IN THE TRANSLATE TABLE.
    '(X'HEXCHAR',C'CHAR'),(C'CHAR',X'HEXCHAR'),...'
           - THE FIRST CHARACTER OF THE PAIR IS THE CURRENT
             CHARACTER THAT IS DEFINED. THE SECOND CHARACTER
             IS THE NEW CHARACTER THAT IS TO REPLACE THE
             FIRST ONE.
             EITHER THE FIRST OR THE SECOND CHARACTER MAY BE
             EXPRESSED IN HEXADECIMAL OR CHARACTER NOTATION.
))NOCHAR   - SPECIFIES THAT ALL CHARACTER TRANSLATIONS PREVIOUSLY
             SPECIFIED ARE NO LONGER IN EFFECT.
