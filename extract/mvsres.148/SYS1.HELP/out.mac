           - DIRECTS SYSOUT TO THE DATASET SPECIFIED.
    '*'    - AN ASTERISK INDICATES THAT THE SYSOUT IS TO BE DIRECTED
             TO THE USER'S TERMINAL.
    'DSNAME'
           - IF THE DATASET SPECIFIED IS OLD, ITS CONTENTS WILL BE
             REPLACED.  IF THE DATASET IS OLD AND PARTITIONED, A

             EXIST, A NEW DATASET WILL BE ALLOCATED.

             LAST POINT OF INTERRUPTION (APPROXIMATELY TEN LINES BACK).
))NEXT     - INDICATES OUTPUT IS TO BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE
             NEXT DATASET WHICH HAS NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY CHECKPOINTED.
))PAUSE    - INDICATES OUTPUT IS TO PAUSE AFTER PROCESSING EACH
             DATASET TO ALLOW THE USER TO ENTER A SAVE, CONTINUE,
             HELP, OR END SUCBCOMMAND.  A NULL LINE ENTERED AT A
             PAUSE WILL CAUSE PROCESSING TO CONTINUE.
))NOPAUSE  - INDICATES PROCESSING IS TO BE UNINTERRUPTED (UNLESS USER
             HITS ATTENTION).
))KEEP     - INDICATES THAT THE SYSOUT IS TO BE RETAINED BY THE
             SYSTEM AFTER IT HAS BEEN PRINTED AT THE TERMINAL.
))NOKEEP   - INDICATES THAT THE SYSOUT IS TO BE DELETED AFTER
             PRINTING AT THE TERMINAL.
))HOLD     - INDICATES THAT THE SYSOUT IS TO REMAIN AVAILABLE TO

             DATASET IF PAUSE OCCURRED.
))NEXT     - INDICATES INTERRUPTED OUTPUT IS TO BE RESUMED WITH THE
