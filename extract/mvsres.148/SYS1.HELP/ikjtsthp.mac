)F FUNCTION -
  THE TEST COMMAND IS USED TO DEBUG AND VERIFY THE PROPER EXECUTION OF
  A PROGRAM.  THE TEST COMMAND IS MOST READILY USED TO TEST PROGRAMS
  WRITTEN IN BASIC ASSEMBLER LANGUAGE.  A KNOWLEDGE OF THE BASIC
  ASSEMBLER LANGUAGE IS REQUIRED TO USE THE TEST COMMAND.
  THE TEST COMMAND ALLOWS YOU TO TEST PROGRAMS IN THE FOLLOWING FORMS-
  - PROGRAMS CURRENTLY EXECUTING WITHIN THE SYSTEM.
  - PROGRAMS WHICH HAVE ABNORMALLY TERMINATED (ABEND) AND ARE STILL IN
  MAIN STORAGE.
  - PROGRAMS IN OBJECT OR LOAD MODULE FORMS WHICH MUST BE LOADED FROM
  SEQUENTIAL OR PARTITIONED DATASETS.
  THE TEST COMMAND ALLOWS YOU TO TEST PROGRAMS BY ENABLING YOU TO-
  - SUPPLY INITIAL VALUES (TEST DATA) TO THE PROGRAM UNDER TEST.
  - ESTABLISH BREAKPOINTS WITHIN A PROGRAM WHERE EXECUTION WILL BE
  INTERRUPTED FOR YOU TO EXAMINE INTERIM RESULTS.
  - DISPLAY REGISTER AND MAIN STORAGE CONTENTS AT SUCH A BREAKPOINT.
  - MODIFY REGISTER AND MAIN STORAGE CONTENTS.
  - DISPLAY THE PROGRAM STATUS WORD (PSW).
  - LIST THE CONTENTS OF CONTROL BLOCKS, THESE ARE DEB, DCB AND TCB.
  - STEP THROUGH A SECTION OF THE PROGRAM EXECUTING ONE INSTRUCTION AT
  A TIME.
  THE TEST COMMAND ALLOWS YOU TO USE ABSOLUTE AND REGISTER ADDRESSING
  AS WELL AS ADDRESSING RELATIVE TO THE FIRST BYTE OF THE PROGRAM.
  SYMBOLIC ADDRESSING CAN BE USED IN THE FOLLOWING INSTANCES-
  - IF THE PROGRAM WAS BOTH ASSEMBLED AND LINK EDITED USING THE 'TEST'
  OPTION, THE SYMBOLS IN THE ASSEMBLY CAN BE USED UNDER THE TEST
  COMMAND.  EXCEPTIONS INCLUDE SYMBOLS ON EQU, LTORG, AND ORG
  STATEMENTS.
  - IF THE PROGRAM WAS ONLY LINK EDITED WITH THE 'TEST' OPTION, ONLY
  SYMBOLS IN THE EXTERNAL SYMBOL DICTIONARY CAN BE USED UNDER TEST
  - ANY SYMBOL DEFINED BY THE USE OF THE EQUATE SUBCOMMAND CAN BE USED.
