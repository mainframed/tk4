   PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:
     NO RECORD IS KEPT OF THE CPU TIME USED WHEN TIME=1440 IS USED.
       SPECIFYING TIME=1440 ON THE JOB OR EXEC JCL STATEMENT IS
       A METHOD OF INDICATING TO THE SYSTEM THAT THERE IS NO LIMIT
       TO BE APPLIED BY THE SYSTEM TO THE STEP'S ACCUMULATION OF
       CPU TIME OR WAIT TIME.  THIS FACILITY WAS CONCEPTUALLY
       EXTENDED TO MEAN THAT SUCH JOBS WERE NOT TO BE SUBJECT TO
       CHARGEBACK, AND SO CPU TIME USED BY SUCH JOBS WAS "FREE".
       AS A RESULT, THE CPU TIME USED BY JOB STEPS WHEN TIME=1440
       IN EFFECT IS NOT RECORDED, AND ZERO TIME IS REPORTED IN THE
       STEP (IEF374I) AND JOB (IEF376I) END MESSAGES, AND IN SMF
       (RECORD TYPES 4, 5, 34 AND 35) THUS EFFECTIVELY FAILING TO
       CAPTURE SIGNIFICANT JOB AND SYSTEM PERFORMANCE DATA.

       THIS USERMOD UPDATES THE INITIATOR ATTACH ROUTINE TO MOVE
       THE TEST TO SEE IF JOB/STEP TIMING LIMITS ARE IN EFFECT
       UNTIL AFTER THE TCB AND SRB CPU TIMES USED BY THE STEP HAVE
       BEEN SAVED.

   SPECIAL CONDITIONS:
     ACTION:
       A "CLPA" MUST BE PERFORMED AT IPL TIME FOR THIS SYSMOD TO
       BECOME ACTIVE.
