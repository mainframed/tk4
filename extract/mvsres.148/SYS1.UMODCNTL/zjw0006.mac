//* Name: SYS1.UMODCNTL(ZJW0006)
//*
//* Desc: Install usermod ZJW0006
//*
//*     Update IEECVXIT WTO message automation exit:
//*
//*     o SNA LU1/2 terminals provided by the Hercules 3705 and 3791
//*       emulations shoud be varied inactive and then back active
//*       between consecutive logons for several reasons (reliabilty,
//*       usability with not SSCP-LU session capable TN3270 applica-
//*       tions through SIMLOGON to name the most important ones).
//*
//*       Usermod ZJW0005 provides WTO message LGN001I identifying
//*       terminals when a TSO logon is in progress. Usermod ZJW0006
//*       adds V NET,INACT - V NET,ACT processing to the autopilot
//*       triggered by message LGN001I against terminals with LUnames
//*       beginning with T327A and T376A. Once one of this terminals
//*       has become inactive due to a V NET,INACT command a V NET,ACT
//*       command is issued after a delay. That delay is
//*
//*        - 1 second if the 6th character of the LUname is an 'S'
//*        - 10 seconds in all other cases
//*
//*     o Remote 3705 NCPs impersonated by the Hercules 3705 emulation
//*       appear to VTAM always as loaded. These NCPs (as well as the
//*       impersonated local ones) cannot be IPLed and consequently
//*       the IFLOADRN replacement just returns "success" to the caller
//*       but doesn't perform any real IPL operation on the emulated
//*       3705s. This leads to message
//*
//*       IST183A  ncpname  FOUND LOADED WITH ncpname  - REPLY YES/NO
//*                TO RE-IPL
//*
//*       being issued upon every activation of such an NCP. It is
//*       completely irrelevant if this message is answered with YES
//*       or NO, because an IPL will never take place anyway.
//*
//*       Thus ZJW0006 has the autopilot always answer this message
//*       with YES.
