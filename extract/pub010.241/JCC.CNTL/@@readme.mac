JCC.CNTL
========

This PDS contains the JCL that comes with JCC, adapted and augmented to
be ready to use on TK4- MVS 3.8j systems. Using this JCL provides finer
control over the JCC tool chain than just using the JCCC, JCCCL, JCCCLG
and JCCCG cataloged procedures. The use of the cataloged procedures,
however, is much more straightforward and should be adequate for most
use cases.

See the individual members' comment headers and the JCC HTML help as
found in TK4-.JASON.JCC.ZIP for usage information. It is recommended to
initially run job ALLOC to establish a user environment matching the
assumptions made in the other JCL members.
