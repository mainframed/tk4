Submit the ind$file.jcl and load the ind$file.het on the tape drive.

The jcl will install a the following load modules to SYS2.CMDLIB:
   IND$FILE CUT mode file transfer program
   CDPG1047 IBM code page 1047 to ISO-Latin-1 (aka 8859-1)
   CDPG037  IBM code page 037 to ISO-Latin-1 (aka 8859-1)
   CODEPAGE This is a copy of the CDPG1047 module.

Then it will execute the DBSTOP and DBSTART procedures to refresh 
the linklist bldl's.

This software was constructed using the Dignus Systems/C software,
http://www.dignus.com/ .

Currently IND$FILE only supports CUT mode file transfers which
limits the buffer size to that of the screen (24x80=~1900).

Please see the codepage.txt file if you need additional codepage
support or simply wish to alter the default code page supplied
for use with ind$file.
