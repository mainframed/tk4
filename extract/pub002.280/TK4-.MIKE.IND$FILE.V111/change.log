Version 1.0.0 Posted to files area.
1) First attempt at CUT mode support, only worked with TN3270 Plus
emulator.


Version 1.0.1 Never posted to files area.
Beta test release.  Sent to specific users only.


Version 1.0.2 Posted to files area.
1) Corrected data stream to be in same format as used by IBM's IND$FILE
program.

2) Externalized the code page translation table.  As delivered, ind$file
uses code page 1047 to ISO-Latin-1 which may or not be what you want.  Early
releases of MVS used code page 037 but more modern releases rely on code
page 1047.  The source for the code page is supplied should you wish to
construct your own code page table.

3) Added support for displaying data streams.  If you have problems with
this version, please allocate ddname stderr to sysout, run ind$file,
deallocate ddname stderr and send me the output.


Version 1.0.3
1) Made default code page member "CODEPAGE", if this fails to load then
code page member "CDPG1047" is loaded, if this fails then an error 
message is displayed and the program terminates with RC=12.

2) Added code page member CDPG037.

3) Changed default allocation for new files from 
CYL SPACE(1,1) to TRACKS SPACE(60,600) RELEASE.

Version 1.0.4
1) Corrected GET logic to send special EOF sequence before sending
TRANS03 Transfer complete message. (Thanks to Jim Morrison).

Version 1.0.5
1) Corrected bug in upper case translation routine. (Thanks to Jim Morrison)

Version 1.0.6
1) Corrected size of sequence number string which was causeing a null byte to be 
   sent as the 64th sequence number for large files. (Thanks to Jason Winter)


Version 1.1.0
1) Added TRACE option for handling trace output from IND$FILE.

2) Added ALT option to force IND$FILE to use Erase Write Alternate and the
   alternate screen size to build transfer buffers.  This is highly experimental
   at this time and not expected to work correctly with most terminals.
   So unless you have nothing better to do, don't use this option.

3) Added usage text that will be displayed when IND$FILE is issued without
   any parameters.  Also contains copyright notice and my email address.

Version 1.1.1
1) Added default screen size for terminals with logmode screen size 0 rows
   and 0 cols.  This now defaults to 24 x 80.

2) Updated copyright notice when IND$FILE self identifies. 
   Type IND$FILE by itself at the TSO READY prompt.
