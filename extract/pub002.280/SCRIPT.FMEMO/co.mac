.cm SCRIPT REFERENCE CO
.SUBT Purpose
CONCATENATE cancels a previous NO CONCATENATE control word and causes
output lines to be formed by
concatenating input lines and truncating at the nearest word boundary
to fit within the specified line length.

.SUBT Usage
The CONCATENATE control word specifies that output lines are to be
formed by shifting words to or from the
next input line. The resulting line will be as close to the line
length as is possible without exceeding it
or splitting a word.
.SUBT Defaults
This command
creates a break and is in effect until a ".CO
is encountered.  An omitted operand is treated as "YES".
