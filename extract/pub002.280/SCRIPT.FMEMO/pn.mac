.SUBT Usage
The .PN control word is used to control the automatic incrementing
of page numbers.  If OFFNO is specified, page numbers will not increase
as subsequent pages are output.  With OFF, external page numbering is
not incremented, but internal page numbering continues.  If ON is
specified, internal and external incrementing will resume.
.SUBT Defaults
This command word will not create a break.  Unless otherwise
specified "ON" will be in effect.  If an operand is missing then
"ON" will be assumed.
