.SUBT Purpose
The HYPHENATION control word is used to set the level of hyphenation
required and to manipulate the automatic hyphenation exception word
list.

.SUBT Usage
The .HY control word is used to set the desired level of hyphenation.
The "OFF" operand says that no hyphenation at all is desired and
that only blanks between words are to be considered for the
purpose of concatenating text.
.sp
The "USER" operand is one level higher in that words containing
hyphens, such as "brother-in-law", may be broken after a "-" when
concatenating text.
Secondly, the "USER" operand allows an input line to end with a hyphen
treating that as a conditional hyphen, so that the hyphen will remain
if needed as a break point within a word at the end of an
output line, but will be discarded if that point of the word
appears within a formatted output line.
.sp
The "ON" operand enables automatic hyphenation of words at
the end of formatted lines by employing some algorithms for English
words with an exception dictionary facility.
.sp
The "SET THRESH" defines the hyphenation threshold.
At least this number of spaces must remain at the end of a line
to be formatted before hyphenation will be attempted.
The value must be positive and has an initial and default
value of 5.
.sp
The "SET MINPT" defines the first hyphenation point beyond
the beginning of a word to be considered for hyphenation.
The initial and default value of 3 means at least three characters
at the start of a word will be kept together.
.sp
The "SET ENDPT" defines the minimum number of characters at the end
of a word to be considered for hyphenation.
The initial and default value of 3 means at least three characters
at the end of a word will be kept together.
.sp
The "SET SUP" defines the maximum number of consecutive output
lines that will  be eligible for automatic hyphenation.
After "n" successfully hyphenated lines on the same page, the
next output line will not be hyphenated.
.sp
For all of the Hyphenation "SET" options, a value of
zero means its largest possible value.
.sp
The "SUP" operand suppresses automatic hyphenation to the "OFF"
level until the next break occurs.
This is useful to effectively turn hyphenation off until the end
of a paragraph, at which point the current setting is restored.
.sp
The "ADD" operand is used to insert a user word into
the hyphenation exception word dictionary.
This is necessary to distinguish between words such as the noun
"pres-ent" and the verb "pre-sent".  A word may be specified
without break points such as "WATFIV" to prevent it from being
broken across output lines.
A word already in the dictionary may be added again as these
duplicates are entered in a last in, first out order.
.sp
The "CHANGE" operand operates as "ADD" if the alphabetic characters
of the word operand do not match any current entry.
If the characters do match an entry, that entry is replaced
with its new break points.
.sp
To "DELETE" a word, the letters of the word and its break points
must match.
.sp 1
To find all the hyphen break points of a word use the "TEST" operand.
SCRIPT will reflect the input word and all of its break points
on SYSTERM.
.sp
The "PURGE" operand is used to delete all words in the current
exception dictionary.
.sp
The exception word dictionary is also used because not all
English words hyphenate correctly when the algorithmic
rules are applied.
A master list of "common" exception words is distributed with this
version of SCRIPT and is normally accessible via
".IM
This master exception dictionary is never brought in automatically.
.ur .un &SYSIN
Beware -- each exception word requires sixteen bytes of storage
and the 2733 exception words in that list require some 44K
of main storage.
When running with multiple passes, care should be taken to add a large
exception dictionary only on the first pass as the exception dictionary
is not cleared between passes.
.sp
The "DUMP" operand may be used to list all words in the current
exception dictionary on the SYSTERM error file.
Note that the words do not list alphabetically but in order
by frequency of letter occurrence in English.
.SUBT Defaults
The HYPHENATION control word does not cause a break.
There is no default operand(s).  The initial setting of
the hyphenation level is "USER" with no entries in the
exception word dictionary.

.SUBT Notes
.of 4
(1) The automatic hyphenation rules employed have been taken
from a program package called HYPHENATION/360.
See the IBM Application Description Manual, form E20-0257,
for a clear description in ten pages of the algorithms employed.
