.cm SCRIPT REFERENCE LL
.SUBT Purpose
The LINE LENGTH control word specifies the number of horizontal
character positions which are to
be printed in subsequent output lines.
.SUBT Format
×
×  .LL          <6_0_×n×+n×-n>
×
.SUBT Usage
The .LL control sets the length of subsequent output lines to "n"
characters, where "n" is less than or equal to 144.
An operand of the form "+n" or "-n" first adds this value
algebraically to the current line length, so long
as the resulting value is not negative.
.SUBT Defaults
When this control word is encountered
it creates a break.  Unless otherwise specified _n
per line (including blanks) will be in effect.
If the operand is omitted then the value of the LLength=
parm will be taken, normally 60.
.SUBT Notes
.of 4
(1) Practically all terminals and printers print 10 characters per
horizontal inch.  The default value of 60 is sufficient
(when used in combination with ".AD
to give 1.5 inch left and 1 inch right margins.
