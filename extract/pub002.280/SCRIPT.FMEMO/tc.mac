.cm SCRIPT REFERENCE TC
.SUBT Purpose
The TABLE OF CONTENTS control word causes the current
Table of Contents to be printed.
The control words .H0 through .H9 and .PT are used to
generate entries in the Table of Contents.
.SUBT Format
×                <1_×n×* <C_O_N_T_E_N_T_S_×line>>
×  .TC           <ADD <m ... >>
×                <PURGE>
.SUBT Usage
.sp
Up to ten concurrent Table of Contents may be accumulated
for printing and the table printed by this command is
determined by the current .DH Table of Contents number.
.sp
The operand "n" of the .TC control word specifies
the number of pages reserved for the Table of Contents.
If the Table of Contents requires other
than n pages, a gap or overlap in pagination will occur.
A default of 1 page is used if this operand
is not specified. An operand of * causes page
numbering to proceed sequentially from the Table of
Contents to the text following.
.sp
The "line" operand is the phrase used for the
Table of Contents heading.
A default phrase of
.ur .us CONTENTS
is generated if "line" is omitted.
The heading is created by generating a pseudo
head-level 1 with an operand of
.ur .us CONTENTS
or "line".
The "line" operand would be formatted with head-level 1
options in effect from the Define Heading (.DH) control word.
This pseudo head-level becomes the first entry in the Table
of Contents and normally causes a page eject if not already
at the top of the page.
.sp
Entries in the Table of Contents are formatted according
to the line and page dimensions that are in effect
upon encountering the .TC control word.
.sp
The  ADD operand causes the Tables of Contents specified
by <m ... > to be added to the current Table of Contents.
Attempting to chain the current table to itself will
result in a null operation.
.sp
The PURGE operand will delete the current Table of
Contents.
.sp
The .TC control word is not allowed in a Floating Keep.
.SUBT Defaults
This control word will cause a break.
