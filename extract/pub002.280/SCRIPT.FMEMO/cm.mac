.SUBT Purpose

comments into a SCRIPT file.

.SUBT Usage
The .CM control word allows comments to be stored in the SCRIPT file.

or printed.
.sp
Comment lines may be used to store unique identifications for use
during editing of the file.
.SUBT Defaults
This command does not cause a break.
.SUBT Notes
.of 4
(1) Since only the first two characters of a control line
(exclusive of the control word indicator, normally ".")
are examined to determine what control word is present, and since
undefined reference names have null-string ("") values, a reference
name can be given the value 'CM' and used to control conditional
recognition of other control words.
(See Example 2).

.of 4
(2) If the control word cannot be identified then a first control
word character of asterisk "*" will be recognized as a comment that
goes to the very end of the current input record, regardless of
control word separators and other control words.
