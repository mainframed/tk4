.SUBT Usage
The .PL control word allows the use of various paper sizes
for output, by setting the length of subsequent output
pages to "n".  An operand of the form "+n" or "-n" first
adds this value algebraically to the current page length,
so long as the resulting value is greater than the
TOP MARGIN (.TM) plus BOTTOM MARGIN (.BM).
.sp 1
Normal 8.5" x 11" paper is 66 lines long on a IBM 1403
printer, an IBM 2741 type of terminal, or
any other device which types
6 lines per vertical inch.
.SUBT Defaults
This command word will create a break and unless otherwise
specified _n
If the operand is omitted then the value of the PLength=
parm will be taken, normally 66.
.SUBT Notes
.of 4
(1) Use of the .PL control word for any other purpose than specifying
the actual _p_h_y_s_i_c_a_l size of
the output page is discouraged.  The TOP MARGIN and
BOTTOM MARGIN control words should be used to
control the dimensions of printed text.
