.cm SCRIPT REFERENCE CP
.SUBT Purpose
The CONDITIONAL PAGE control word causes a page eject to occur if
insufficient lines remain on the current page for text.
.SUBT Format
×                <0_×n>
×  .CP
×                <BEGIN×END <0_×m>>
.SUBT Usage
The .CP control word will cause a page eject to occur if "n" lines do
not remain on the current page.
.sp
By putting ".CP
after, the length of the formatted block need not be known
and still a page eject will be generated before printing
the block if insufficient space is available on the current page.
The "END" operand may be further qualified with a numeric argument
"m" where this value is added to the length of the formatted block
before deciding if the block will fit on the current page.
.sp 1
This control word is especially useful:
.sp 1
.in +4
.un 4
(1) Before a .SP control word which is used to leave room for a drawn
figure.  Use of .CP will guarantee that
.FNADD
.ur all of the spaces are contiguous&LP..
.fn begin
.in
.ur .of &OFN
.ur (&NFN.) If a numeric argument is used with .CP, then .LE YES
must be specified if the spaces entered in this way are to be
left at the top of the next page.
.fn end
.sp 1
.un 4
(2) Preceding a section heading to insure that the heading will not
be left alone at the bottom of the page.
.SUBT Defaults
This command will not cause a break.
If "m" is omitted then zero is assumed.
If "n" is omitted or not positive then the command will
be ignored.
.br;.cp begin
.SUBT Notes
.of 4
(1) By "remainder of current page" it is meant "the area between the
last typed line and the beginning
of saved footnote text (if any) or the current bottom margin (if no
footnotes are saved)."
.cp end
.sp
.cp begin
.of 4
(2) A ".CP BEGIN/END" sequence within a Floating Block,
a Floating Keep or a Footnote is considered illegal.
