.cm SCRIPT REFERENCE AP
.SUBT Purpose
The APPEND control word allows an additional SCRIPT file to be
appended to the file just printed.
.SUBT Format
×               Filename              <n1><n2>
×  .AP                       <args> <.        >
×            Filename(member)         <label>
.SUBT
.fo
.sp
.in 5
Where:
.sp
.of 8
<args>  is a list of "n" elements separated by blanks, or delimited
strings separated by blanks, such that
special set reference symbol &1 is set to the value of the first,
&2 to the second, &n to the last and
&0 to "n" even if "n" is zero.
.sp
Alternatively, a keyword parameter may be set in this list of
arguments if it contains an equal sign, no undelimited blanks
and is a valid .SR assignment statement.
If keyword parameters are used then &0 will be set, even if zero.
.sp
The special reference symbol &* is set to the string of
all positional and keyword arguments.
.sp
When the default LOCAL option is specified, all of these
reference symbols are defined as local variables
and may only be used within the file being appended.
.sp
.of 8
.li 1
.       is the current control word indicator character, normally
period ".".
.sp
.of 8
n1      specifies the start of the range of records to be included.
.sp
.of 8
n2      specifies the end of the range of records to be included.
.sp
.of 8
label   specifies the label which marks the first record to be
included.
.SUBT Usage
When the .AP control word is encountered, the current SCRIPT file
will be closed.  Records "n1" through "n2" of the
file or records following ".LB label"
will be read and printed as a continuation of output already
produced.
.sp
Each "Filename" that has not been used in a previous IMBED or
APPEND
Control word must have an associated "DD Statement" or
"TSO FILE ALLOC" that references a dataset.
If the "DD
error message before closing all opened files.
.SUBT Defaults
The entire file is read in starting at the first line and no break is
created.
.SUBT Notes
.of 4
(1) "*" may be coded in place of "n1 n2" to indicate that the entire
file is to be read. If no arguments
appear after the filename, "*" is assumed.
.of 4
(2) If "n1" is coded, "*" may be coded in place of "n2" to indicate that
the entire file starting with item "n1" is to
be read. If the third argument is omitted, "*" is assumed.
.of 4
(3) The .AP control word only allows files to be appended
to the end of the current file.  If it is desired to
insert file contents at some point besides the end, the .IM control
word should be used.
.of 4
(4) If .AP FILENAME is used to supply the filename, a four
step procedure is followed in searching for the referenced file.
In order, a search is conducted for:
.br
.in 10
.of 4
-1-
A DD statement "FILENAME" which points to a sequential dataset.
.of 4
-2-
A DD statement "FILENAME" which points to a partitioned dataset,
which itself contains a member "FILENAME'.
.of 4
-3-
A member "FILENAME" in an active partitioned dataset.  (The
active partitioned datasets are searched for member "FILENAME"
in reverse order of opening.)
.of 4
-4-
A member "FILENAME" in the optional "SYSLIB" partitioned dataset.
.in 5
.sp
If nothing is found, a message is printed out and an empty
file is APpended.
.sp
If .AP FILENAME(MEMBERNAME) is used to supply the file name,
step -3- of the search is skipped, and in steps -2- and -4-, the
partitioned datasets in question are searched for a member named
"MEMBERNAME" not "FILENAME".
.SUBT Examples
.of 4
(a) .AP CHA4CONT
.br
The file named CHA4CONT SCRIPT will be read and formatted for output
as a continuation of the current SCRIPT file.  The value of
reference symbol "&0" is unchanged.  If the
reference symbol "&0" is set to zero.
The value of the reference symbol "&*" is set to the null string.
If the output is being created in batch, a "DD Statement" similar to
one of the statements below would have to be included in the job
setup for input of this file.
If CHA4CONT were a sequential file:
    //CHA4CONT DD DSNAME=xxxxxx,DISP=SHR
.sp
If CHA4CONT were a member of a library it could be referenced
by including a "SYSLIB DD" statement.
    //SYSLIB   DD DSNAME=xxxxxx,DISP=SHR
.sp
If CHA4CONT were a member of a particular partitioned dataset
the following "DD statement" would be necessary:
    //CHA4CONT DD DSNAME=xxxxxx(CHA4CONT),DISP=SHR
.sp
.of 4
.cp 4
(b) .AP FIG2 one 'one plus one' . 12 *
.br
The file named FIG2 will be read starting with record 12 and
output as a continuation of the current input file.  The value
of reference symbol "&0" will be set to "2", with "&1" and "&2"
taking values "one" and "one plus one" respectively.
The value of "&*" is set to "one 'one plus one'".
.sp
.of 4
.cp 4
(c) .ap TEST type=CHAPTER TITLE='New World' err(5)=4*4
.br
The file named TEST will be read with keywords TYPE, TITLE and
ERR set.  &0 will be set to zero.
