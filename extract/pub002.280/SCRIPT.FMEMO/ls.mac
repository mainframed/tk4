.SUBT Usage
Subsequent output lines will have "n" blank lines inserted after
each line of body text.
The operand may be signed, in which case the current line space
value is incremented or decremented.
A "YES" operand implies one line or
double spacing (See .DS).  A "NO" operand implies zero lines
or single spacing (See .SS).
.SUBT Defaults
This command does create a break.  An omitted operand
is treated as "Single Space".
