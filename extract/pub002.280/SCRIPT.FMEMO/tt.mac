.cm SCRIPT REFERENCE TT
.SUBT Purpose
The TOP TITLE control word is used to define three headings
to be printed at the top of both even and odd numbered pages.

where optional "n", from 1 to the value of the HSFSOVER option,
gives the heading line number,
and S1, S2 and S3 are character strings not containing the
delimiter character "/" which can be any character defined
as the first character of the operand.  Any of the fields may
be omitted, but the delimiter character must be included to
indicate missing fields, e.g., $S1$$S3$.
.SUBT Usage
The .TT control word specifies 3 items of character data to be
printed on one line near the top of all subsequent
.FNADD
.ur output pages&LP..
.fn begin
.in
.ur .of &OFN
.ur (&NFN.) Including the current page if nothing has yet been
written.
.fn end
.sp 1
The heading line is generated by:
.sp 1
.in +5
.of 4
(1) Substituting the current page number for each appearance of the
Page Number Symbol, normally "%".
.of 4
(2) Left-adjusting S1.
.of 4
(3) Centering S2.
.of 4
(4) Right-adjusting S3.
.sp 1
.in -5
If the top margin is t_m_, the heading margin h_m_ and the heading
space h_s_ the top of the output page will consist of:
.sp 1
.in +5
.cp 3;.of 4
(1) t_m_ - h_m_ - h_s_ blank lines,
.of 4
(2) the h_s_ heading lines and
.of 4
(3) h_m_ blank lines.
.SUBT Defaults
A break is not created by this command.
The default top title on each page after page one is
".tt
This default may be suppressed by .PN with an OFF or
OFFNO operand.
.SUBT Notes
.of 4
(1) S3 may overlay S2 if necessary, and S2 may overlay S1 if necessary.
.of 4
(2) Appearance of the .TT control word overrides any previous values
of the heading items.  If no
items are specified, an empty heading line will be
.FNADD
.ur generated&LP..
.fn begin
.in
.ur .of &OFN
.ur (&NFN.) Setting a null header or setting the Heading Space to
zero are the only ways to achieve the effect of an empty Top Margin.
.fn end
Furthermore, items which are omitted become null and do _n_o_t
retain their previous values.

(3) The Heading and Footing lines share the same buffers.  The first
to last are referenced by Heading 1 to 9 and the last to first
referenced by footing 1 to 9.  i.e. .TT
define the same Heading/Footing and .TT
the same, and so on.  Use .HS (Heading Space and .FS (Footing Space)
with the rule that their sum should not exceed 9 for discrete results.
The overlap value of nine is settable from 2 to 19 by using the
HSFSOVER parameter.
.of 4
(4) The TOP TITLE control has the same effect as the HEADING (.HE)
control word.
The difference is that the field delimiter is self-defined by the
first character of the operand.
