.SUBT Usage
This control word controls the number of heading lines to be
printed at the top of a page.
Up to HSFSOVER headings may be defined
and printed at the top of each page.
An operand of the form "+n" or "-n" adds
this value algebraically to the current heading space setting,
so long as the resulting value is not negative.
.sp 1
If the current top margin is t_m_, the heading margin is h_m_ and
the heading space is h_s_, the top of each page will appear as:
.sp 1
.in 10
.nf
(1) t_m_ - h_m_ - h_s_ blank lines,
(2) the h_s_ heading lines,
(3) h_m_ blank lines.
.SUBT Defaults
This command creates a break and until it is encountered _n
be in effect.  The value of the operand may be from zero to
the HSFSOVER option, normally nine.
If the operand is omitted _n
