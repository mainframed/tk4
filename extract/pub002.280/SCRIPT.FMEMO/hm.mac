and the first line of the text area.

.SUBT Usage
The last heading line produced on subsequent output pages will be
separated from the first line of text
by n_ blank lines.  An operand of the form "+n" or "-n" adds
this value algebraically to the current heading margin setting,
so long as the resulting value is not negative.
.sp 1
If the current top margin is t_m_, the heading margin is h_m_ and
the heading space is h_s_, the top of each page will appear as:
.sp 1
.in 10
.nf
(1) t_m_ - h_m_ - h_s_ blank lines,
(2) the h_s_ heading lines,
(3) h_m_ blank lines.
.SUBT Defaults
This command creates a break and until it is encountered _n
be in effect.
If the operand is omitted then the value of the HMargin=
parm will be taken, normally 1.
.SUBT Notes
.of 4
(1) The HEADING MARGIN plus HEADING SPACE must be less than or
equal to the TOP MARGIN.
