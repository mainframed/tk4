.SUBT Purpose
The PERFORM control word causes the remainder of the same or the next
input line to be executed multiple times.
.SUBT Format

×  .PE          <1_×n×YES×NO×DELETE>

.SUBT Usage
The PERFORM control word provides a primitive facility for DO-LOOPs.
The string following on the same input line is executed "n" times
before passing on to the next physical record.
A "YES" operand executes the line an
infinite number (actually 32,767) of times.
A "NO" or zero operand terminates processing of the current line
immediately.
Performs within performs are supported.
A "DELETE" operand terminates all nested levels of performs.
.SUBT Defaults
This control word does not cause a break.  An omitted operand
will be treated as one.
.SUBT Examples
.tr ^ .
.of 4
(1) To build a block of twenty asterisk lines, centered on the page:
.sp
^pe 20;^ce;*******************************
.sp
.of 4
(2) Alternatively the operand string to be performed may be entered
on the following input record:
.sp
^pe 20
.br
^ce;*******************************
.sp
.cp 15
.of 4
(3) To format the first 10000 numbers in paragraphs of 100:
.sp
.nf
^^^
^sr j=100;^cm paragraph count
^sr max=10000;^cm total number count
^rm 255 save nosave
^se i=&i+1
^se t=-&i/&j*&j+&i;^cm remainder mod j
^ur &i
^ur ^if &t = 0
^sp
^rm
^pe yes;^si 255;^ur ^if &i ge &max;^pe delete
^^^
.sp
.of 4
(4) Same example as above using nested perform:
.sp
^^^
^sr j=100;.* numbers per paragraph count
^sr max=10000;.* total number count
^sr i=0;.* clear starting value
^ur .pe &max/&j;.sp;.ur .pe &j;.se i=&i+1;.ur &i
^^^
.tr ^ ^
