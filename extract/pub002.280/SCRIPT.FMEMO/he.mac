.SUBT Purpose
The HEADING control word is used to define three headings to be
printed at the top of both even and odd numbered pages.
.SUBT Format
×                       S1
×  .HE           <1_×n>
×                       'S1'S2'S3'

where the optional "n", from 1 to the value of the HSFSOVER option,
gives the heading line number
and S1, S2 and S3 are character strings _n_o_t containing
quotation marks.  Any of the fields may be omitted,
but the quotation marks must be included
to indicate missing fields, e.g., 'S1''S3'.
.SUBT Usage
The .HE control word specifies 3 items of character data to be
printed on one line near the top of all subsequent
.FNADD
.ur pages&LP..
.fn begin
.in
.ur .of &OFN
.ur (&NFN.) Including the current page if nothing has yet been
written.
.fn end
.sp 1
The heading line is generated by:
.sp 1
.in 10
.of 4
(1) Substituting the current page number for each appearance of the
Page Number Symbol, normally "%".
.of 4
(2) Left-adjusting S1.
.of 4
(3) Centering S2.
.of 4
(4) Right-adjusting S3.
.sp 1
.in 5
If the top margin is t_m_, the heading margin h_m_ and the heading
space h_s_ the top of the output page will consist of:
.sp 1
.in 10
.of 4
(1) t_m_ - h_m_ - h_s_ blank lines,
.of 4
(2) the h_s_ heading lines and
.of 4
(3) h_m_ blank lines.
.SUBT Defaults
A break is not created by this command.  Unless otherwise
specified ".he
of output which will have a blank heading.
.SUBT Notes
.of 4
(1) The sum length of the three segments in the heading may not
exceed 240 characters.
.of 4
(2) S3 may overlay S2 if necessary, and S2 may overlay S1 if necessary.
.of 4
(3) The quotation marks are used to delimit the character strings,
_N_O_T to surround them.
.of 4
(4) Appearance of the .HE control word overrides any previous values
of the heading items.  If no
items are specified, an empty heading line will be
.FNADD
.ur generated&LP..
.fn begin
.in
.ur .of &OFN
.ur (&NFN.) Setting a null header or setting the Heading Space to
zero are the only ways to achieve the effect of an empty Top Margin.
.fn end
Furthermore, items which are omitted become null and do _n_o_t
retain their previous values.
.of 4
(5) The Heading and Footing lines share the same buffers.  The first
to last are referenced by Heading 1 to 9 and the last to first
referenced by Footing 1 to 9.  i.e. .HE
define the same Heading/Footing and .HE
the same, and so on.  Use .HS (Heading Space and .FS (Footing Space)
with the rule that their sum should not exceed the value of the
HSFSOVER option (normally 9) for discrete results.
