.cm SCRIPT REFERENCE PA
.SUBT Purpose
The PAGE control word causes an output page eject.
.SUBT Format
×                <%_+_1_×n×+n×-n <m×+m×-m>>
×  .PA
×                <YES×NO×ODD×EVEN>
.SUBT Usage
When the .PA control word is encountered, the rest of the current
page is skipped, any saved footnote lines
are printed, the Footing Space lines are printed,
and a new page is begin whose number is specified by the operand.
.sp
The "YES" operand is equivalent to the default.
The "NO" operand suppresses the page eject.
The "ODD" operand causes output to continue on the next
odd numbered page.
Similarly, "EVEN" continues on the next even page.
.sp 1
An operand of the form "n" will change the current page number
to the value specified; "+n" will increment the current page number
by "n"; "-n" will decrement the current page number by "n".
.sp
A second operand of the form "m" may optionally be specified.
If used then SCRIPT will number and count pages in the form
"n.m", incrementing "m" on each page.
Thus a chapter or an update could be numbered
3, 3.1, 3.2, ... by specifying ".PA
.SUBT Defaults
This command word does create a break when encountered.
If the operand is omitted then the current page number plus one
(%+1) is assumed.
.SUBT Notes
.of 4
(1) If the STOP option was specified in the control line which
invoked SCRIPT, output will cease at the end
of the current page to allow the typist to insert the next page of
paper.

(2) If the current page is empty and ".EM
the .PA control has no effect other than causing the page number
to be incremented or reset.  Consequently, heading lines
are not printed until there is a text line about to be printed.
This allows dynamic changes to page headings and possibly
remote lines imbedded in the text of that page.

(3) Heading lines, margins, etc., must be specified before the
first line of text which will appear on the new page.

(4) When using page numbers with a decimal portion, the even or odd
attribute is determined by summing the two portions of the page number.
Thus 3.0 is odd and 3.1 is even, 4.5 is odd and 4.6 is even.

(5) If the current page number is "3.4" then a ".pa" control
word would place the output at the top of page "4".
