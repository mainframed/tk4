 <RNF IS A TEXT FORMATTING PROGRAM FOR THE ^CYBER SIMILIAR TO THE
<RUNOFF PROGRAM AVAILABLE ON THE <DEC<SYSTEM-10.
 <RNF ACCEPTS (MOSTLY) FREE-FORMAT TEXT WHICH HAS BEEN PUT IN
A FILE AND EDITED BY <BOSS, AND PRODUCES OUTPUT SUITABLE FOR
A LINE PRINTER OR A TYPEWRITER-LIKE TERMINAL DEVICE.
.HL 1 ^FEATURES
 <RNF DOES ANY OR ALL OF THE FOLLOWING FOR THE USER:
.SAV .P -16 1 3 .LM 25 .TABS 25
 ^PAGINATION .T <RNF AUTOMATICALLY BREAKS TEXT UP INTO
PAGES, AND BY DEFAULT NUMBERS THEM SEQUENTIALLY.
 ^FILL .T ^USING THE MARGINS SET BY THE USER, <RNF
AUTOMATICALLY "FILLS" EACH LINE OF THE OUTPUT WITH AS MANY WORDS
AS IT CAN HOLD WITHOUT EXCEEDING THE RIGHT MARGIN.  ^FILLING
STOPS AT THE END OF A PARAGRAPH, ETC.
 ^JUSTIFICATION .T <RNF WILL OPTIONALLY JUSTIFY FILLED LINES
ON THE RIGHT, SO THAT THE RIGHT MARGIN "LINES UP" EVENLY.
 ^CHAPTERING .T <RNF WILL FORMAT CHAPTER TITLES, AND
NUMBER CHAPTERS SEQUENTIALLY.
 ^SECTIONING .T <RNF WILL FORMAT SECTION HEADERS AND NUMBER
SECTIONS AND SUBSECTIONS SEQUENTIALLY.
 ^LISTS .T <RNF WILL FORMAT AND NUMBER LISTS AND
SUBLISTS.
.RES
 ^IN ADDITION TO THE FEATURES WHICH ARE BUILT IN,
<RNF PROVIDES AN EASY TO USE MACRO FACILITY WHICH PERMITS
THE USER TO DEFINE COMMANDS WHICH ARE CUSTOMIZED TO A PARTICULAR
APPLICATION.
.HL 1 ^INPUT ^TEXT
 ^THE INPUT TO <RNF MAY BE PREPARED EITHER ON AN UPPER CASE ONLY
DEVICE LIKE A ^TELETYPE OR PUNCHED CARDS, OR ON AN UPPER/LOWER
CASE TERMINAL.  ^THESE ARE CALLED <NORMAL AND <ASCII DEVICES,
RESPECTIVELY.
 ^REGARDLESS OF THE INPUT MEDIUM, OUTPUT FROM <RNF IS IN UPPER/LOWER
CASE.  ^THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY THE FOLLOWING CONVENTIONS:
.HL 2 <NORMAL ^INPUT
 ^BY CONVENTION, <RNF INVERTS THE CASE OF ALPHABETIC CHARACTERS IN
THE INPUT.
^UPPER CASE CHARACTERS ARE INDICATED BY A PRECEDING _^.  ^FOR
EXAMPLE, THE FOLLOWING <NORMAL INPUT
.ASCII
 .I 9 _^THIS IS AN _^U_^P_^P_^E_^R/LOWER CASE LINE.
.NOASCII
 IS OUTPUT BY <RNF AS
 .I 9 ^THIS IS AN <UPPER/<LOWER CASE LINE.
 ^AS A CONVENIENCE, THE _< CHARACTER WILL INVERT THE CASE OF ALL
ALPHABETIC CHARACTERS WHICH FOLLOW IT IN THE SAME WORD.
^FOR EXAMPLE,
.ASCII
 .I 9 _^SOME _<UPPER _<CASE AND SOME LOWER CASE.
 .I 9 SOME_<OF_<BOTH
.NOASCII
 ARE OUTPUT AS
 .I 9 ^SOME <UPPER <CASE AND SOME LOWER CASE.
 .I 9 SOME<OF<BOTH
 ^IN EXCHANGE FOR THIS CONVENIENCE, THE CHARACTERS _^ AND _@ MUST
BE REPRESENTED IN <NORMAL INPUT AS _@^B AND _@^A, RESPECTIVELY.
.HL 2 <ASCII ^INPUT
 ^UPPER/LOWER CASE TEXT CAN BE ENTERED IN A FILE BY USING <ASCII
MODE IN <BOSS.  ^WHEN SUBMITTED TO <RNF, THIS TEXT MUST BE PRECEDED
BY AN <.ASCII COMMAND.
^THE _< CHARACTER WORKS THE SAME.
.HL 1 <WORDS
 <RNF INPUT IS A SERIES OF WORDS, WHERE A WORD IS ANY SEQUENCE
OF NON-BLANK CHARACTERS.
 ^BLANKS IN THE INPUT TEXT ARE NOT (USUALLY) SIGNIFICANT TO
<RNF, EXCEPT THAT THEY DELIMIT WORDS.  <RNF INSERTS ONE
BLANK BETWEEN EACH WORD, AND TWO BLANKS AFTER WORDS WHICH
END SENTENCES.
 ^IF A SEQUENCE OF BLANKS MUST APPEAR IN THE OUTPUT, THE
SIGNIFICANT BLANK CHARACTER _# IS USED.  ^FOR EXAMPLE,
BE_#_#_#_#TWEEN IS OUTPUT AS BE####TWEEN.
.HL 1 <LINES
 ^IN DEFAULT MODE, WORDS ARE
PICKED FROM THE INPUT ONE BY ONE AND PLACED INTO AN OUTPUT
LINE.  ^WHEN AN OUTPUT LINE IS FULL, IT IS WRITTEN INTO THE
OUTPUT FILE.
 ^THE USER SETS THE LEFT AND RIGHT MARGINS OF THE OUTPUT PAGE
BY THE <.LM AND <.RM COMMANDS, RESPECTIVELY.
^TEXT ON THE OUTPUT LINE IS WRITTEN BEGINNING AT THE LEFT MARGIN
AND NOT PAST THE RIGHT MARGIN.
 ^FILLING MEANS THAT (UNLESS THE USER SPECIFICALLY DIRECTS OTHERWISE)
AS MANY WORDS AS POSSIBLE ARE USED TO FILL EACH OUTPUT LINE.
 ^JUSTIFICATION MEANS THAT BLANK CHARACTERS ARE ADDED BETWEEN
WORDS SO THAT THE LAST CHARACTER ON EACH LINE IS EXACTLY ON THE
RIGHT MARGIN.
 ^THE <.F AND <.J COMMANDS CONTROL FILLING AND JUSTIFICATION.
 ^THE DEFAULT LEFT MARGIN IS 1 AND THE DEFAULT RIGHT MARGIN IS
72.  ^FOR ^ELITE TYPE (12 CHARACTERS PER INCH) THIS PRODUCES
A 6-INCH WIDE LINE, WHICH ALLOWS 1 AND 1/4 INCH MARGINS ON
STANDARD 8 AND 1/2 INCH PAPER.  ^FOR ^PICA TYPE (10 CHARACTERS
PER INCH) <.LM 1 AND <.RM 60 PROVIDE THE SAME SIZE LINE.
 ^FOR MOST PURPOSES, IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT THE LEFT MARGIN BE
INITIALLY SET TO 1, AS THIS IS EASY TO WORK WITH AND REMEMBER.
^IF THE TEXT MUST BE SHIFTED TO THE RIGHT FOR OUTPUT ON A
TYPEWRITER PAGE, THE <.RIGHT COMMAND MAY BE USED.
.HL 1 <SPACING
 ^THE INPUT TO <RNF IS SINGLE SPACED.  ^THE OUTPUT MAY BE SINGLE
SPACED, DOUBLE SPACED, OR TRIPLE SPACED AS THE USER CHOOSES.
 ^SPACING IS SET BY THE <.SP COMMAND,.
^ONCE SET, <RNF WILL AUTOMATICALLY
CONTROL SPACING WITHOUT REQUIRING ANY FURTHER ACTION
ON THE PART OF THE USER.  ^IF EXTRA SPACES OR NON-STANDARD SPACING
IS DESIRED, HOWEVER, <RNF PROVIDES COMMANDS FOR THESE, TOO.
 ^THE <.CR COMMAND PROVIDES THE EQUIVALENT OF A CARRIAGE RETURN
KEY ON AN ELECTRIC TYPEWRITER.  ^THE <.CR ENDS THE CURRENT LINE
AND SPACES AS SET BY <.SP.  ^THAT IS, IF SINGLE SPACING IS
SELECTED (<.SP 1), THE <.CR "RETURNS THE CARRIAGE" TO THE NEXT
LINE; IF DOUBLE SPACING IS SELECTED (<.SP 2), THE <.CR LEAVES
A SINGLE BLANK LINE AFTER THE CURRENT LINE, AND SO ON.  ^THROUGHOUT
THIS MANUAL, THE ACTION OF THE <.CR IS REFERRED TO AS A "RETURN".
^MANY COMMANDS CAUSE A RETURN AS A PRELUDE TO FURTHER ACTION.
 ^THE <.S COMMAND CAUSES A RETURN, FOLLOWED BY ANY NUMBER OF EXTRA
RETURNS.
<.S AND <.S#1 MEAN THE SAME, I.E., A RETURN AND ONE EXTRA RETURN.
<.S#2 PROVIDES TWO EXTRA RETURNS, AND SO ON.
 <.CR AND <.S ALWAYS HONOR THE SPACING SET BY <.SP.  ^THE USER
CAN ESCAPE SPACING BY MEANS OF THE <.BR AND <.B COMMANDS.
 <.BR PROVIDES A "BREAK"; IT RETURNS THE CARRIAGE AND PROCEEDS
ON THE NEXT LINE, REGARDLESS OF SPACING.  <.B CAUSES ANY NUMBER
OF BLANK LINES AFTER THE CURRENT LINE.  <.B AND <.B#1 MEAN THE
SAME: BREAK AND LEAVE ONE BLANK LINE AFTER THE CURRENT LINE.
<.B#2 LEAVES TWO BLANK LINES, AND SO ON.
 ^THUS, THE USER CAN CREATE SPACING INDEPENDENT TEXT BY USING
ONLY <.CR AND <.S COMMANDS FOR SPACING.  <.BR AND <.B ARE USED
WHEN SPACING IS TO BE FIXED REGARDLESS OF THE <.SP SETTING.
.HL 1 <PARAGRAPHS
 <RNF PROVIDES BOTH EXPLICIT AND AUTOMATIC PARAGRAPHING FACILITIES.
^THE <.P COMMAND CONTROLS THE INDENTATION, SPACING, AND LOCATION
OF EACH PARAGRAPH.  ^THE <.PP COMMAND BEGINS A NEW PARAGRAPH.
 ^AUTOPARAGRAPHING, CONTROLLED BY THE <.AP COMMAND, CAUSES AN
IMPLICIT <.PP COMMAND EACH TIME EITHER A BLANK LINE OR A LINE
BEGINNING WITH BLANK IS ENCOUNTERED IN THE INPUT TEXT.
^THIS IS A CONVENIENT FORMAT FOR TEXT ENTRY, AND ALLOWS
EASY MODIFICATION.
^BY USE OF THE <.SP (^S^PACING) AND <.P COMMANDS, THE SAME INPUT
TEXT CAN BE USED FOR PRODUCING BOTH DOUBLE (OR TRIPLE) SPACED DRAFTS
AND SINGLE SPACED FINAL COPY.
 ^PARAGRAPHING IS SUFFICIENTLY FLEXIBLE TO BE USED FOR
"HANGING INDENTS".
^IN ADDITION, THE FACT THAT PARAGRAPH INDENTATION CAN BE
SPECIFIED RELATIVE TO THE LEFT MARGIN (EVEN IF IT IS LATER
CHANGED) ALLOWS PARAGRAPHING TO BE CONVENIENTLY USED IN
INDENTED TEXT.
.HL 1 <PAGES
 ^LINES ARE AUTOMATICALLY SEPARATED INTO PAGES BY <RNF.
^TWO COMMANDS CONTROL THE SIZE OF <RNF PAGES: <.PS (^PAGE ^SIZE)
AND <.LINES.
 ^THE FIRST ARGUMENT OF <.PS SPECIFIES THE NUMBER OF LINES WHICH
ARE ALLOWED ON A PAGE BEFORE AN AUTOMATIC PAGE THROW IS DONE.
^THIS NUMBER INCLUDES THE LINES IN THE HEADER AT THE TOP OF EACH
PAGE, AND THE NORMAL TEXT ON THE PAGE, BUT DOES NOT INCLUDE THE
LINES IN THE FOOTER (IF ANY) AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE.
^THE <.LINES COMMAND SPECIFIES THE NUMBER OF LINES ON THE
ENTIRE PAGE.  ^THIS NUMBER IS USED WHEN SIMULATING PAGE EJECTS
ON TERMINALS WITH CONTINUOUS FORMS.
 ^THE DEFAULT <.PS FIRST ARGUMENT AND <.LINES ARE 58 AND 66,
RESPECTIVELY.  ^THIS ALLOWS AT LEAST A 1 AND 1/3 INCH BOTTOM
MARGIN WITH 6 LINE PER INCH PRINTING, AND A 1 INCH MARGIN WITH
LINE PER INCH PRINTING ON STANDARD <CSO REDUCED FORMS.
 ^SOME TERMINALS USE REDUCED FORMS BUT PRINT 6 LINES PER INCH.
^THIS MEANS THERE ARE 51 LINES ON EACH PAGE; A <.PS FIRST ARGUMENT
OF 44 WILL ALLOW A 1 INCH BOTTOM MARGIN.
.HL 2 ^EXPLICIT PAGING CONTROL
 ^THE <.PAGE COMMAND ALLOWS THE USER TO ADVANCE TO THE NEXT PAGE
EXPLICITLY.  ^THE <.NMP AND <.PNO COMMANDS CONTROL PAGE NUMBERING,
AND THE <.TITLE, <.ST, AND <.ATITLE COMMANDS PROVIDE FOR PRINTING
TITLES AT THE TOP OF EACH PAGE.
.HL 2 ^PAGE ^FORMAT
 ^A PAGE IS DIVIDED INTO THREE AREAS:
.BDOT .DOT ^THE TOP, WHICH CONTAINS THE UPPER MARGIN AND OPTIONAL
TITLES AND PAGE NUMBER.
.DOT ^THE MIDDLE, WHICH CONTAINS THE TEXT OF THE DOCUMENT.
.DOT ^THE BOTTOM, WHICH MAY CONTAIN A FOOTER.  (^BY DEFAULT, NO
FOOTER IS PRINTED.)
.EDOT
 ^THE DEFAULT HEADER CONSISTS OF AN OPTIONAL TITLE ON THE LEFT AND
THE PAGE NUMBER AS AN ^ARABIC NUMBER ON THE RIGHT OF THE FOURTH
LINE ON THE PAGE.
^THE SUBTITLE, IF ANY, IS BELOW THE TITLE ON THE FOLLOWING LINE.
^TWO BLANK LINES ARE LEFT BELOW THE HEADER.
 ^IF THIS DEFAULT FORMAT IS NOT SATISFACTORY FOR A SPECIFIC
DOCUMENT, THE USER MAY SUBSTITUTE ANY ARBITRARY HEADER AND
FOOTER TEXT BY MEANS OF A <.FRCPAGE MACRO DEFINITION (SEE ^CHAPTER 3)
AND USE OF THE PAGING INTRINSICS <.TOP, <.MID, AND <.BOT.
 ^THE PAGE NUMBER USED BY <RNF MAY BE ACCESSED DIRECTLY THROUGH
THE PREDEFINED VARIABLE <$$PAGE (SEE ^CHAPTER 4).
.MACRO CHTTL = ^COMMANDS
.CH <COMMANDS
 ^ANY SEQUENCE OF NON-BLANK CHARACTERS BEGINNING WITH A PERIOD
(.) ARE TAKEN BY <RNF TO BE A COMMAND.  ^IF THE COMMAND IS NOT
RECOGNIZED, AN ERROR MESSAGE IS PRODUCED.
 ^MANY COMMANDS REQUIRE ARGUMENTS, I.E., WORDS WHICH FOLLOW
THE COMMAND AND MODIFY ITS ACTION IN SOME WAY.
^THE ONLY COMMANDS WHICH PERMIT A VARIABLE NUMBER OF ARGUMENTS
ARE <.TAB (OR <.TABS), <.B, AND <.S.
IF ANY OTHER COMMAND REQUIRES AN ARGUMENT, IT MUST BE SPECIFIED.
 ^COMMANDS MAY BE FREELY INTERSPERSED WITH TEXT.  ^SOME COMMANDS
CAUSE A "RETURN" (THAT IS, ACT AS IF THEY WERE PRECEDED BY A
<.CR COMMAND) AS A PART OF THEIR ACTION.  ^IF A COMMAND CAUSES
A RETURN, THIS IS INDICATED IN PARENTHESIS AFTER THE COMMAND
FORMAT.
^OTHER COMMANDS CAUSE A "BREAK" (THAT IS, ACT AS IF THEY WERE
PRECEDED BY A <.BR COMMAND) AS A PART OF THEIR ACTION.
^THESE ARE INDICATED BY (^BREAK) IN PARENTHESIS.
 ^NOTE THAT A BLANK MUST FOLLOW A COMMAND IF THERE IS MORE TEXT ON
THE SAME LINE.  ^FOR EXAMPLE, THE SEQUENCE "<.B.I#5" IS IN ERROR;
IT MUST BE WRITTEN AS "<.B#.I#5".
.LM 9
.TAB 72
.P -4 2 4
 <.AP
.B ^ANY BLANK LINE OR ANY LINE BEGINNING WITH A BLANK CHARACTER
BEGINS A NEW PARAGRAPH.  ^SEE THE <.P AND THE <.PP COMMANDS.
<.NOAP TURNS AUTOPARAGRAPHING OFF AND IS THE DEFAULT.
 <.ARRAY VARIABLENAME N
.B ^THIS COMMAND DECLARES AN ARRAY VARIABLE WITH THE NAME SPECIFIED
AND N+1 ELEMENTS.  ^AN ELEMENT OF THE ARRAY IS LATER ACCESSED OR
CHANGED BY A REFERENCE OF THE FORM:
.B .I 9 VARIABLENAME[EXPRESSION]
.B WHERE EXPRESSION MAY BE IN THE RANGE 0 THROUGH N.
^THE ZEROETH ELEMENT OF THE ARRAY MAY BE REFERRED TO WITHOUT
A [0] SUBSCRIPT, AND IS COMMONLY USED AS AN INDEX INTO THE
REMAINDER OF THE ARRAY.
.B ^ALL ARRAY ELEMENTS HAVE THE INITIAL VALUE ZERO. ^ARRAY NAMES
MUST BE FORMED AS DEFINED FOR THE <.VAR COMMAND.
 <.ASCII
.B ^THE INPUT WAS PREPARED IN <ASCII MODE ON AN UPPER/LOWER CASE
TERMINAL.
^WHEN IN <ASCII MODE CAHRACTERS ARE NOT AUTOMATICALLY CASE INVERTED. ^AL
EFFECT OF THE _^ CHARACTER IS REVERSED, IN <ASCII MODE _^ LOWERS A CAPIT
LETTER AND DOES NOTHING TO A LOWER CASE LETTER.
^THE DEFAULT IS <.NOASCII.
 <.ASIS .RT (^RETURN)
.B ^TERMINATES THE CURRENT INPUT LINE AND ENTERS AS IS MODE BEGINNING
WITH THE NEXT INPUT LINE.
.B ^IN AS IS MODE, INPUT LINES ARE COPIED DIRECTLY TO THE OUTPUT
(EXCEPT THAT THE LEFT MARGIN, CHANGE BARS, AND <.RIGHT SPACING
ARE STILL HONORED).
.B ^AS IS MODE IS TERMINATED BY A LINE WITH AN EXCLAMATION MARK
(!) IN COLUMN 1.  ^ALL CHARACTERS AFTER THE EXCLAMATION MARK ARE
IGNORED, AND NORMAL PROCESSING BEGINS WITH THE FOLLOWING LINE.
.B ^NOTE THAT AS IS TEXT WHICH IS INTENDED TO BE OUTPUT
AS UPPER/LOWER CASE (<ASCII) MUST BE INPUT IN <ASCII.
.U ^NO .NOU PROCESSING IS DONE ON AS IS TEXT.
 <.ATITLE
.B ^ENABLES AUTOTITLING, WHICH MAKES EACH NEW CHAPTER HEADING
THE TITLE FOR ALL BUT THE FIRST PAGE OF THE CHAPTER.  ^THE
DEFAULT IS <.NOATITLE.
   <.AUTOCAP
.B ^ENABLES THE AUTO CAPITALIZATION, WHICH MAKES THE CHARACTER FOLLOWING
A _., _!, _?, REMAIN IN UPPER CASE. ^THIS IS DISABLED IN <ASCII MODE.
^IT TAKES EFFECT AFTER THE FIRST PUNCTUATION MARK, SO IT MAY NOT AFFECT
TITLES OR THE FIRST LINE. <NOAUTOCAP IS THE DEFAULT.
 <.B .RT (^BREAK)
.BR .I -4 <.B N .RT (^BREAK)
.B ^ENDS THE CURRENT LINE AND WRITES IT WITHOUT FURTHER FILLING
OR JUSTIFICATION (CAUSES A BREAK), THEN WRITES N BLANK LINES.
<.B AND <.B#1 ARE EQUIVALENT.
 <.BAR
.B ^ENABLES CHANGE BARS.  ^ALL TEXT FOLLOWING THE <.BAR COMMAND
IS SHIFTED RIGHT THREE SPACES.  ^SEE THE <.BB AND <.EB COMMANDS.
^THE DEFAULT IS <.NOBAR.
 <.BB
.B ^BEGIN PLACING CHANGE BARS (VERTICAL BARS) IN THE MARGIN
CREATED BY THE <.BAR COMMAND BEGINNING WITH THE LINE WHICH
CONTAINS THE FIRST WORD IN THE TEXT FOLLOWING THE <.BB COMMAND.
^SEE THE <.EB COMMAND.
 <.BOT
.B ^SETS THE BEGINNING OF USER TEXT (ON THE PAGE) TO THE CURRENT OUTPUT
NUMBER
AND RESTORES ANY OUTPUT LINES WHICH MIGHT HAVE
BEEN SAVED ON A FORCED PAGE EJECT (SEE <.FRCPAGE).
^IF ANY DEFERRED TEXT IS PENDING (SEE THE <.FIG COMMAND), AS MUCH OF IT
AS POSSIBLE IS OUTPUT BY <.BOT.  ^IF AS IS MODE WAS IN EFFECT AT THE TIM
THE LAST <.FRCPAGE, IT IS RESTORED.
.B ^THE <.BOT
COMMAND IS TO BE USED ONLY WHEN OVERRIDING THE DEFAULT
HEADER FORMAT VIA MACROS.
.B ^THE <.B AND <.S COMMANDS HAVE NO EFFECT AT THE BEGINNING
OF USER TEXT ON A PAGE.  ^THIS PREVENTS SPURIOUS BLANK LINES AT THE TOP
OF A TEXT PAGE.
 <.BR .RT (^BREAK)
.B ^ENDS THE CURRENT OUTTPUT LINE AND WRITES IT WITHOUT FURTHER
FILLING OR JUSTIFICATION.  ^NO EXTRA BLANK LINES ARE LEFT BY
<.BR, REGARDLESS OF SPACING.
 <.C TEXT .RT (^RETURN)
.B ^CENTERS THE TEXT WHICH FOLLOWS THE <.C COMMAND ON THE
SAME LINE.  ^CENTERING IS BETWEEN THE CURRENT LEFT AND RIGHT
MARGINS.
 <.CH TITLE .RT (^RETURN)
.B ^BEGINS A NEW CHAPTER WITH THE TITLE WHICH FOLLOWS ON THE
SAME LINE.  ^A NEW PAGE IS BEGIN, TITLES AND SUBTITLES ARE
CLEARED, A <.FIG 12 IS DONE, FOLLOWED BY THE WORD <CHAPTER
CENTERED, A <.B, FOLLOWED BY THE TITLE CENTERED.  ^PAGE NUMBERING
IS NOT AFFECTED.  ^IF <.ATITLE IS ON, THE CHAPTER TITLE IS
SET AS THE <.TITLE FOR SUCCEEDING PAGES.
 <.CR .RT (^RETURN)
.B ^CAUSES A CARRIAGE RETURN, WHICH IS A <.BR FOLLOWED BY
SPACING MINUS ONE BLANK LINES.
.B ^NOTE THAT <.CR IS IMPLIED BEFORE ANY COMMAND FOR WHICH
(^RETURN) IS INDICATED.
 <.DEBUG1
.B ^CAUSES ALL FOLLOWING LINES TO BE PREFIXED WITH THE RELATIVE
LINE NUMBER OF THE PAGE. ^THIS PRECEDES THE CARRIAGE CONTROL, IF ANY.
<.DEBUG1 ALSO INCLUDES <.DEBUG2. <.NODEBUG1 IS THE DEFAULT. ^THIS
IS USEFUL FOR FINDING PROBLEMS WHEN CREATING A DOCUMENT WITH MANY PAGE E
 <.DEBUG2
.B ^CAUSES ALL FOLLOWING LINES TO BE TRAILED BY THE INPUT LINE NUMBER ON
EXTREME RIGHT MARGIN (NOT NECESARILY THE MARGIN SET BY <.RM). ^THIS IS
VERY USEFUL FOR DOCUMENT PREPARATION, TO CORRELATE A PROBLEM TO THE INPU
CAUSING IT. <.NODEBUG2 IS THE DEFAULT.
 <.DEC VARIABLENAME
.B ^DECREMENT THE VARIABLENAME.
 <.DELMAC MACRONAME
.B ^DELETES THE MACRO NAME, SO THAT IT MAY BE REUSED.
 <.DOT
.B ^CAUSES ALL FOLLOWING <.T OR <.RT COMMANDS TO FILL WITH DOTS (PERIODS
INSTEAD OF SPACES.  ^A BLANK IS ALWAYS LEFT BEFORE AND AFTER
THE STRING OF DOTS.
<.NODOTS RETURNS TO FILLING TABS WITH SPACES.
 <.EB
.B ^END CHANGE BARS.  ^THE LAST LINE FLAGGED IS THE ONE WHICH
CONTAINS THE WORD JUST PRECEDING THE <.EB COMMAND.
 <.ELIST
.B ^END LIST.  ^TERMINATES THE INNERMOST ACTIVE LIST.  ^SEE
THE <.LIST COMMAND.
 <.ESC
.B ^ENABLES THE ESCAPE CHARACTER __ (BACKARROW OR UNDERLINE).
^WHEN ENABLED, THE ESCAPE CHARACTER CAUSES THE CHARACTER WHICH
FOLLOWS IT TO BE COPIED TO THE OUTPUT TEXT WITHOUT SPECIAL
ACTION. ^FOR EXAMPLE, 23__. CAUSES 23_. TO BE TYPED WITHOUT
AN EXTRA TRAILING BLANK.  ^THE DEFAULT IS <.ESC.
 <.F
.B ^FILLS EACH OUTPUT LINE WITH AS MANY WORDS FROM THE INPUT
AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT EXCEEDING THE RIGHT MARGIN.
^BLANKS ARE REMOVED FROM THE INPUT.  ^EACH WORD OF THE OUTPUT
IS FOLLOWED BY AT LEAST ONE BLANK, WHILE WORDS WHICH END IN
_., _!, OR _? ARE FOLLOWED BY AT LEAST TWO BLANKS.
<.NOF SUPPRESSES FILL.
 <.FIG N
.B ^RESERVES N LINES FOR A FIGURE.  ^IF THE LINES WILL FIT ON THE
CURRENT PAGE, <.FIG CAUSES A RETURN AND LEAVES N BLANK LINES.
^IF NOT, N BLANK LINES ARE LEFT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE NEXT
PAGE.
 <.FLAG
.B ^CAUSES _^ AND _@ TO BE RECOGNIZED AS FLAG CHARACTERS.
<.FLAG IS THE DEFAULT; <.NOFLAG SUPPRESSES RECOGNITION.
 <.FLAGCAPS
.B ^CAUSES THE _< CHARACTER TO INVERT THE CASE OF ANY LETTERS
IN A WORD WHICH FOLLOW IT.  ^FOR EXAMPLE, <_<UP_<AND_<THEN_<DOWN
IS OUTPUT AS <UP<AND<THEN<DOWN.
<.NOFLAG SUPPRESSES SPECIAL ACTION FOR THE _< CHARACTER.
<.FLAG IS THE DEFAULT.
 <.FLAGOVER
.B ^THE <.FLAGOVER COMMAND ENABLES RECOGNITION OF _\ (BACKSLASH)
AS THE STRIKEOVER CHARACTER.  ^THE STRIKEOVER CHARACTER
IS WRITTEN BETWEEN THE CHARACTER TO BE OVERSTRUCK AND THE CHARACTER
WHICH IS TO OVERSTRIKE IT.  ^FOR EXAMPLE, <STRIKEO_\/VER IS
OUTPUT AS <STRIKEO\/VER.
.B ^UNDERLINING COUNTS AS ONE OVERSTRIKE.  ^ANY CHARACTER MAY BE
OVERSTRUCK UP TO THREE TIMES.  ^OVERSTRIKING MAY BE USED ONLY
WITHIN A WORD; THE OVERSTRIKE CHARACTER HAS NO MEANING BY ITSELF
OR BEGINNING A WORD.
.B <.FLAGOVER IS THE DEFAULT.  <.NOFLAGOVER TURNS IT OFF.
 <.FLAGSIG
.B ^THE <.FLAGSIG COMMAND ENABLES RECOGNITION OF _# (SHARP)
AS THE SIGNIFICANT BLANK CHARACTER.  <.FLAGSIG IS THE DEFAULT.
<.NOFLAGSIG TURNS IT OFF.
 <.FRCPAGE
.B ^THIS COMMAND IS USED INTERNALLY BY <RNF TO FORCE A PAGE
EJECT.  ^THAT IS, IF A LINE IS ABOUT TO BE WRITTEN WHICH WOULD
EXCEED THE PAGE SIZE, THE LINE IS SAVED, AND A <.FRCPAGE COMMAND
IS EXECUTED AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN ENCOUNTERED IN THE INPUT
TEXT.
 .B ^THE <.FRCPAGE COMMAND ITSELF INVOKES THE EQUIVALENT OF
<.TOP, PRINTS THE NEXT PAGE HEADER, AND INVOKES THE EQUIVALENT
OF <.MID.
.B ^THE USER MAY ADD A FOOTER OR REFORMAT THE PAGE HEADER BY
DEFINING A MACRO WITH THE NAME <.FRCPAGE.  ^THIS REPLACES THE
<.FRCPAGE COMMAND, AND MUST INVOKE THE <.TOP AND <.MID COMMANDS
(AND OPTIONALLY THE <.BOT COMMAND) EXPLICITLY.  ^FOR CORRECT
OPERATION, THE .U FIRST .NOU WORD IN THE <.FRCPAGE MACRO MUST
BE EITHER <.BOT OR <.TOP, AND THE LAST WORD SHOULD BE <.MID.
.B ^NOTE THAT <.FRCPAGE DOES NOT RETURN, NOR CAN IT, SINCE A
RETURN CAN CAUSE A PAGE EJECT, WHICH WILL CAUSE A <.FRCPAGE
TO BE INVOKED RECURSIVELY.
^THE <.PAGE COMMAND DOES RETURN, AND IN FACT IS DEFINED AS
<.BR <.FRCPAGE.
 <.FMT N1 N2
.B ^FORMATS THE VALUE OF N2 ACCORDING TO THE FORMAT CODE SPECIFIED
BY N1.  ^N1 AND N2 MAY BE EXPRESSIONS (SEE ^CHAPTER 4).  ^N1 MUST
BE IN THE RANGE 0 THROUGH 5, AND HAS A MEANING AS FOLLOWS:
.SAV .LM +11 .TAB 20 .P -7 1 5
.B
.I -11 .U ^VALUE .T ^FORMATS#N2#AS... .NOU
 0 .T ^ARABIC NUMBERS.  ^THAT IS, <.FMT 0 IS A NO-OP EXCEPT
THAT IT FORCES OUTPUT OF N2.
 1 .T ^UPPER CASE ALPHABETIC CHARACTERS, WHERE N2=1 PRODUCES
THE CHARACTER <A, N2=2 PRODUCES <B, ETC.  (^NOTE THAT IN FACT
N2=N PRODUCES THE NTH CHARACTER IN THE ALPHABET, WHERE
N IS TAKEN MODULO 26.)
 2 .T ^LOWER CASE ALPHABETIC CHARACTERS, WHERE N2=1 PRODUCES
THE CHARACTER A, ETC.  (^THE ACTION IS THE SAME AS THAT OF FORMAT
EXCEPT THAT THE CHARACTER IS LOWER CASE.)
 3 .T ^UPPER CASE ^ROMAN NUMERALS.  (^THE NUMERALS PRODUCED
ONLY MAKE USE OF THE CHARACTERS <M, <D, <C, <L, <X, <V, AND <I.)
 4 .T ^LOWER CASE ^ROMAN NUMERALS.  (^THE NUMERALS PRODUCED
ONLY MAKE USE OF THE CHARACTERS M, D, C, L, X, V, AND I.)
 5 .T ^THE ^N2TH CHARACTER OF THE CHARACTER SET. ^THIS IS USEFUL FOR PRI
CHARACTERS NOT AVAILABLE ON THE ENTRY DEVICE.
.RES
 <.HL N HEADING .RT (^RETURN)
.B ^BEGINS A NEW SECTION WITH THE HEADING SPECIFIED AND AUTOMATICALLY
NUMBERS IT.  ^THE N IN THE <.HL COMMAND MUST BE IN THE RANGE 1 THROUGH
5. ^SECTION NUMBERS HAVE THE FORM I.J.K.L.M.
^IF A <.CH COMMAND PRECEEDED THE <.HL COMMAND, I IS THE CHAPTER NUMBER;
OTHERWISE IT IS THE NUMBER OF <.HL 1 COMMANDS.
^WITHIN ^CHAPTER 2, THE SEQUENCE <.HL#1, <.HL#2, <.HL#3, <.HL#3, <.HL#2,
<.HL#1 PRODUCES SECTIONS NUMBERED 2.1, 2.1.1, 2.1.1.1, 2.1.1.2, 2.1.2,
AND 2.2.
.B ^THREE BLANK LINES ARE LEFT BEFORE EACH SECTION, AND TWO BLANK
LINES FOLLOW THE SECTION HEADER.
 <.I #N .RT (^RETURN)
.BR .I -4 <.I +N .RT (^RETURN)
.BR .I -4 <.I -N .RT (^RETURN)
.B ^INDENT THE FOLLOWING LINE.  ^IF N IS SPEC^IFIED, IT INDICATES THE
COLUMN NUMBER AT WHICH THE LINE IS TO BEGIN.  ^IF +N OR -N ARE SPECIFIED
THE INDENT IS PLUS OR MINUS N CHARACTERS FROM THE LEFT MARGIN.
 <.IF EXPRESSION TEXT
.B ^THE <.IF COMMAND TESTS THE VALUE OF THE EXPRESSION. ^IF IT
IS ZERO, THE TEXT ON THE REMAINDER OF THE LINE IS SKIPPED; OTHERWISE
THE TEXT IS SCANNED NORMALLY.  <.IF PROVIDES A SINGLE LINE CONDITIONAL
CAPABILITY.
.B ^FOR A DEFINITION OF EXPRESSIONS ACCEPTABLE TO <.IF, SEE
^CHAPTER 4, <VARIABLES.
 <.INC VARIABLENAME
.B INCREMENT THE FOLLOWING VARIABLE.
 <.J
.B ^JUSTIFY TEXT AT THE RIGHT MARGIN.  ^THIS IS THE DEFAULT.
^JUSTIFICATION IS ACCOMPLISHED BY INSERTING EXTRA BLANKS BETWEEN
WORDS WHEN NECESSARY.  (^NOTE THAT A SIGNIFICANT BLANK, THE
_# CHARACTER, IS NEVER EXPANDED.)# <.NOJ TURNS JUSTIFICATION OFF.
 <.LE .RT (^RETURN)
.B ^BEGINS A LIST ELEMENT.  ^THE ELEMENT IS AUTOMATICALLY NUMBERED
AND INDENTED.  ^SEE THE <.LIST AND <.ELIST COMMANDS.
 <.LINES N
.B ^SETS THE NUMBER OF LINES IN THE OUTPUT PAGE,
INCLUDING THE TOP AND BOTTOM MARGINS.  <DEFAULT N IS 66.  ^THE
CORRECT SETTING FOR 6 LINE PER INCH DEVICES USING 8 LINE PER INCH
PAPER (LIKE <CSO'S <DEC<WRITERS) IS 51.
 <.LIST N .RT (^RETURN)
.B ^BEGINS A LIST WITH N SPACING.  ^EACH ELEMENT OF THE LIST
IS AUTOMATICALLY NUMBERED BEGINNING AT 1.  ^LISTS MAY BE NESTED
WITHIN LISTS, FOR UP TO 5 LEVELS.  ^A LIST IS TERMINATED BY
A <.ELIST COMMAND.  ^EACH LIST IS INDENTED ON THE RIGHT; THE
OUTERMOST LIST IS INDENTED 9 CHARACTERS, AND EACH INNER LIST
IS INDENTED 4 MORE.
 <.LOWER .B ^FORMATS THE OUTPUT IN UPPER/LOWER CASE. ^LOWER IS THE DEFAU
 <.LPT
.B ^PREPARE OUTPUT FOR A LINE PRINTER, WITH CARRIAGE CONTROL IN
THE FIRST CHARACTER POSITION OF EACH LINE.  ^THE DEFAULT IS <.LPT.
<.NOLPT PREPARES OUTPUT FOR AN INTERACTIVE TERMINAL.
 <.LM N
.B ^SET THE LEFT MARGIN TO N.
^N MUST BE IN THE RANGE 1 THROUGH 136 (IN PARTICULAR, <.LM 0
IS FLAGGED AS AN ERROR).
^SEE <.RM ALSO.
 <.MACRO NAME ##= TEXT
.BR .I -4 <.MACRO NAME N = TEXT
.BR .I -4 <.MACRO NAME * = TEXT
.B ^DEFINES A MACRO WITH THE NAME SPECIFIED EQUAL TO THE TEXT ON THE
REMAINDER OF THE SAME LINE.  ^WHEN _.NAME IS ENCOUNTERED LATER, THE TEXT
IS SUBSTITUTED FOR IT.
.B ^IF N, AN INTEGER FROM 1 TO 7, IS SPECIFIED, IT INDICATES THE MACRO
HAS N ARGUMENTS.  ^THIS IMPLICITLY DEFINES MACROS NAME1,NAME2...NAMEN,
WHICH HAVE A TEXT VALUE EQUAL TO THE N WORDS WHICH FOLLOW THE MACRO WHEN
IT IS INVOKED.
.B ^IF * IS SPECIFIED, IT INDICATES THAT THE MACRO HAS ONE ARGUMENT.
^THE ARGUMENT IS THE IMPLICITLY DEFINED MACRO NAME1, AND HAS A TEXT
VALUE EQUAL TO THE ENTIRE REST OF THE LINE ON WHICH THE MACRO IS
INVOKED.
.B ^FOR AN EXTENDED DISCUSSION AND EXAMPLES, SEE ^CHAPTER 3, <MACROS.
 <.MID .RT (^RETURN)
.B ^THE <.MID COMMAND ENDS A USER-DEFINED <.FRCPAGE MACRO.
<.MID OUTPUTS ANY DEFERRED TEXT, FOLLOWED BY ANY LINES SAVED
PRIOR TO <.FRCPAGE, THEN SETS THE BEGINNING OF USER TEXT
TO THE CURRENT LINE.  ^THIS LATTER SUPPRESSES BLANK LINES
AT THE "TOP OF THE PAGE" CAUSED BY EITHER <.S OR <.B.

.MACRO CHTTL = ^MACROS
.CH <MACROS
^USER-DEFINED <RNF MACROS PROVIDE A MEANS OF:
.BDOT
.DOT ^EXTENDING THE SET OF <RNF COMMANDS BY ADDING MACROS TAILORED
TO A SPECIFIC APPLICATION.
.DOT ^ABBREVIATING COMMONLY USED SERIES OF <RNF COMMANDS.
.DOT ^ABBREVIATING COMMONLY USED PHRASES OR LONG WORDS.
.EDOT
^FOR EXAMPLE, THE FOLLOWING MACRO DEFINITIONS WERE USED TO PRODUCE
THE DOTTED LIST ABOVE:
.MACRO EX = .SAV .LM +9 .NOF .NOJ .S 1
.MACRO EEX = .RES .S 1
.EX <.MACRO <BDOT = <.SAV <.P -2 1 5 <.LM +5
<.MACRO <DOT = <.PP __._# <.X
<.MACRO <EDOT = <.RES <.S 1
.EEX
WHILE THE FOLLOWING TWO MACROS WERE USED TO FORMAT THE ABOVE
(AND FOLLOWING) EXAMPLES:
.EX <.MACRO <EX = <.SAV <.LM +9 <.NOF <.NOJ <.S 1
<.MACRO <EEX = <.RES <.S 1
.EEX
AND SO ON!
 ^THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IS INTENDED TO GIVE THE USER SOME
INSIGHT INTO POTENTIAL USES OF MACROS WHILE
DEMONSTRATING HOW EASY MACROS ARE TO DEFINE AND USE.
.HL 1 <WHAT <MACROS <ARE
 ^MACROS HAVE TWO PARTS: A NAME, AND SOME TEXT.  ^THE NAME IS
A SINGLE WORD LONG, WHILE THE TEXT MAY BE ZERO OR MORE WORDS LONG.
 ^THE EFFECT OF A MACRO IS SIMILIARLY EASY TO DESCRIBE: WHEREVER
THE NAME OF THE MACRO APPEARS <RNF REMOVES IT AND SUBSTITUTES
THE TEXT.
 ^FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE FOLLOWING MACRO IS DEFINED:
.EX <.MACRO <CDC = ^CONTROL ^DATA ^CORPORATION
.EEX
WHENEVER <.CDC APPEARS IN THE INPUT, <RNF REMOVES IT AND SUBSTITUTES
^CONTROL ^DATA ^CORPORATION.
.MACRO NOTE * = .SAV .S 2 .LM +15 .RM -15 .P +0 1 5 .C .NOTE1 .S 1
.MACRO ENOTE = .RES .S 2
.NOTE ^NOTE THE ^DOTS
^THE MACRO NAME IS DEFINED WITHOUT A PRECEDING PERIOD (DOT).
^BUT WHEN THE MACRO IS USED, THE NAME MUST BE PRECEDED BY A DOT.
.ENOTE
.HL 1 <HOW <TO <DEFINE <A <MACRO
 ^THE SIMPLEST FORM OF MACRO DEFINITION IS:
.EX <.MACRO NAME = TEXT
.EEX
WHERE NAME IS THE NAME OF THE MACRO, AND TEXT REPRESENTS ALL THE
TEXT ON THE REST OF THE SAME LINE.
 ^AFTER THE MACRO DEFINITION, WHEREVER _.NAME APPEARS <RNF REMOVES
IT AND SUBSTITUTES THE TEXT.
.HL 1 <SUB-MACROS
 ^ALL MACRO EXPANSIONS ARE CONSIDERED TO TAKE PLACE ON THE SAME INPUT
LINE AS THE "OUTERMOST" MACRO CALL.  ^THUS, MACROS CAN BE PARAMETERIZED
IN A SIMPLE WAY BY ENDING A MACRO EXPANSION WITH A COMMAND
AND TYPING THE COMMAND ARGUMENT(S) AFTER THE MACRO CALL.  ^FOR EXAMPLE,
.EX <.MACRO <RIGHTMARG = <.RM
.EEX
WHICH COULD BE USED BY
.EX <.RIGHTMARG 65
.EEX
^BUT, AS THE EXAMPLE SHOWS, THIS APPROACH IS MOSTLY LIMITED TO TRIVIAL
COMMAND REPLACEMENTS.
^SUB-MACROS PROVIDE THE ABILITY TO PARAMETERIZE MACROS IN A MORE USEFUL
FASHION.
.HL 2 ^DEFINING ^PARAMETERIZED ^MACROS
 ^MACROS WITH SUB-MACROS ARE DEFINED BY THE FORMATS:
.EX <.MACRO NAME N = TEXT
-OR-
<.MACRO NAME * = TEXT
.EEX
^THE N IN THE FORMAT STANDS FOR A NUMBER IN THE RANGE 1 THROUGH 7.
^IT MEANS THAT THE 1 THROUGH 7 WORDS FOLLOWING THE MACRO CALL ON THE
SAME LINE ARE DYNAMICALLY MADE THE VALUES OF THE SUB-MACROS NAME1,
NAME2, _... ,NAME7.
 ^SUB-MACROS HAVE A DEFINED VALUE ONLY WHEN THE MACRO IS BEING
EXPANDED.
 ^IF AN ASTERISK IS USED INSTEAD OF A NUMBER N, IT MEANS THAT ALL
THE WORDS WHICH FOLLOW THE MACRO CALL ON THE SAME LINE ARE DYNAMICALLY
MADE THE VALUE OF THE SUB-MACRO NAME1.
 ^FOR EXAMPLE,
.EX <.MACRO <Z 2 = ^I HOPE YOU ARE <.Z1 <.X ING <.Z2 <.X ! .EEX
^WHEN <.Z IS CALLED, THE SUB-MACROS <.Z1 AND <.Z2 ARE GIVEN
VALUES EQUAL TO THE TWO WORDS WHICH FOLLOW <.Z ON THE SAME LINE.
^THUS, THE CALL
.EX <.Z FOLLOW ME .EEX
PRODUCES THE TEXT
.EX ^I HOPE YOU ARE FOLLOWING ME! .EEX
.HL 2 ^SUB-MACRO ^SEMANTICS
^SINCE THE PARAMETERS OF A MACRO ARE DEFINED AS MACROS THEMSELVES,
THEY MAY BE USED IN ANY MACRO CALLED WHILE THE SUB-MACROS ARE
DEFINED, AND NEED NOT BE "PASSED DOWN" FROM MACRO TO MACRO.
 ^IF NO WORDS OR NOT ENOUGH WORDS FOLLOW THE CALL OF A MACRO
WITH SUB-MACROS, THE SUB-MACROS ARE GIVEN NULL VALUES.  ^THAT
IS, UNLESS THERE IS ACTUALLY A WORD CORRESPONDING TO A SUB-MACRO,
IT EXPANDS TO NOTHING AT ALL.
.MACRO CHTTL = ^VARIABLES
.CH <VARIABLES
 <RNF ALLOWS THE USER TO DEFINE AND USE NUMERIC VARIABLES.
^THESE ARE HANDY (AND ARE USED INTERNALLY) FOR KEEPING TRACK OF
PAGE NUMBERS, CHAPTER NUMBERS, HEADER LEVELS, ETC.
.HL 1 <VARIABLE <SYNTAX
 ^VARIABLES ARE WORDS WHICH BEGIN WITH A DOLLAR SIGN ($),
FOLLOWED BY FROM 1 TO 9 LETTERS, NUMBERS, OR _$ CHARACTERS.
^THE CASE OF VARIABLE NAMES IS NOT SIGNIFICANT, E.G., <$HILO AND <$<HILO
ARE THE SAME VARIABLE.
 ^THE FIRST CHARACTER AFTER THE LEADING _$ CANNOT BE A NUMBER.
^THIS IS SO CHARACTER COMBINATIONS OF THE FORMS _$_<BLANK> AND
_$_<NUMBERS> ARE NOT RECOGNIZED AS VARIABLES, MAKING A NUISANCE
FOR THE USER.
 ^USERS SHOULD NOT DECLARE VARIABLES WITH TWO LEADING DOLLAR
SIGNS, AS THIS IS THE FORMAT USED BY PRE-DECLARED <RNF SYSTEM
VARIABLES.
 ^FOR EXAMPLE, THE FOLLOWING ARE VALID VARIABLE NAMES:
.TP 8
.EX <$A
 <$VARIABLE
 <$<N$
 <$L23
.EEX
WHILE THE FOLLOWING ARE INVALID:
 .EX <$100
 <$
.EEX
.HL 1 <HOW <TO <DECLARE <VARIABLES
 ^VARIABLES ARE DECLARED BY THE <.VAR COMMAND, WHICH HAS THE FORMAT:
.EX <.VAR _$NAME
.EEX
^NOTE THAT THE VARIABLE NAME IS BOTH DECLARED AND USED WITH A
LEADING _$.
 ^THE EFFECT OF <.VAR IS TO ALLOCATE SPACE FOR A NUMERIC VARIABLE,
GIVE IT THE NAME SPECIFIED, AND INITIALIZE THE VARIABLE TO ZERO.
 <RNF PROVIDES 75 SPACES FOR USER-DEFINED VARIABLES IN ADDITION
TO PREDEFINED VARIABLES.
.HL 1 <PREDEFINED <VARIABLES
 ^AS A CONVENIENCE TO THE USER, ^RNF MAKES USE OF SEVERAL PREDEFINED
VARIABLES WHILE PERFORMING VARIOUS COMMANDS.  ^THE PREDEFINED
VARIABLES ARE:
.SAV .LM +17 .P -12 0 1 .TAB 18
.B
 <$$PAGE .T ^CURRENT PAGE NUMBER.
 <$$CH .T ^CURRENT CHAPTER NUMBER.
 <$$HL .T ^CURRENT HEADER LEVEL.  ^ALSO DEFINED ARE <$$HL[1] THROUGH
<$$HL[5], WHICH CONTAIN THE CURRENT COUNTS AT EACH LEVEL.
 <$$LIST .T ^CURRENT LIST LEVEL.  ^ALSO DEFINED ARE <$$LIST[1]
THROUGH <$$LIST[10], WHICH CONTAIN THE CURRENT COUNTS AT EACH
LEVEL.
 <$$LM .T ^CURRENT LEFT MARGIN, SET BY <.LM.
 <$$RM .T ^CURRENT RIGHT MARGIN, SET BY <.RM.
 <$$SP .T ^CURRENT SPACING, SET BY <.SP.
 <$$NMP .T ^PAGE NUMBERING FLAG, SET BY <.NMP.
.RES
 ^THE VALUES OF THE PREDEFINED VARIABLES MAY BE EXAMINED OR
CHANGED BY THE USER AT ANY TIME. (^OF COURSE, CHANGING THESE
VALUES WILL AFFECT THE OPERATION OF THE BUILT IN <RNF FEATURES
WHICH USE THEM.)
.HL 1 <VARIABLE <ARRAYS
 ^ARRAYS MAY BE DECLARED BY THE <.ARRAY COMMAND, WHICH HAS THE
FORMAT:
.EX <.ARRAY _$NAME N .EEX
^THE EFFECT OF THIS DECLARATION IS THAT _$NAME IS DECLARED TO
BE AN N+1 ELEMENT ARRAY, WHICH MAY BE REFERENCED AS _$NAME[0]
THROUGH _$NAME[N].
 ^THE SUBSCRIPT MAY BE OMITTED IF THE ZEROETH ELEMENT OF THE
ARRAY IS BEING REFERENCED.  ^THAT IS, _$NAME[0] AND _$NAME
ARE EQUIVALENT.  ^THIS CONVENTION IS ADOPTED SO THAT A SINGLE
DECLARATION CAN ALLOCATE BOTH AN N-ELEMENT ARRAY AND AN
INDEX VARIABLE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ARRAY.
(^THE PREDECLARED ARRAYS <$$HL AND <$$LIST ARE USED IN THIS FASHION.)
 ^NOTE THAT THE ARRAY DECLARATION REQUIRES N+1 SPACES OF THE
ALLOWED FOR USER VARIABLES.
.HL 1 <EXPRESSIONS
 ^AN EXTREMELY USEFUL FEATURE OF <RNF IS THE ABILITY TO COMBINE
VARIABLES, NUMBERS, AND OPERATORS INTO EXPRESSIONS WHICH COMPUTE
A NUMERIC VALUE.
^THE VALUES COMPUTED BY THE EXPRESSIONS CAN IN TURN INDEX ARRAYS,
BE ASSIGNED TO VARIABLES, OR BECOME A PART OF THE OUTPUT TEXT.
.HL 2 ^EXPRESSION ^SYNTAX
 ^AN EXPRESSION IS DEFINED AS FOLLOWS:
.TAB 20 27
.EX EXPR .T ::= .T TERM _< RELOP TERM >
.NOPERIOD
 RELOP .T ::= .T <.EQ. × <.NE. × <.LT. × <.LE. × <.GT. × <.GE.
.PERIOD
 TERM .T ::= .T ITEM _< _< + × - > ITEM >...
 ITEM .T ::= .T _< + × - × _# > ELEMENT
 ELEMENT .T ::= .T ( TERM) × VAR × INTEGER
 VAR .T ::= .T _$ID _< [ TERM ] > _< = TERM >
.EEX
 ^THE ANGLE BRACKETS _< AND > IN THE SYNTAX EXPRESSIONS ENCLOSE
OPTIONAL PARTS.  ^THE CONSTRUCTION
.EX _< STUFF >...
.EEX
 INDICATES THAT STUFF IS ALLOWED TO APPEAR ZERO OR MORE TIMES.
^NOTE THAT ANGLE BRACKETS ARE USED TO DESCRIBE EXPRESSIONS; THEY
DO NOT APPEAR IN EXPRESSIONS.
 ^THE _# CHARACTER IN AN EXPRESSION REPRESENTS A LOGICAL <NOT
OPERATION.  ^THE EXPRESSION _#X HAS THE VALUE 1 IF X EQUALS
, OTHERWISE IT HAS THE VALUE 0.
 ^THE BLANKS IN THE SYNTAX EXPRESSIONS ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT AND IN FACT
BLANKS ARE NOT PERMITTED IN EXPRESSIONS.  ^THAT IS, AND EXPRESSION MUST
BE A SINGLE WORD.
 ^SOME EXAMPLES OF VALID EXPRESSIONS ARE:
.EX <$A.GR.5
 <$HL[$HL+1]=0
 <2+$$PAGE
 <$X[$X=$X+1]=$X[$X]+1
 <$A=$B=$C
.EEX
.HL 2 ^EXPRESSION ^EVALUATION
 ^EXPRESSIONS ARE EVALUATED FROM LEFT TO RIGHT, EXCEPT THAT
ASSIGNMENTS (INDICATED BY THE = SIGN) AT THE SAME LEVEL ARE
DONE FROM RIGHT TO LEFT.
 ^IN THE EXAMPLES ABOVE, <$X[$X=$X+1]=$X[$X]+1 IS EQUIVALENT
TO THE SERIES OF EXPRESSIONS <$X=$X+1 <$X[$X]=$X[$X]+1.
(^RECALL THAT THE ZEROETH ELEMENT OF AN ARRAY CAN BE REFERENCED
WITHOUT SUBSCRIPTS.)#  ^ON THE OTHER HAND, THE EXPRESSION
<$A=$B=$C IS EQUIVALENT TO <$B=$C <$A=$B.
.HL 2 ^WHERE ^EXPRESSIONS ^ARE ^USED
 ^AN EXPRESSION CAN ALWAYS BE USED AS AN ARGUMENT TO A COMMAND
WHICH REQUIRES A NUMERIC VALUE.
 ^AN EXPRESSION CAN ALSO APPEAR IN TEXT.  <RNF DECIDES WHETHER
TO EVALUATE AN EXPRESSION IN TEXT OR NOT BASED ON WHETHER THE
FIRST CHARACTER IS A _$.  ^IF IT IS, <RNF EVALUATES THE EXPRESSION;
OTHERWISE THE EXPRESSION IS TREATED LIKE ANY OTHER TEXT WORD.
 ^FOR EXAMPLE, THE EXPRESSION <$A+2 WILL BE EVALUATED, WHILE
<2+$A WILL NOT.
^IF <$A HAS THE VALUE 3, THE FORMER WILL APPEAR IN THE OUTPUT
AS "5", WHILE THE LATTER WILL APPEAR AS <"2+$A".
 ^FOR THE FEW CASES WHEN IT IS NOT CONVENIENT TO BEGIN AN EXPRESSION
TO BE EVALUATED WITH A VARIABLE NAME, THE SYNTAX:
.EX <$(<EXPR)
.EEX
WILL CAUSE EXPR TO BE EVALUATED.
.HL 2 ^SUPPRESSED ^EXPRESSIONS
 ^FREQUENTLY, ONE WISHES TO COMPUTE A VALUE AND ASSIGN IT TO
A VARIABLE -- THAT IS, EVALUATE AN EXPRESSION -- WITHOUT
PLACING ANYTHING AT ALL IN THE OUTPUT TEXT.  ^THIS IS DONE
BY TERMINATING THE EXPRESSION WITH A SEMICOLON.
 ^FOR EXAMPLE, THE WORDS:
.EX
.EX <.VAR <$A ^SEE <$A=$A+1; ONLY <$A OF THESE.
.EEX
ARE OUTPUT AS
.EX ^SEE ONLY 1 OF THESE.

.c Using <rno Tabs
.ap
 <rno tab stops are set by the <.tabs command.  The format is:
 .i 9 <.tabs c1 c2 <... c15
 where c1 through c15 are character positions, in ascending order,
where the tab stops are to be set.
(Character positions are numbered beginning at 1). To work
correctly, tab stops must not be set beyond the right margin.
 Tabs are used by the <.t command, which means "begin the next
word at the next tab stop".
 For example, the following
 .i 9 <.tabs 10 20 30 40
.br .i 9 Line <.t this <.t up <.t in <.t columns
 produces
.tabs 19 29 39 49
 .i 9 Line .t this .t up .t in .t columns
 The following features should be noted:
.tab 30 .p -21 2 5 .lm 30
 Justification .t Having tabs in a line does not suppress
justification.  Only the text after the last tab in a line is blank
padded.  This permits convenient use of "hanging" titles and
indentation.
 Left/Right .t Tabs produced by <.t cause the following
word to begin at the next tab stop.  The <.rt
command causes the following word to end at the
next tab stop.  This permits creating tables of numeric
data.

.C ^USING <RNO ^TABS
.AP
 <RNO TAB STOPS ARE SET BY THE <.TABS COMMAND.  ^THE FORMAT IS:
 .I 9 <.TABS C1 C2 <... C15
 WHERE C1 THROUGH C15 ARE CHARACTER POSITIONS, IN ASCENDING ORDER,
WHERE THE TAB STOPS ARE TO BE SET.
(^CHARACTER POSITIONS ARE NUMBERED BEGINNING AT 1). ^TO WORK
CORRECTLY, TAB STOPS MUST NOT BE SET BEYOND THE RIGHT MARGIN.
 ^TABS ARE USED BY THE <.T COMMAND, WHICH MEANS "BEGIN THE NEXT
WORD AT THE NEXT TAB STOP".
 ^FOR EXAMPLE, THE FOLLOWING
 .I 9 <.TABS 10 20 30 40
.BR .I 9 ^LINE <.T THIS <.T UP <.T IN <.T COLUMNS
 PRODUCES
.TABS 19 29 39 49
 .I 9 ^LINE .T THIS .T UP .T IN .T COLUMNS
 ^THE FOLLOWING FEATURES SHOULD BE NOTED:
.TAB 30 .P -21 1 5 .LM 30
 ^JUSTIFICATION .T ^HAVING TABS IN A LINE DOES NOT SUPPRESS
JUSTIFICATION.  ^ONLY THE TEXT AFTER THE LAST TAB IN A LINE IS BLANK
PADDED.  ^THIS PERMITS CONVENIENT USE OF "HANGING" TITLES AND
INDENTATION.
 ^LEFT/^RIGHT .T ^TABS PRODUCED BY <.T CAUSE THE FOLLOWING
WORD TO BEGIN AT THE NEXT TAB STOP.  ^THE <.RT
COMMAND CAUSES THE FOLLOWING WORD TO END AT THE
NEXT TAB STOP.  ^THIS PERMITS CREATING TABLES OF NUMERIC
DATA.
