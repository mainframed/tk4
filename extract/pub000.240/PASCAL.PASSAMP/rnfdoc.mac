        Introduction               RNF







                                       CHAPTER 1

                                     INTRODUCTION




        RNF is a text formatting program for the Cyber similiar  to  the
        program available on the DECsystem-10.

        RNF accepts (mostly) free-format text which has been put in a  f
        edited  by  BOSS,  and  produces output suitable for a line prin
        typewriter-like terminal device.



        1.1  Features


        RNF does any or all of the following for the user:

         Pagination      RNF automatically breaks text up  into  pages,
                         default numbers them sequentially.

         Fill            Using the margins set by the  user,  RNF  autom
                         "fills"  each  line of the output with as many
                         it  can  hold  without  exceeding  the  right
                         Filling stops at the end of a paragraph, etc.

         Justification   RNF will optionally justify filled lines on the
                         so that the right margin "lines up" evenly.

         Chaptering      RNF will format chapter  titles,  and  number
                         sequentially.

         Sectioning      RNF will format section headers and number sect
                         subsections sequentially.

         Lists           RNF will format and number lists and sublists.

        In addition to the features which are built in, RNF provides an
        use  macro  facility which permits the user to define commands w
        customized to a particular application.

        1.2  Input Text


        The input to RNF may be prepared either on an  upper  case  only
        like  a  Teletype  or punched cards, or on an upper/lower case t
        These are called NORMAL and ASCII devices, respectively.

        Regardless of the input medium, output from RNF is in upper/lowe
        This is accomplished by the following conventions:



        1.2.1  NORMAL Input


        By convention, RNF inverts the case  of  alphabetic  characters
        input.   Upper  case  characters  are  indicated  by a preceding
        example, the following NORMAL input

         ^THIS IS AN ^U^P^P^E^R/LOWER CASE LINE.

        is output by RNF as

         This is an UPPER/lower case line.

        As a convenience, the < character will invert the case of all al
        characters which follow it in the same word.  For example,

         ^SOME <UPPER <CASE AND SOME LOWER CASE.

         SOME<OF<BOTH

        are output as

         Some UPPER CASE and some lower case.

         someOFboth

        In exchange for this  convenience,  the  characters  ^  and  @
        represented in NORMAL input as @B and @A, respectively.



        1.2.2  ASCII Input


        Upper/lower case text can be entered in a file by using  ASCII
        BOSS.   When  submitted  to RNF, this text must be preceded by a
        command.  The < character works the same.

        Introduction               RNF


        1.3  WORDS


        RNF input is a series  of  words,  where  a  word  is  any  sequ
        non-blank characters.

        Blanks in the input text are not (usually) significant  to  RNF,
        that  they  delimit words.  RNF inserts one blank between each w
        two blanks after words which end sentences.

        If a sequence of blanks must appear in the output, the significa
        character # is used.  For example, be####tween is output as be



        1.4  LINES


        In default mode, words are picked from the input one by one  and
        into  an  output  line.  When an output line is full, it is writ
        the output file.

        The user sets the left and right margins of the output page by
        and  .RM  commands,  respectively.   Text  on the output line is
        beginning at the left margin and not past the right margin.

        Filling means that (unless the user specifically directs  otherw
        many words as possible are used to fill each output line.

        Justification means that blank characters are  added  between  w
        that the last character on each line is exactly on the right mar

        The .F and .J commands control filling and justification.

        The default left margin is 1 and the default right margin  is  7
        Elite  type  (12  characters per inch) this produces a 6-inch wi
        which allows 1 and 1/4 inch margins on standard 8 and  1/2  inch
        For Pica type (10 characters per inch) .LM 1 and .RM 60 provide
        size line.

        For most purposes, it is recommended that the left margin  be  i
        set  to  1, as this is easy to work with and remember.  If the t
        be shifted to the right for output on  a  typewriter  page,  the
        command may be used.

        1.5  SPACING


        The input to RNF is single spaced.  The output  may  be  single
        double spaced, or triple spaced as the user chooses.

        Spacing is set by the .SP command,.  Once set,  RNF  will  autom
        control  spacing without requiring any further action on the par
        user.  If extra spaces or non-standard spacing is desired, howev
        provides commands for these, too.

        The .CR command provides the equivalent of a carriage return key
        electric typewriter.  The .CR ends the current line and spaces a
        .SP.  That is, if single spacing is selected (.SP 1), the  .CR
        the  carriage"  to the next line; if double spacing is selected
        the .CR leaves a single blank line after the current line,  and
        Throughout  this  manual,  the  action  of  the  .CR is referred
        "return".  Many commands cause a return as a prelude to further

        The .S command causes a return, followed by any number of extra
        .S  and  .S 1  mean the same, i.e., a return and one extra retur
        provides two extra returns, and so on.

        .CR and .S always honor the spacing set by .SP.   The  user  can
        spacing by means of the .BR and .B commands.

        .BR provides a "break"; it returns the carriage and proceeds on
        line,  regardless of spacing.  .B causes any number of blank lin
        the current line.  .B and .B 1 mean the same: break and leave on
        line after the current line.  .B 2 leaves two blank lines, and s

        Thus, the user can create spacing independent text by using only
        .S  commands  for  spacing.   .BR  and .B are used when spacing
        fixed regardless of the .SP setting.



        1.6  PARAGRAPHS


        RNF provides both explicit and automatic paragraphing  facilitie
        .P  command  controls  the  indentation,  spacing,  and location
        paragraph.  The .PP command begins a new paragraph.

        Autoparagraphing, controlled by the .AP command, causes an impli
        command  each time either a blank line or a line beginning with
        encountered in the input text.  This is a  convenient  format  f
        entry, and allows easy modification.  By use of the .SP (SPacing
        commands, the same input text can be used for producing both dou
        triple) spaced drafts and single spaced final copy.

        Introduction               RNF


        Paragraphing is sufficiently flexible to be used for "hanging  i
        In  addition,  the  fact  that  paragraph  indentation  can be s
        relative to the left  margin  (even  if  it  is  later  changed)
        paragraphing to be conveniently used in indented text.



        1.7  PAGES


        Lines are automatically separated  into  pages  by  RNF.   Two
        control the size of RNF pages: .PS (Page Size) and .LINES.

        The first argument of .PS  specifies  the  number  of  lines  wh
        allowed  on  a page before an automatic page throw is done.  Thi
        includes the lines in the header at the top of each page, and th
        text  on the page, but does not include the lines in the footer
        at the bottom of the page.  The .LINES command specifies the  nu
        lines  on  the  entire  page.   This number is used when simulat
        ejects on terminals with continuous forms.

        The default .PS first argument and .LINES are 58 and  66,  respe
        This allows at least a 1 and 1/3 inch bottom margin with 6 line
        printing, and a 1 inch margin with line per inch  printing  on
        CSO reduced forms.

        Some terminals use reduced forms but print 6 lines per inch.  Th
        there are 51 lines on each page; a .PS first argument of 44 will
        1 inch bottom margin.



        1.7.1  Explicit paging control


        The  .PAGE  command  allows  the  user  to  advance  to  the  ne
        explicitly.   The .NMP and .PNO commands control page numbering,
        .TITLE, .ST, and .ATITLE commands provide for printing titles at
        of each page.



        1.7.2  Page Format


        A page is divided into three areas:

           . The top, which contains the upper margin and  optional  tit
             page number.

        6                          RNF                       Introductio


           . The middle, which contains the text of the document.

           . The bottom, which may contain a footer.  (By default, no fo
             printed.)


        The default header consists of an optional title on  the  left
        page  number  as an Arabic number on the right of the fourth lin
        page.  The subtitle, if any, is below the title on the  followin
        Two blank lines are left below the header.

        If this default format is not satisfactory for a specific docume
        user  may  substitute any arbitrary header and footer text by me
        .FRCPAGE macro  definition  (see  Chapter  3)  and  use  of  the
        intrinsics .TOP, .MID, and .BOT.

        The page number used  by  RNF  may  be  accessed  directly  thro
        predefined variable $$PAGE (see Chapter 4).

        Commands                   RNF







                                       CHAPTER 2

                                       COMMANDS




        Any sequence of non-blank characters beginning with a  period  (
        taken  by  RNF  to  be  a command.  If the command is not recogn
        error message is produced.

        Many commands require arguments, i.e., words which  follow  the
        and  modify  its  action  in some way.  The only commands which
        variable number of arguments are .TAB (or .TABS), .B, and  .S.
        other command requires an argument, it must be specified.

        Commands may be freely interspersed with text.  Some  commands
        "return"  (that  is, act as if they were preceded by a .CR comma
        part of their action.  If a command causes a return, this  is  i
        in parenthesis after the command format.  Other commands cause a
        (that is, act as if they were preceded by a .BR command) as  a
        their action.  These are indicated by (Break) in parenthesis.

        Note that a blank must follow a command if there is  more  text
        same  line.   For example, the sequence ".B.I 5" is in error; it
        written as ".B .I 5".


     .AP

         Any  blank  line  or any line beginning with a blank character
         new  paragraph.   See  the  .P  and  the  .PP  commands.   .NOA
         autoparagraphing off and is the default.


     .ARRAY variablename n

         This command declares an array variable with the name specified
         elements.  An element of the array is later accessed or  change
         reference of the form:

         variablename[expression]

         where  expression may be in the range 0 through n.  The zeroeth
         of the array may be  referred  to  without  a  [0]  subscript,
         commonly used as an index into the remainder of the array.

     .ATITLE

         Enables autotitling, which makes each new chapter heading the t
         all but the first page of the chapter.  The default is .NOATITL


     .AUTOCAP

         Enables  the auto capitalization, which makes the character fol

        Commands                   RNF


     .BAR

         Enables  change  bars.   All text following the .BAR command is
         right three spaces.  See the .BB and  .EB  commands.   The  def
         .NOBAR.


     .BB

         Begin  placing change bars (vertical bars) in the margin create
         .BAR command beginning with the line which contains the first
         the text following the .BB command.  See the .EB command.


     .BOT

         Sets  the  beginning  of  user text (on the page) to the curren
         line number and restores any output lines which might have  bee
         on a forced page eject (see .FRCPAGE).  If any deferred text is
         (see the .FIG command), as much of it as possible is  output  b
         If  as  is  mode  was in effect at the time of the last .FRCPAG
         restored.

         The  .BOT command is to be used only when overriding the defaul
         format via macros.

         The  .B and .S commands have no effect at the beginning of user
         a page.  This prevents spurious blank lines at the top of a tex


     .BR                                                          (Break

         Ends  the current outtput line and writes it without further fi
         justification.  No extra blank lines are left  by  .BR,  regard
         spacing.


     .C text                                                     (Return

     .DEBUG1

         Causes all following lines to be prefixed with the relative lin
         of the page.  This precedes the carriage control, if any.  .DEB
         includes  .DEBUG2.   .NODEBUG1  is  the  default.   This  is us
         finding problems when creating a document with many page ejects


     .DEBUG2

         Causes  all  following  lines to be trailed by the input line n
         the extreme right margin (not necesarily the margin set by .RM)
         is  very useful for document preparation, to correlate a proble

         Decrement the variablename.


     .DELMAC macroname

         Deletes the macro name, so that it may be reused.


     .DOT

         Causes  all  following  .T  or .RT commands to fill with dots (
         instead of spaces.  A blank is always left before and after the
         of dots.  .NODOTS returns to filling tabs with spaces.

     .ESC

         Enables the escape character _ (backarrow or underline).  When
         the escape character causes the character which follows it to b
         to  the  output text without special action.  For example, 23_.
         23. to be typed without an extra trailing blank.  The default i


     .F

         Fills  each  output  line with as many words from the input as
         without exceeding the right margin.  Blanks are removed from th
         Each  word of the output is followed by at least one blank, whi
         which end in ., !, or ? are followed by  at  least  two  blanks
         suppresses fill.


     .FIG n

         Reserves  n  lines  for a figure.  If the lines will fit on the
         page, .FIG causes a return and leaves n blank lines.  If not,
         lines are left at the beginning of the next page.


     .FLAG

         Causes  ^  and  @  to  be  recognized as flag characters.  .FLA
         default; .NOFLAG suppresses recognition.


     .FLAGCAPS

         Causes  the  <  character  to  invert the case of any letters i
         which  follow  it.   For  example,  <UP<AND<THEN<DOWN  is   out
         UPandTHENdown.   .NOFLAG suppresses special action for the < ch
         .FLAG is the default.


     .FLAGOVER

         The  .FLAGOVER  command  enables  recognition  of  \ (backslash
         strikeover character.  The strikeover character is written betw

     .FLAGSIG

         The   .FLAGSIG   command  enables  recognition  of  #  (sharp)
         significant blank character.   .FLAGSIG  is  the  default.   .N
         turns it off.


     .FRCPAGE

         This command is used internally by RNF to force a page eject.
         if a line is about to be written which would exceed the page si
         line is saved, and a .FRCPAGE command is executed as though it
         encountered in the input text.



         The .FRCPAGE command itself invokes the equivalent of .TOP, pri
         next page header, and invokes the equivalent of .MID.

         The user may add a footer or reformat the page  header  by  def
         macro  with the name .FRCPAGE.  This replaces the .FRCPAGE comm

         .FRCPAGE macro must be either .BOT or .TOP, and the last word s
         .MID.

         Note that .FRCPAGE does not return, nor can  it,  since  a  ret
         cause  a  page  eject,  which  will  cause  a  .FRCPAGE  to  be
         recursively.  The .PAGE command does return, and in fact is def
         .BR .FRCPAGE.


     .FMT n1 n2

         Formats  the  value of n2 according to the format code specifie
         N1 and n2 may be expressions (see Chapter 4).  N1 must be in th

                                        MACROS



        User-defined RNF macros provide a means of:

           . Extending the set of RNF commands by adding macros  tailore
             specific application.

           . Abbreviating commonly used series of RNF commands.

           . Abbreviating commonly used phrases or long words.

        For  example,  the  following macro definitions were used to pro
        dotted list above:

                 .MACRO BDOT = .SAV .P -2 1 5 .LM +5
                 .MACRO DOT = .PP _.# .X
                 .MACRO EDOT = .RES .S 1

        while the following two macros  were  used  to  format  the  abo
        following) examples:

                 .MACRO EX = .SAV .LM +9 .NOF .NOJ .S 1
                 .MACRO EEX = .RES .S 1

        and so on!

        The following discussion is intended to give the user some insig
        potential  uses  of  macros  while  demonstrating how easy macro
        define and use.



        3.1  WHAT MACROS ARE


        Macros have two parts: a name, and some text.  The name is a sin
        long, while the text may be zero or more words long.

        The effect of a macro is similiarly easy to describe: wherever t
        of the macro appears RNF removes it and substitutes the text.

        Macros                     RNF                                 2


        For example, if the following macro is defined:

                 .MACRO CDC = Control Data Corporation

        whenever .CDC appears in the  input,  RNF  removes  it  and  sub
        Control Data Corporation.


                                     Note the Dots

                       The   macro  name  is  defined  without  a
                       preceding  period  (dot).   But  when  the
                       macro  is  used, the name must be preceded
                       by a dot.





        3.2  HOW TO DEFINE A MACRO


        The simplest form of macro definition is:

                 .MACRO name = text

        where name is the name of the macro, and text represents all the
        the rest of the same line.

        After the macro definition, wherever .name appears RNF  removes
        substitutes the text.



        3.3  SUB-MACROS


        All macro expansions are considered to take place on the same in
        as  the  "outermost" macro call.  Thus, macros can be parameteri
        simple way by ending a macro expansion with a  command  and  typ
        command argument(s) after the macro call.  For example,

                 .MACRO RIGHTMARG = .RM

        which could be used by

                 .RIGHTMARG 65

        But,  as  the  example shows, this approach is mostly limited to
        command replacements.  Sub-macros provide the  ability  to  para
        macros in a more useful fashion.

        3.3.1  Defining Parameterized Macros


        Macros with sub-macros are defined by the formats:

                 .MACRO name n = text
                 -or-
                 .MACRO name * = text

        The n in the format stands for a number in the range 1  through
        means  that  the  1 through 7 words following the macro call on
        line are dynamically made the values of the sub-macros name1, na
        ,name7.

        Sub-macros have a defined value only when the macro is being exp

        If an asterisk is used instead of a number n,  it  means  that
        words  which follow the macro call on the same line are dynamica
        the value of the sub-macro name1.

        For example,

                 .MACRO Z 2 = I hope you are .Z1 .X ing .Z2 .X !

        When .Z is called, the sub-macros .Z1 and .Z2 are given values e
        the two words which follow .Z on the same line.  Thus, the call

                 .Z follow me

        produces the text

                 I hope you are following me!




        3.3.2  Sub-macro Semantics

        Since the parameters of a macro are defined as macros  themselve
        may  be  used  in any macro called while the sub-macros are defi
        need not be "passed down" from macro to macro.

        If no words or not  enough  words  follow  the  call  of  a  mac
        sub-macros, the sub-macros are given null values.  That is, unle
        is actually a word corresponding to a sub-macro, it expands  to
        at all.

                                       VARIABLES




        RNF allows the user to define and  use  numeric  variables.   Th
        handy  (and  are  used  internally)  for  keeping track of page
        chapter numbers, header levels, etc.



        4.1  VARIABLE SYNTAX


        Variables are words which begin with a dollar sign ($), followed
        1 to 9 letters, numbers, or $ characters.  The case of variable
        not significant, e.g., $HILO and $hilo are the same variable.

        The first character after the leading $ cannot be a number.  Thi
        character  combinations  of  the  forms  $<blank> and $<numbers>
        recognized as variables, making a nuisance for the user.

        Users should not declare variables with two  leading  dollar  si
        this is the format used by pre-declared RNF system variables.

        For example, the following are valid variable names:

                 $A

                 $VARIABLE

                 $n$

                 $L23

        while the following are invalid:


                 $100

                 $

        4.2  HOW TO DECLARE VARIABLES


        Variables are declared by the .VAR command, which has the format

                 .VAR $name

        Note that the variable name is both declared and used with a lea

        The effect of .VAR is to allocate space for a numeric variable,
        the name specified, and initialize the variable to zero.

        RNF provides  75  spaces  for  user-defined  variables  in  addi
        predefined variables.



        4.3  PREDEFINED VARIABLES


        As a convenience to the  user,  Rnf  makes  use  of  several  pr
        variables  while  performing various commands.  The predefined v
        are:

             $$PAGE Current page number.
             $$CH Current chapter number.
             $$HL Current  header  level.   Also  defined  are  $$HL[1]
                         $$HL[5],  which  contain  the  current  counts
                         level.
             $$LIST Current list level.   Also  defined  are  $$LIST[1]
                         $$LIST[10],  which  contain  the current counts
                         level.
             $$LM Current left margin, set by .LM.
             $$RM Current right margin, set by .RM.
             $$SP Current spacing, set by .SP.
             $$NMP Page numbering flag, set by .NMP.

        The values of the predefined variables may be examined or change
        user  at  any  time.   (Of course, changing these values will af
        operation of the built in RNF features which use them.)



        4.4  VARIABLE ARRAYS


        Arrays may be declared by the .ARRAY command, which has the form

                 .ARRAY $name n

        The effect of this declaration is that $name is declared to  be
        element array, which may be referenced as $name[0] through $name

        The subscript may be omitted if the zeroeth  element  of  the  a

        convention is adopted so that a single declaration can allocate
        n-element  array  and an index variable associated with the arra
        predeclared arrays $$HL and $$LIST are used in this fashion.)

        Note that the array declaration requires n+1 spaces of the  allo
        user variables.



        4.5  EXPRESSIONS


        An extremely useful feature of RNF is the ability to combine  va
        numbers,  and  operators into expressions which compute a numeri
        The values computed by the expressions can  in  turn  index  arr
        assigned to variables, or become a part of the output text.



        4.5.1  Expression Syntax


        An expression is defined as follows:

                 expr      ::= term < relop term >

                 relop     ::= .EQ. × .NE. × .LT. × .LE. × .GT. × .GE.

                 term      ::= item < < + × - > item >...

                 item      ::= < + × - × # > element

                 element   ::= ( term) × var × integer

                 var       ::= $id < [ term ] > < = term >


        The angle brackets < and > in the syntax  expressions  enclose
        parts.  The construction

                 < stuff >...


        indicates that stuff is allowed to appear zero or more times.  N
        angle  brackets  are used to describe expressions; they do not a
        expressions.

        The # character in an expression represents  a  logical  NOT  op
        The  expression  #x  has  the value 1 if x equals , otherwise it
        value 0.

        26                         RNF                          Variable


        The blanks in the syntax expressions are not  significant  and
        blanks  are  not permitted in expressions.  That is, and express
        be a single word.

        Some examples of valid expressions are:

                 $A.GR.5

                 $HL[$HL+1]=0

                 2+$$PAGE

                 $X[$X=$X+1]=$X[$X]+1

                 $A=$B=$C




        4.5.2  Expression Evaluation


        Expressions are evaluated from left to right,  except  that  ass
        (indicated by the = sign) at the same level are done from right

        In the examples above, $X[$X=$X+1]=$X[$X]+1 is equivalent to the
        of  expressions  $X=$X+1  $X[$X]=$X[$X]+1.   (Recall  that  the
        element of an array can be referenced without subscripts.)  On t
        hand, the expression $A=$B=$C is equivalent to $B=$C $A=$B.



        4.5.3  Where Expressions Are Used


        An expression can always be used as  an  argument  to  a  comman
        requires a numeric value.

        An expression can also appear in text.  RNF decides whether to
        an  expression  in text or not based on whether the first charac
        $.  If it is, RNF evaluates the expression; otherwise the expres
        treated like any other text word.

        For example, the expression $A+2 will be evaluated, while 2+$A w
        If  $A  has  the  value  3, the former will appear in the output
        while the latter will appear as "2+$A".

        For the few cases when it is not convenient to begin an expressi
        evaluated with a variable name, the syntax:

                 $(expr)

        Variables                  RNF                                 2


        will cause expr to be evaluated.



        4.5.4  Suppressed Expressions


        Frequently, one wishes to compute a value and assign it to a var
        that  is,  evaluate  an expression -- without placing anything a
        the output text.  This is done by  terminating  the  expression
        semicolon.

        For example, the words:


                          .VAR $A See $A=$A+1; only $A of these.

                 are output as

                                      Input Text

        Input text to RNO consists of a sequence of words and commands s
        by blanks.  A command is any word which begins with a period fol
        a non-digit, while a word is any sequence of characters which  d
        contain a blank.  The following are considered words:

     This
     .B
     WORD#WITH#SIGNIFICANT#BLANKS
     .234

        Of the above words, only .B is a command.

        RNO  gathers  words  into  lines.   By default, the first word i
        begins at the left margin, and the last word ends at or before t
        margin.  That is, lines are left justified.

        In the output, at least one blank  appears  between  words;  two
        follow a period or question mark which end a word.

        5.3.1  HOW TO USE HEADER LEVELS


        The .HL command enables the typist to organize text into  sectio
        sections  within  sections, with sequential numbers which are ch
        the computer if sections are added or deleted.



        5.3.1.1  Format


        The format of the .HL command is:

         .HL number text

        The number is the level number, where 1 is the outermost level,
        next inner level, etc.  The text is the title of the section.



        5.3.1.2  Effect of the Command


        The .HL command starts a section at the level specified and uses
        the  header.   The  number can be in the range from 1 to 5.  The
        number output is in the form i.j.k.l.m.   If  the  document  is
        oriented,  i  is the chapter number; otherwise it is the number
        commands since the beginning of the input text.

        The command does a return, a test  page  9,  and  precedes  the
        identifier  with  3  blank lines.  The margins and other environ
        reset to the values they had  before  the  first  .HL  command
        chapter).  The section number begins at the left margin, followe
        spaces, followed by the text, if any.

        A single blank line is inserted after the header.



        5.3.2  INCREMENTING


        Section numbers are incremented by 1 at the level  of  the  curr
        command.

        Each time levels are nested (for example, .HL 1 followed by .HL
        numbering is restarted at 1 for the higher numbered level.

                                      Using Lists

        Automatically numbered lists can be generated by  the  .LIST,  .
        .ELIST commands.  The .LIST command has the format:

         .LIST spacing

        where spacing is a number in the range 1 through 5 which  specif
        spacing to be used within the list.

        The list is generated as follows:

             1.  Each list element is preceded by the .LE command.

             2.  List elements are separated by "spacing" blank lines.

             3.  Each element is automatically numbered beginning at by

             4.  The list is terminated by the .ELIST command (which als
                 the margins and spacing).

             5.  Lists can be nested within lists.  This is handled as f

                 1.  The  left  margin  is  set  9  columns to the right
                     outermost list, and 4 columns to the right for  eac
                     list.

                 2.  Each .LIST must be terminated by a  matching  .ELIS
                     .ELIST  resets  the margins and spacing as they wer
                     the .LIST command.

                 3.  For  users of autoparagraphing, the paragraph margi
                     to coincide with the left margin, and paragraph spa
                     set to the list spacing plus 1.


                     This means that autoparagraphing can be  convenient
                     at any list level.


                     The paragraph values are reset by the .ELIST comman

             6.  Lists can be nested up to 5 levels.

        The list facility can be a significant convenience for the typis

 ×         version of a document, and are commonly found only in technic
 ×         where the reader must be alterted to new features.

           The .BAR command enables change bars, and has the  immediate

           disables change bars.  Usually, the command appears before an
           document, so the left margin in the output is uniform.

        5.6  TAB EXAMPLES

        .ASCII
        .c Using <rno Tabs
        .ap
         <rno tab stops are set by the <.tabs command.  The format is:
         .i 9 <.tabs c1 c2 <... c15
         where c1 through c15 are character positions, in ascending orde
        where the tab stops are to be set.
        (Character positions are numbered beginning at 1). To work
        correctly, tab stops must not be set beyond the right margin.
         Tabs are used by the <.t command, which means "begin the next
        word at the next tab stop".
         For example, the following
         .i 9 <.tabs 10 20 30 40
        .br .i 9 Line <.t this <.t up <.t in <.t columns
         produces
        .tabs 19 29 39 49
         .i 9 Line .t this .t up .t in .t columns
         The following features should be noted:
        .tab 30 .p -21 2 5 .lm 30
         Justification .t Having tabs in a line does not suppress
        justification.  Only the text after the last tab in a line is bl
        padded.  This permits convenient use of "hanging" titles and
        indentation.
         Left/Right .t Tabs produced by <.t cause the following
        word to begin at the next tab stop.  The <.rt
        command causes the following word to end at the
        next tab stop.  This permits creating tables of numeric
        data.

                                    Using RNO Tabs

        RNO tab stops are set by the .TABS command.  The format is:

         .TABS c1 c2 ...  c15

        where c1 through c15 are character positions, in ascending order
        the  tab  stops  are  to  be  set.   (Character  positions  are
        beginning at 1).  To work correctly, tab stops must not  be  set
        the right margin.

        Tabs are used by the .T command, which means "begin the next wor
        next tab stop".

        For example, the following

         .TABS 10 20 30 40
         Line .T this .T up .T in .T columns

        produces

         Line      this      up        in        columns

        The following features should be noted:

         Justification        Having  tabs  in  a   line   does   not
                              justification.   Only  the text after the
                              in  a  line  is  blank   padded.    This
                              convenient    use    of   "hanging"   titl
                              indentation.

         Left/Right           Tabs produced by .T cause the  following
                              begin  at  the  next  tab  stop.   The .RT
                              causes the following word to end at the  n
                              stop.   This  permits  creating  tables of
                              data.

                                    HOW TO RUN RNF



        This is implementation dependent information!

        The following jcl may be used to run RNF:

        //RNF EXEC PGM=RUNOFF,REGION=90K,PARM='/IOBUF=16K',TIME=(2,00)
        //OUTPUT DD SYSOUT=(G,,0721),DCB=(LRECL=133,BLKSIZE=133,RECFM=FB
        //QRR DD SYSOUT=A,DCB=(LRECL=90,BLKSIZE=90,RECFM=FB)
        //INPUT DD *
           runoff text
        /*


        NOTES:

        If  you  do not wish to see the input printed, specify DUMMY, in
        SYSOUT=A on the QRR DD card.

        Adjust  REGION=90K  if BLKSIZE parameters are too large, but thi
        be sufficient for the normal case.

        Be sure to specify the proper OUTPUT DD sysout class and form.

        Be sure to specify the correct library in the //STEPLIB or  //JO
        card.
