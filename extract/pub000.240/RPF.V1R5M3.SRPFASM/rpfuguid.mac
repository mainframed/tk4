:h2.Introduction.
:p.
RPF is a command processor under TSO, developed by Rob Prins
member of the systems programming department of the ING
Bank in Amsterdam. For program development the ING Bank used ROSCOE,
but when the systems programming group started using TSO for
maintenance, the need arose for a full-screen editor under TSO. at
this point Rob decided to develop their own editor, not only
because they needed an editor, but also for learning the internals of
TSO. This resulted in the 'RPF' package. It is not only an editor,
but it also includes functions like PDS maintenance (SCRATCH, RENAME
EDIT, PRINT, BROWSE and assigning ALIAS), foreground assembly and
binding, VTOC and catalog listing, dataset allocation and
deletion and even
a LIBRARIAN and PANVALET interface to read and write modules on a disk
master file and a TSO command processor to execute TSO commands in
RPF.  The main advantage of an inhouse developed package is, that the
source is available, so that it can be tailored to the demands of the
user. As the package became available to the users (the systems
programmers) they very soon stopped using ROSCOE for program
development, which indicated that it is a very useful product.  RPF
is using the MVS operation system.

:h2.How to start RPF.
:p.
RPF is a TSO command processor for full screen data editing and
utility functions.
RPF can be activated by entering the command 'RPF' on
your TSO terminal.
:h3.How to work with RPF.
:p.
If you start RPF a database record with defaults for your userid
will be read. If the record is not present, that record will be
created by RPF.
.br
If you enter the TSO command 'RPF FAST' the database will
not be included. RPF will choose his own defaults.
The main advantage of 'RPF FAST' is that RPF will start very
quick, but the database will not be searched.
:p.
After RPF has started, the following main menu appears on the screen
:p.

Figure 1. RPF main menu
:h2 id=def. Change session defaults.
:p.
The session defaults are placed in a VSAM database.
The name of the VSAM database is specified in the first record of
member 'RPFKEY00' in the SYS1.PARMLIB
:p.
You can change the following defaults in the database:
:p.
:ol.
:li.The maximum amount of lines for the editor The minimum is 50
lines and the maximum is 59,999 lines.  Default is 1,000 lines.
:li.Sysoutclass. The default is sysoutclass C. sysoutclass will
be used in the print commands of RPF.
:li.Logging YES or NO. This default is for future use.
:li.Nulls YES or NO. This default will set the RPF
editor in NULLS mode or NONULLS mode.
:li.AUTOSAVE Y or N. With this default the workspace will
be saved automaticly if Y or EDIT will give msg 'Enter SAVE or CANCEL'
if N.
:li.SUBMIT=TSO or RPF. With SUBMIT=TSO, the TSO command SUBMIT will be
invoked if using the SUBMIT command in EDIT. With SUBMIT=RPF, the job
will be directly submitted to the JES2 internal reader.
:li.
Replace = YES or NO. The parameter defaults the Replace like members
in Move/Copy.
:li.
Default prefix. This is a field of maximum 17 bytes containing the
default prefix in the dataset list menu (opt. 3.4).
:li.
The default program name of the assembler. This name is used in the
assembler menu (option 4).
:li.Uppercase=YES or NO. Default for uppercase or lowercase
editing. default is UPPERCASE=YES.
:li.Append YES or NO: EDIT dataset or PDS member after another
dataset or member yes or no. default is append=no
:li.YES or NO: EDIT a dataset with line numbers or
not. Default is LINE NUMBERS=YES.
:li.Default allocations.
This is the default dataset or PDS member to be
allocated for edit, foreground assembly, BROWSE
and PDS functions.
The LIBRARIAN master file, LIBRARIAN module and
volume on which the LIBRARIAN master file
resides are in this menu too.
You can also change the PANVALET module, dataset
and volume in this screen
You can always change the allocation
when you select these functions.
:li.Printer. Specify the remote printer. If nothing
specified, the output will be routed to a LOCAL printer.
:li.PFK settings:   You can set the commands in the PFKs (1 to 24)
The use of all PFKs are supported in EDIT, BROWSE
PDS maintenance, LIBRARIAN maintenance and HELP
functions.
The use of the END PFK (PFK03 or PFK15) is
supported in all selection menus.
Meaning of the 'CON' attribute:
CON=Y: The command in the PFK will set in the
command area on the screen, but will not be
executed.
To execute the command you should press ENTER
CON=N: The command will be executed
immediately.
CON=X: The PFK has gotten the 'UNDEFINED' status.
:li.Assembler maclibs. Specify up to 6 maclibs.
:li.Assembler parm. This is the default assembler parm in the
foreground assembly.
:li.linkage editor parm. This is the default linkage editor parm in the
foreground assembly.
:li.linkage editor control statements. 6 optional statements used by
the linkage editor.
:eol.
:p.
All the changed defaults will be written on the VSAM RPF database
if present.
.br
If you select -0- on the main menu the default menu appears on the
screen:
:p.
With selection -0- you can list the status of your RPF session.
In this screen the date and time, session duration, EDIT options,
default options, current allocation, workspace size and lines of
the workspace in use are to be displayed.
Press ENTER to leave this status screen.
:p.
With -1- you can change the workspace size, the logging,
the sysoutclass, Autosave, Submit, Replace, default prefix, assembler
program, append and line numbers.
To change these defaults press ENTER after the changes made.
To cancel the changes, use PFK03/15.
:p.
With -2- you can change the uppercase, append, line numbers and
default allocations and LIBRARIAN allocations
To change these defaults press ENTER after the changes made.
To cancel the changes, use PFK03/15.
:p.
With -3- you can change your PFK settings.
:p.
With -4- you can update the assembler maclibs, assembler and
linkage editor
parameters and the default linkage editor control statements.
To leave the default menus enter an 'X' or press PFK03/15
:p.
It is also possible to select the default functions directly from
the RPF main menu, without interference of the defaults menu (e.g.
select '0.1' for increase workspace). If the function is terminated
in this case, RPF always returns to the main menu.
:h2 id=brw. BROWSE source data and output listings.
:p.
If you select -1- on the RPF main menu, an allocation panel will
be displayed for selection of the to be browsed dataset.
You can select the datasets in two ways:
:ul c.
:li.Select the member/dataset (and volume) in the allocation menu
:li.Select 1 of the datasets in the dataset selection menu, by
entering a non-blank character in the selection field and specifying
a dataset (and volume) if not already listed.
:eul.
After selection of this dataset, the BROWSE function will be invoked.
and the dataset (and volume) will be placed in selection list.
This selection list will be written in the RPF database, if you leave
RPF.
:p.
If the member is not specified, a member selection list has
been displayed.
If you select an 'S' in front of the chosen member, The browse
processor
will be invoked. See also :hdref refid=pdsm for information about
The 'S' line command.
:p.
The following RPF Browse commands are available:
:dl tsize=18
:dthd.Subcommand
:ddhd.Function
:dt.BOTTOM
:dd.Start display with the bottom of the dataset.
This command may be abbreviated as 'B'
:dt.C nnn
:dd.Shift the display to column nnn.
nnn should not exceed the record length of the dataset.
:dt.END
:dd.Terminate BROWSE. RPF will go back to the utility allocation menu.
:dt.F 'string'
:dd.search specified character string. All lines, which
contains 'string' will be highlighted and the
message 'CHARS string FOUND' will appear.
If only an 'F' is entered, a repeat find of the
previous specified string will be done.
The find always start from the current position in
the dataset. If no match can be found, the message
'TEXT NOT FOUND' will appear.
The quotes (') around 'string' can be omitted, if
no blanks are inside the string.
:dt.L xxxx
:dd.Locate at label xxxx. This label should be
previously assigned with the 'LABEL' subcommand
:dt.LABEL xxxx
:dd.Assign label xxxx on this page of the
dataset. The user will be notified.
:dt.PFK
:dd.Display PFK screen and alter PFKs if you
wish. These PFK changes are only effective
during this RPF session.
To change the PFK-s permanent use the defaults menu.
:dt.PRINT x
:dd.Print the dataset into sysoutclass x.
If you omit the sysoutclass, the default sysoutclass will be taken.
:dt.RETURN
:dd.Terminate BROWSE. RPF will go back immediately to the main menu.
:dt.=n or =n.n
:dd.Terminate BROWSE. RPF will go back to MAIN and option 'n' or
'n.n' will be executed
:dt.SCB
:dd.Scroll 1 screen backward in the dataset.
If you use SCB with a PFK and an 'M' in the
command field the 'TOP' command will be executed.
:dt.SCF
:dd.Scroll 1 screen forward in the dataset.
If you use SCF with a PFK and an 'M' in the
command field the 'BOTTOM' command will be executed.
:dt.SCL
:dd.Scroll 1 screen to the left in the dataset.
:dt.SCR
:dd.Scroll 1 screen to the right in the dataset.
:dt.SUB(MIT)
:dd.Submit the dataset to the JES2 internal reader.
:dt.TOP
:dd.Start display with the top of the dataset.
This command may be abbreviated as 'T'
:edl.
:lblbox.Notes
:ul.
:li.All these commands can be set under a PFK.
So you can use the PFKs instead of entering the commands
on the screen
:li.If you print the dataset with the 'PRINT' command
RPF will make header lines if the dataset does not
contain ASA or machine control characters.
If the to be browsed input dataset is a card image dataset
(LRECL=80 and no control characters), a scale line will be
printed after the header lines and after each record, the
start column of the first non-blank character of that line
will be printed.
If the control characters are present RPF does not
make headers.
:li.The maximum number of lines, which can be browsed is 2048 screen
pages. That is 21*2048 lines for a 3270 model 2 screen, 29*2048 lines
for a model 3, 40*2048 lines for a model 4 and 24*2048 lines for
a model 5 screen.
:eul.
:elblbox.
:h2 id=edit. EDIT a dataset or PDS member.
:p.
If you select option '2' on the RPF main menu, the EDIT function
will be performed.
.br
The EDIT entry screen contains of four parts;
:ol.
:li.The menu.
In this menu you can select option '1' for EDIT of OS datasets,
like a PDS or sequential card-image dataset. Use part 3 or part 4 of
the entry screen to EDIT the right dataset.
If you select option '2', EDIT will be done from a LIBRARIAN
master file via a LIBRARIAN read menu.
(see :hdref refid=libe )
option '3' performs EDIT from a PANVALET library.
(see :hdref refid=pane )
:li.The options panel.
In this part of the screen you can select UPPERCASE=YES or NO,
APPEND=YES or NO for appending data at the end of the workspace
and NUMBERED=YES or NO for numbered or nonum data.
:li.The allocation panel.
In this part of the screen you are able to perform the allocation
of the OS dataset to be edited (Option 1 in the selection menu).
If the allocations are alright, the dataset or PDS member will
be edited and the EDIT screen appears, otherwise the user will be
prompted for retry.
:li.The dataset selection list.
:eol.
You can select the datasets in two ways:
:ul c.
:li.Select the member/dataset (and volume) in the allocation menu
:li.Select 1 of the datasets in the dataset selection menu, by
entering a non-blank character in the selection field and specifying
a dataset (and volume) if not already listed.
:eul.
After selection of this dataset, the Edit function will be invoked.
and the dataset (and volume) will be placed in selection list.
This selection list will be written in the RPF database, if you leave
RPF.
If you want to cancel the function, press PFK03 or PFK15.
:p.
If the member is not specified, a member selection list has
been displayed.
If you select an 'S' in front of the chosen member, The editor
will be invoked. See also :hdref refid=pdsm for information about
The 'S' line command.
:p.
If the member does not exist, an input screen will be made with 1
screen blank lines and in de header line will appear 'CREATE mmmmmmm'.
If the dataset is edited you can change your data in fullscreen mode.
The screen is divided into 5 parts:
:ul c.
:li.The header, containing  the fields 'TRUNC', 'XLATE',
'TOP', 'BOTTOM', 'NONUM', 'NULLS' and 'ASIS'. These fields will be
highlighted if in effect.
:li.The message area for the informational and error messages
:li.The scope field with the editor boundaries.
:li.The scroll amount.
:li.The data area, containing the data to be edited.
:eul.
The editor can be entered in standard or in COBOL mode.
In the standard mode colums 1-72 will be displayed or cols 9-80
if the 'SCR' subcommand has been given. The linenumbers if present
or created by the 'RENUM' subcommand will affect cols 73-80.
In the COBOL mode columns 9-78 will be displayed. The linenumbers if
present or created by the 'RENUM' command will affect cols 1-6.
If in COBOL mode the editor will display 'COBOL' in the scale line.
If the suffix of the be edited dataset is 'COBOL', COBOL mode
will be selected.
.sp
Both modes can be entered as 'NUM' or as 'NONUM'
In 'NUM' mode columns 73-80 or columns 1-6 of the dataset ar numbered.
In 'NONUM' mode the dataset is not line-numbered.
In 'NONUM' mode the field 'NONUM' in the header line will be
highlighted.
.br
In both cases, you can work with line-numbers in the subcommands,
because the numbers on the screen are NOT in the dataset
.br
If a dataset does not contain line numbers and 'LINENUMBERS=YES' is
selected, the editor will be entered in 'NONUM' mode.
If you select UPPERCASE=NO the typed in characters will not be
translated to capitals. That is very handy if you do text processing
with RPF.
.br
If you select UPPERCASE=NO, the 'ASIS' field in the header line
will be highlighted.
If you do program development always select UPPERCASE=YES.
.br
If the suffix of the to be edited dataset is 'TEXT'
'ASIS' will always be selected.
RPF will test the dataset to be edited, if lower case characters
are detected, 'ASIS' will always be selected.
The subcommands in EDIT can be entered as 'command' or '&command'.
If the ampersand if present before the command, the command will
be repeated after execution.
.br
If you have entered a wrong command or invalid command the command
will be repeated too, so you can make easy your corrections.
:p.There are two kinds of commands:
.br
The primary commands entered in the 'command' field
(see :hdref refid=eprim )
.br
Line commands entered in the linenumber fields
(see :hdref refid=eline )
:h3 id=eprim. EDIT primary commands.
:p.
The EDIT primary commands are described in alphabetic order below:
:dl tsize=18
:dthd.Subcommand
:ddhd.Function
:dt.&
:dd.If the '&' (ampersand) is entered, the previous
command will be set in the command area of the EDIT screen
:dt.ASIS
:dd.Set the editor dynamically in 'UPPERCASE=NO'
mode (similar to 'UPPERCASE=NO' in the allocation menu)
:dt.BOTTOM
:dd.Display last screen of the dataset.
'BOTTOM' will be highlighted in the header line of the EDIT screen
This command may be abbreviated as 'B'
:dt.C /aaa/bbb/(A)
:dd.With this command, you can change character strings
throughout your entire workspace.
If you do not specify the 'A' after the last
delimiter, only the first line on the screen will
be changed, otherwise the first line till the end
of the workspace will be changed.
If you enter 'C /string//(A)' the character string
will be deleted.
With 'C //string/(A)' the character string will be
inserted before the first character of the line,
or all lines if 'A' is specified.
The delimiter can be any character.
Only character strings will be changed, which are
in the column-range, that is set by the 'SCOPE' command.
:dt.C /aa/bb/n,m
:dd.With this form of the 'C' subcommand you can make
changes in a specified line range (n,m). both
numbers should be specified. If you want to
change 1 line use first the 'L nnnn' command
and after this command 'C /aaa/bbb/'.
If n = '*' change will be done beginning with the
current line.
In this case the second number should be after the current line.
:dt.CANCEL
:dd.Terminate the RPF EDIT function, without saving
the workspace. This command may be abbreviated as 'CAN'
:dt.CAPS
:dd.Set the editor dynamically in 'UPPERCASE=YES'
mode (similar to 'UPPERCASE=YES' in the allocation menu).
:dt.CANCEL
:dd.Terminate the RPF EDIT function, without saving
the workspace. This command may be abbreviated as 'CAN'
:dt.CO n,m,o
:dd.Copy linerange n till m after line o.
If you specify n=* the current line till line m will be copied.
If 'o' is omitted line n will be copied after line m.
If the CO command cannot be executed, a suitable
error message will be displayed.
After successful copy the workspace will be renumbered.
:dt.COB
:dd.Set the editor from standard in COBOL mode.
If in COBOL mode the 'SCL' and 'SCR' subcommands
are not applicable.
If the editor was in 'NUM' mode before the 'COB'
command was given, RPFEDIT will do a numeric test
for columns 01-06 of the workspace. If not numeric
RPFEDIT will come into the 'NONUM' mode after the 'COB' subcommand.
:dt.CUT
:dd.Copy lines between CC (See :hdref refid=eline ), first line to CT
or CB to last line to the clipboard file.
The clipboard file is allocated with ddname RPFCTPST.
The contents of the clipboard file can be pasted in any member or
dataset in the current RPF session. The clipboard will be deleted
upon end of the RPF session.
:dt.COPY
:dd.Append another dataset or member in the EDIT workspace.
After entering 'COPY', the dataset menu will
appear with default 'APPEND=YES'. Alter the
allocations and press ENTER to append.
With the END subcommand the data will be saved in the dataset/member
which is initially edited.
:dt.DEL n,m
:dd.Delete lines n till m or delete line n if m is omitted.
:dt.DEL *,n
:dd.Delete n lines starting with the first line on the screen.
If n is omitted only the first line on the screen
has been deleted.
:dt.END
:dd.Terminate the RPF EDIT function and save the data if changes are
made. No menu will be presented. The data will be saved in the
same dataset/member, if AUTOSAVE=Y.
RPF will return to the EDIT allocation menu.
If AUTOSAVE=N, the message 'Enter SAVE or CANCEL' will be issued and
EDIT will not be terminated.
:dt.FIND 'String',n,m or FIND "String",n,m
:dd.Find a specified character string in the workspace.
If the character string is found, that line will
be the first line on the screen.
If linerange n,m is specified, the find will only
be done in that range.
If the find is unsuccessful a suitable error
message will be displayed and the command will be repeated.
The delimiter (the quote or double quote) is optional, unless 'string'
contains blanks or line numbers "n,m" are present in the command.
The character string will be remembered by RPF,
so you can enter only an 'F' to execute the last FIND command.
Only character strings will be found, which are
in the column-range, that is set by the 'SCOPE' subcommand.
.br;An alias of FIND is F.
:dt.FILL /string/
:dd.With this command you set a character string in
each line starting with the current line till
the end of the workspace.
The character string will start in the column,
which is set by the 'SCOPE' command.
The data, which was there will be overwritten.
:dt.FILL /str/n,m
:dd.This FILL command will only affect the line range n,m
:dt.HAR xxxxxx,n,m
:dd.Print the lines n till m on printer with
name xxxxxx. If n and m are omitted the lines
on the current screen will be printed.
The printer will be aquired during this command
after successful hardcopy the message
'HARDCOPY MADE' will appear.
:dt.HAR xxxxxx,*,n
:dd.Print n lines on printer xxxxxxx starting with
the first line on the screen.
If n=99999999 the current line till the end of
the workspace will be printed
:dt.HAR xxx,n,m, TITLE/NOTITLE, EJECT/NOEJECT, INDENT/NOINDENT,
C=nn,P=nn, F='text', SCS,DSC
:dd.With 'EJECT' you can skip after every 'nn' lines
(nn is value in the 'P' operand). 'EJECT' is default.
.br
With 'TITLE', you can print headers on each page
default is 'NOTITLE'.
.br
With 'c=nn' you can print 'nn' copies (default 1).
.br
With the keyword 'INDENT' the print will be
shifted 8 positions to the right.
Default is 'NOINDENT'.
.br
The printername and linenumbers are positional
parameters, the rest are keywords.
.br
With F='text' a footnote will be printed at
the bottom of each page. 'text' has a maximum
length of 80 and should be specified between
apostrophes.
.br
'SCS' (lutype1) or 'DSC' (lutype 0 or 3) should
be specified if the printer is cross domain used.
:dt.HELP
:dd.Invoke the RPF HELP facility.
.br
See :hdref refid=help for more information concerning HELP
:dt.I m,n
:dd.Insert n blank lines after line m or insert n lines
after the first line on the screen (specify m=*).
If n is omitted 1 line will be inserted after line
m or current line if m=*.
After a successful insertion the workspace will be
renumbered and the cursor will be set in the first inserted line.
.br
The linenumbers of the inserted lines will be highlighted, until
data is entered in an inserted line. You do not need to delete
unused lines. The highlighted lines (the inserted lines without data)
will not be saved (with the END or SAVE subcommand) or submitted
(with the SUBMIT subcommand). This is the way like VM XEDIT it does.
:dt.L +nnn/L -nnn
:dd.Skip :hp2.nnn:ehp2. lines foreward or backward.
If you are at the top of the screen

.br
If n,m is specified, the omit will only be done
in line range n-m. See the "F" command for the right syntax
:dt.OSSAVE
:dd.If the editor has been invoked from LIBRARIAN maintenance,
the SAVE function will be performed upon a librarian master file.
Use OSSAVE if you want to save upon a PDS or sequential

member edited, the user will be prompted to replace
the member or enter a 'newname', except if option
'2' has been selected (SAVE RE-USE).
If you select option '3' on the SAVE menu,
the rest of the parameters are ignored and RPF
will select the LIBRARIAN menu (see :hdref refid=libu )
.br
Option '4' will perform saving upon a PANVALET library.
See :hdref refid=panu
If the workspace is saved into a PDS member, RPF
will update the statistics in the directory or
add statistics if the statistics are not already present.

:dt.SCB
:dd.Scroll backward depending of the scroll value on
the screen. The scroll value is described in the SCF command.
.br
If 'M' is entered in the command field and the
'SCB' command is given by means of a PFK the
'TOP' command will be executed.
.br
If you enter 'nnnnn' (max 5 positions 0-9) and the SCB command has
been given by means of a PFK,
'nnnnn' lines will be scrolled backward.
:dt.SCF
:dd.With this command you can scroll foreward.
.br
The scroll value is specified in the screen,
which can be: 'PAGE' for a complete screen,
'CSR' for scroll on cursor position (if scroll
foreward, line on which the cursor is located,
becomes the first line. If scroll backward, line
on which the cursor is located, becomes the last
line. If the cursor is in the command field,
the number of lines on the screen minus 1 will be scrolled).
'HALF' for a half screen or 'LINE' for a
single line. If you want to change this value
you can alter this first character in this field
('C', 'H', 'P' or 'L')

:dt.SCOPE n,m
:dd.With this command you can set the range of columns
which will be used in 'C', 'F', 'FILL', 'O', 'UC'
'LC' and 'SORT' subcommands.
.br
If you enter this command without operands, the
default scope range will be set (cols 1-72 in
standard 'NUM' mode-, cols 01-80 in standard
'NONUM' mode- or cols 07-78 if in 'COBOL' mode)
another possibility to set the scope range is
changing the 'SCOPE' value in the right corner
of the EDIT screen.
:dt.SCR
:dd.Display the columns 9-80 of the workspace on the screen.
.br
It has no sense to change cols 73-80 on the screen,
if you are in 'NUM' mode.

With this command you are able to execute jobs in the background.
After successful submit the user will be notified
with the message 'JOB jjjjjjjj SUBMITTED'.
If the parameter SUBMIT=TSO, the TSO command processor SUBMIT will
be invoked instead of the RPF submit. With this option all
advantages of using the TSO SUBMIT exit can be used.

If you enter '4' on the RPF main menu, you get the assembler panel.
This screen contains many fields, which are described below:
:dl tsize=25
:dt.The Sourcelib field.
:dd.In this field, the membername and library name should be
specified. The dataset should be catalogued. Leave membername
blank if the dataset is sequential.
:dt.The OBJECT lib field.
:dd.In this field, the membername and library of a object card
image library should be specified. If the membername is omitted,
the membername of the sourcelib will be used.
If the library is omitted, a temporary dataset will be allocated
if assembly is selected, or no dataset will be allocated if
assembly is not selected.
:dt.The LOAD lib field.
:dd.In this field, the membername and library of a load library
should be specified. If the membername is omitted, the membername
of the object library will be used.
By default this field contains the name of the sourcelib.
Only the suffix of the datasetname is changed into 'LOAD'.
:dt.The INCLUDE library field.
:dd.This field gives you the possibility to specify a DDNAME and
a DSNAME of an extra OBJECT or LOAD library to perform extra
inclusions of OBJECT or LOAD modules during BIND
Both DDNAME and DSNAME should be specified to perform the
allocation of this dataset.
The INCLUDE of the OBJECT or LOAD modules can be done by using
the control statement fields.
:dt.The MACLIB fields.
:dd.This field contains 6 fields for maclibs to be allocated
to the assembler. The defaults are the 'SYS1.MACLIB' for the
1st field, the 'SYS3.MACLIB' for the 2nd field, and the
dataset entered in the allocation menu in the 5th field, if
the dataset is partitioned.
If one or more maclib fields are blank, the field will be
skipped.
.br
Ex. if 1st maclib is specified, 2nd maclib is blank and 3rd
maclib is specified, 2nd maclib will be skipped and 3rd maclib
becomes 2nd maclib.
:dt.The assembler field.
:dd.You can specify here 'Y' or 'N' to assemble your source or not.
Default is 'Y'.
:dt.The assembler output field.
:dd.This field contains 'Y',  or 'N'. Default is 'N'
If you specify 'Y' the SYSPRINT comes on the screen after
assembly (and link).
.br
With 'N' no browse will be invoked, except if the assember has
given a nonzero returncode. Then the SYSTERM output will be browsed.
:dt.The additional assembler parm field.
:dd.The default is blanks. You can specify here the the additional
parameters for the assembler. The parameters 'NODECK', 'LOAD'
and 'LINECOUNT(51)' are already specified.
:dt.The linkage editor field.
:dd.You can specify here 'Y' or 'N' to link edit  your assembler
object deck or not. Default is 'Y'.
:dt.The linkage editor parm field.
:dd.You can specify here the linkage editor parm.
default is 'LIST,XREF,NCAL'.
:dt.The BIND output field.
:dd.Select 'Y' or 'N' to BROWSE the linkage editor output after
BROWSE of the assembler output. Default is 'N' if the linkage editor
has a return code of 0 and 'Y' if the link has a return
code not equal 0.
:dt.The loadmodule field.
:dd.This member name is the name of the loadmodule created by
the linkage editor. If this membername is omitted the
membername of the object library is used.
:dt.The printer name
:dd.Specify here the name of the remote printer, which will receive
the output if a "PRINT" subcommand has been entered. If no printer
specified, the output will be locally printed.
:dt.The output class
:dd.Specify here the output class for the listing.
:dt.The control statement fields.
:dd.In these fields you can specify max 6 control statements
for the linkage editor.
:edl.
If you hit ENTER after changing the fields all the datasets will
be allocated. After successful allocation of the all the assembler
files the assembler will be invoked. The name of the assembler is
the name specified in the defaults menu. The start of the
assembler will be indicated to the user with the message
'ASSEMBLER RUNNING.' in the message area of the screen.
.sp
If the return code is 4 or below, the linkage editor will be invoked
(only if linkage editor=Y is selected on the screen).
The start of the linkage editor will be indicated to the user by means
of the message 'LINKEDITOR RUNNING...' in the message area.
:p.
If the assembler has ended with a return code higher than 4 the
message 'RC ASM=xx' will appear and the linkage editor will
not be executed.

The modules RPFLIB and RPFLIB00 need the file access interface
routines of the LIBRARIAN package.
Upon bind of RPFLIB and RPFLIB00 the following modules
should be included from the LIBRARIAN loadlibrary:
1. FAIROPN.  2. FAIRMOD.  3. FAIRREC.  4. FAIRCLS.
:p.
The module RPFPAN00 needs the PANVALET access method (PAM).
Please include module 'PAM' from the PANVALET library upon
bind of RPFPAN00.
:p.
For RPFTSO is an exit possibility. The name should be 'RPFTSOEX'.
RPFTSOEX is a TSO command validation exit.
In register 1 is placed a address of a fullword, that contains
the address of the RPF common area.
In the field 'CMDAREA' of the RPF common area is the TSO
command to be validated placed.
If you accept the TSO command, zero must be set in the 'RTNCODE'
field of the common area.
If you want to reject the TSO command, set a nonzero value in
'RTNCODE'
RPFTSOEX can be binded in the RPF target library.
if RPFTSOEX is not present, all the TSO commands are accepted.
:lblbox.Note
The RPF common area can be mapped, by using the 'RPFCOMM'
macro.
:elblbox.
:p.
If you want to use the HAR subcommand of RPF, then include
the application 'RPFHCPY' in application major node of your
VTAM definition library.
Example how to define RPFHCPY follows below:
:fig place=inline frame=box concat=no.
:xmp.
RPFHCPY APPL AUTH=(ACQ) /* HAR SUBCOMMAND OF RPF */
:exmp.
:figcap.define RPFHCPY

If RPF is installed, add RPFKEY00 in the
SYS1.PARMLIB in the next example:
:fig place=inline frame=box concat=no.
:xmp.
//RPFKEY00 JOB (ACCT),MSGLEVEL=1
//CREATE EXEC PGM=IEBUPDTE,PARM=NEW

In the main menu (option 5) is a user exit available:
The name of the exit should be RPFUSER1.
Each function in RPFUSER1 is allowed; e.g. filling the workspace,
link and call other RPF-routines.
The entry points of the following RPF routines are available
The entry points can be found in the 'RPFCOMM' area.
:ol c.
:li.RPFEDIT (field named EPEDIT)
:li.RPFDATAL (field named EPDATAL)
:li.RPFDAIR (field named EPDAIR)

:li.RPFUTIL (field named EPUTIL)
:li.RPFVTOC1 (field named EPVTOC1)
:li.RPFCNVDT (field named EPCNVDT)
:eol.
The other RPF routines can be obtained by the 'LINK' macro
In register 1 in RPFUSER1 is placed an address of a fullword,
which contains the address of the 'RPFCOMM' area, which can be
mapped by using the 'RPFCOMM' macro.
It is recommended to use reg 11 as the address of the 'RPFCOMM'
area and to use reg 13 as the base register.
If you want to give a message in the RPF main menu upon exit of the
RPFUSER1 routine, you can place a 25 byte message in field 'CMDAREA'
of the 'RPFCOMM' area.
If you have no RPFUSER1 exit in your installation, RPF will ignore
the exit accompanied with the message:
'RPFUSER1 NOT FOUND'
