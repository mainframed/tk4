*                    TSO HELP FOR 'RFE' RELEASE 45.0        AUGUST 2014
)F Function -
  The RFE command provides a 3270 fullscreen environment for general
  processing under TSO with an emphasis on data set operations.  The
  chief utility for examining and changing data sets is the REVIEW
  command, and for this reason it is called the "REVIEW Front End".

  RFE presents a primary option menu from which an option is selected
  by typing the option name into the primary input area.  The 'END'
  command returns control from the selected option to the primary
  option menu.

  Jumping between options directly without an intervening display
  of the main menu is also possible by prefixing the target option
  name with the equals sign.  For example, to jump to option 6
  enter the string '=6' (without the quotes) in the primary input
  area near the top of the screen.

  Multiple parallel RFE logical sessions can exist.  A new session
  is created by the 'START' command which is equivalent to entering
  'TSO RFE' in the primary input area.

  A logical RFE session is terminated by entering 'END' at the main
  menu, or selecting the primary option of 'X'.  Consequently, an
  RFE logical session can be ended by the primary input sring of
  '=X' from any RFE option.


  Graphic Displays
  ================

  For terminals with suitable graphics facilities under MVS/370,
  three graphic displays are shown on the primary option menu.

  From left to right, they are:


  (1) A plot of virtual storage usage.

      This is presented as a 64 by 64 array representing the 4,096
      4KB pages in the 16MB virtual storage address space.  Each
      array element is a 2 by 2 3270 pixel square.  The 64 by 64
      array has a white border 2 3270 pixels wide.

      The bottom row of the array represents virtual pages 0 to
      63 going left to right, the second-bottom row represents
      virtual pages 64 to 127 going left to right, and so on.

      The color codes used to represent page usage are:

      Black        - UnGETMAINed pages.  Attempting to reference
                     virtual storage addresses in these pages
                     will cause an addressing exception program
                     interrupt which MVS will convert to a S0C4
                     abnormal end (abend).

      Red          - Nucleus pages.  Under MVS/370 the nucleus
                     is V=R, which means that the real address
                     of all parts of the nucleus is the same as
                     the virtual address.  The nucleus starts
                     at address 0.  The private area starts at
                     the 64KB boundary above the nucleus.

      Green        - Private pages in a user key.  Application
                     programs and data usually reside in these
                     pages.

      White        - Private pages in a system key.  Job-related
                     system control blocks such as the Scheduler
                     Work Area (SWA) usually reside in these
                     pages at the top of the private area, while
                     authorized reentrant programs can reside in
                     these pages in lower parts of the private
                     area.

      Pink         - Local System Queue Area (LSQA).  It is the
                     residency of the LSQA which defines whether
                     an address space is swapped in or swapped out.
                     The LSQA may be swappable, but it is not
                     pagable.  The segment and page tables used
                     by Dynamic Address Translation (DAT) reside
                     in LSQA.  LSQA usually occupies the highest
                     pages in the private area.

      Blue         - Pagable common pages.  CSA subpools 231 and
                     241 use these pages.

      Yellow       - Page-fixed common pages.  CSA subpools 227
                     and 228 use these pages.

      Shaded green - The Link Pack Area (LPA).  The LPA contains
                     reentrant programs permanently resident in
                     virtual storage.

      Turquoise    - The System Queue Area (SQA).  The SQA is not
                     pagable and contains control blocks used for
                     managing the whole system.  All SQA storage
                     is in key 0.


  (2) A bar graph of the frame count versus UIC distribution.

      The X-axis covers the allowable Unreferenced Interval Count
      (UIC) range from 0 to 255 with each 3270 pixel covering 2
      adjacent UIC values.  The Y-axis plots the number of frames
      with a given UIC value at a scale of 2 frames per 3270 pixel.
      Vertical bar plots are truncated at a frame count of 256
      which corresponds to 1MB of real storage.

      If a page frame has not been referenced for 10 SRM intervals,
      it is said to have a UIC of 10.  An SRM interval may be
      something like a couple of seconds elapsed time, depending
      on the CPU speed adjustment factor, which is obviously
      model-dependent.


  (3) A plot of real storage usage.

      This is presented as a 64 by 64 array representing the 4,096
      4KB frames that can exist when the maximum real storage size
      of 16MB is present.  Each array element is a 2 by 2 3270 pixel
      square.  The 64 by 64 array has a white border 2 3270 pixels
      wide.

      The bottom row of the array represents page frames 0 to
      63 going left to right, the second-bottom row represents
      page frames 64 to 127 going left to right, and so on.

      The color codes used to represent frame usage are:

      Black        - Unused frames available for use.

      Red          - Non-RSM frames.  Frames that are not managed
                     by the Real Storage Manager are nucleus frames,
                     bad frames (those found to have an error),
                     and frames varied offline.

      Green        - Pagable private storage.

      Pink         - Page-fixed private storage.

      Turquoise    - SQA and LSQA storage.  SQA pages tend to occupy
                     the frames with the highest addresses.

      Blue         - Pagable common (CSA and LPA) storage.

      Yellow       - Page-fixed common (CSA and LPA) storage.

      White        - All frames containing private pages including
                     LSQA belonging to >this< address space.  Since
                     >this< address space will usually be a TSO user
                     address space, these pages will be available for
                     reuse by the time you are reading this, because
                     the system will swap out your TSO session while
                     it waits for the next input from your TSO
                     terminal.  (While MVS 3.8J does not perform
                     logical swapping, it does exploit page reclaim.)


  Profile data set
  ================

  It is possible to save various settings across RFE and TSO sessions.
  For this to occur the settings must be saved in permanent storage.
  This is achieved by writing those settings to a permanent data set
  at the end of an RFE session.

  The profile data set is a single PDS allocated to the ISPPROF file
  under z/OS, or the REVPROF file under MVS/370.  From a data
  management point of view, the profile data set contains fixed-length
  80-byte records.

  Various settings such as customized Program Function Key assignments,
  scroll amounts, display settings, editor settings, and recent TSO
  commands can be saved into the various members of the profile data
  set.

  Changes are saved by default (when the profile data set is allocated)
  but usually profile changes can be discarded if functions are
  terminated with the 'CANCEL' command instead of the usual 'END'
  command.

=KEYS=?
)F   The KEYS subcommand displays the current Program Function Key
  values.  Each PF Key (1 to 24) has a default value which may
  be changed with the PFK command.
)X Syntax -
     KEYS

 Alias    - ?
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=RECALL=RETRIEVE
)F   The RECALL subcommand causes previously typed-in commands to be
  displayed in the primary input area where they may be changed if
  required and then reissued.  Note that single character input strings
  and text implied by PFK usage are not recallable.  The first command
  recalled is the most recently typed in command.  Consecutive RECALL
  commands cause increasingly older commands to be recalled.
)X Syntax -
     RECALL

 Alias    - The DUP character (X'1C').
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=PFK
)F   The PFK subcommand changes PFK definitions for the duration of
  the REVIEW session; to change a PFK, a subcommand such as
  'PFK6 RIGHT 1'  is entered to change PFK6 to 'RIGHT 1'.

  By default, the PF KEYS are defined as the following:
              PFK1  - HELP    PFK2  - START      PFK3  - END
              PFK4  - TSO     PFK5  - RFIND      PFK6  - RCHANGE

  Changes to the PFK assignments may be saved in the profile data set.
)X Syntax -
     PFK## 'newpfdata'

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - None.
 Required - nn and 'newpfdata'
)O Operands -
)P  ##      - Specifies the PF Key to be modified.
              ## is a 1 or 2 decimal digit number in the range of
              0 to 24 inclusive.  Numbers from 1 to 24 specify a
              particular Program Function Key.  If ## is 0 then
              all 24 PF Keys will be assigned their default values.

 'newpfdata'- Specifies the new subcommand for this PF Key.
=SCRNAME
)F   The SCRNAME subcommand allows a new name to be assigned to the
  active logical screen.  This name can be used as the operand of
  a SWAP subcommand.  Screen names are displayed by SWAP LIST.
)X Syntax -
     SCRNAME 'name'

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - None.
 Required - name
)O Operands -
)P 'name'   - Specifies the screen name.  It can be up to eight
              characters long.  It cannot be completely numeric.
              It should not be 'NEXT', 'PREV' or 'LIST'.
=START=SPLIT
)F   The START subcommand requests that a new parallel session is
  to be initiated and given control.  The new session will be under
  the RFE (REVIEW Front End) menu hierarchy.  The new session will
  NOT be started if it would cause the maximum logical session
  limit to be exceeded.  If no operand is supplied the RFE primary
  option menu is shown.
)X Syntax -
     START  'option'

 Alias    - SPLIT
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands -
)P 'option' - any valid RFE main menu option.  An invalid option
              will cause the main menu to be shown with the
              'Invalid command' message.
=SWAP
)F   The SWAP subcommand specifies which parallel REVIEW session
  is to become the current session.  It can also list the started
  REVIEW sessions which are eligible to become the current session.
  A parallel REVIEW session is created when the REVIEW TSO subcommand
  (not the ISPF TSO subcommand) is used to create a recursive REVIEW
  session.  The nesting order of these sessions can be changed by SWAP.
)X Syntax -
     SWAP   LIST / NEXT / PREV / # / 'name'

 Aliases  - None.
 Default  - switch to previous screen which is listed second
            by SWAP LIST
 Required - None.
)O Operands -
)P 'name'   - Specifies the target screen name which can be up to
            eight characters long.
))LIST    - Specifies that all parallel REVIEW sessions are to be
            listed.
))NEXT    - Requests switching to next session in increasing
            session-id order.
))PREV    - Requests switching to next session in decreasing
            session-id order.
))#       - Specifies the decimal number of the target session
            that is to be swapped with the current session.
            'SWAP 0' is a no-operation.
=TSO=TSS
)F   The TSO subcommand specifies a TSO command processor to be
  invoked from the REVIEW processor.  Commands generating an implicit
  EXEC such as SYSPROC member names and commands immediately prefixed
  by a percent sign (%) are supported.
)X Syntax -
     TSO  'command' 'operands'

 Alias    - TSS
 Defaults - None.
 Required - 'command'
)O Operands -
)P 'command'  - Specifies a TSO command to be executed.

)P 'operands' - Specifies any desired operands for this TSO command.
=CANCEL=CAN
)F   The CANCEL subcommand performs the same processing as the END
  subcommand without saving the recent TSO command list changes made
  this session.  If the TSO command processing option is reselected
  the saved command list shown will be the same as at the start of
  the current session.  If CANCEL (but not CAN) has any operands
  specified it is processed as the TSO FIB command CANCEL and not
  as the local RFE subcommand, which allows the TSO CANCEL command
  to be issued from this option.
)X Syntax -
     CANCEL

 Alias    - CAN
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=END
)F   The END subcommand terminates the option and returns control
  to the RFE primary option menu.
)X Syntax -
     END

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=EXIT=RETURN==X
)F   The EXIT subcommand terminates the RFE logical session, also
  referred to as a parallel session, or "split screen".  When
  the last logical session is terminated the whole RFE/REVIEW
  environment is terminated, which usually means that the TSO
  READY prompt will be issued.
)X Syntax -
     EXIT

 Aliases  - RETURN, =X
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
