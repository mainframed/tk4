*        INITKSDS may be invoked as a TSO command using the           *
*        following syntax:                                            *
*                                                                     *
*            INITKSDS 'data-set-name'                                 *
*                      RESET/NORESET/ERASE/DELETE                     *
*                      SHR/OLD                                        *
*                                                                     *
*            'data-set-name' is the data set name of the KSDS.        *
*                                                                     *
*            'NORESET' specifies that the KSDS has just been          *
*            DEFINEd, contains no records, and must be converted to   *
*            "non-create" mode by adding/deleting a dummy record.     *
*            This is the default.                                     *
*                                                                     *
*            'RESET' specifies that the KSDS contains records and     *
*            that these records should be deleted.  RESET can be      *
*            used instead of DELETE/DEFINE/INITKSDS to create an      *
*            empty KSDS in non-create mode.  ERASE or DELETE are      *
*            equivalent to RESET.                                     *
*                                                                     *
*            'OLD' specifies that the data-set(s) should be           *
*            allocated with DISP=OLD instead of SHR, which is the     *
*            default.                                                 *
*                                                                     *
*        INITKSDS may be invoked as a batch program, using the        *
*        following JCL:                                               *
*                                                                     *

*        INITKSDS may be also be invoked from an assembler program,   *
*        as follows:                                                  *
*                                                                     *

*          If the VSAM data set is allocated with FREE=CLOSE,         *
*          INITKSDS re-allocates it dynamically to initialize it.     *
