EXHIBIT: Present Operating System Status At A Glance
----------------------------------------------------



EXHIBIT is  designed to present the  current status of  the Operating
System at  a glance;  the information  is displayed on a  Cathode Ray
Tubeœ device  (such as the IBM 3270).  The information on the  CRT is
updated approximately  every 5  seconds. The basic Display shows:

   ø Status of active tasks in the system
   ø Job Queue Status
   ø Hardware unit  status;  lists  online disks,   offline units,
     mount requests and intervention requests.
   ø Unanswered replies with text of the request

Additional functions are available on request  by the CRT user.  Some
are Operator oriented; others are for exclusive use by System Support
Personnel, most others may be useful for the general user.

Exhibit  is  a  proprietary  product   begun  at  Pinkerton  Computer
Consultants,  Inc.,  enhanced at  American Management Systems,  Inc..
All  rights   to  the  Exhibit   package  belong  to   Expert  System
Programming, Inc. (ESP). The primary author is Gerhard Postpischil.

œThe acronym CRT is used to denote any display device which operates in
 full-screen I/O mode, as opposed to character or line mode. "IBM 3270"
 is used to denote any device usable with the common 3270 family Data
 Stream orders and CCWs.



Quick Start
-----------

Connect a tn3270 session to CUU 0C4 and, optionally, a 3287 printer to
CUU 0C7.

On an MVS console enter

f net,netsol=no
v net,inact,id=cuu0c4
v net,inact,id=cuu0c7
f net,netsol=yes
s exhibit

Note: The first four commands need to be issued only once, i.e. after
      having stopped EXHIBIT it suffices to issue S EXHIBIT to restart.

Without any further interaction, a system overview is displayed on the
tn3270 screen. This display is refreshed every 5 seconds. To issue an
EXHIBIT command, ENTER must be pressed first, which will cause a YES?
prompt, allowing to enter a command. Note, that a RAKF login will be
requested before the first command can be entered.

Use the EXHIBIT HELP command or refer to dataset EXH.UDOC for further
information.
