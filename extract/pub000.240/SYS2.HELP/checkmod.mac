)F FUNCTION -
  The CHECKMOD command checks whether a load module is available
  to the current TSO session by searching JOBLIB, STEPLIB, link
  list and link pack area.
)X SYNTAX   -
              CHECKMOD 'LOADMOD' VERBOSE/QUIET NOLOAD/LOAD
)O OPERANDS -
))'LOADMOD' -  'LOADMOD' is the name of the load module to check.
))VERBOSE   -  specifies that the result is to be communicated to
               the terminal. This is the default.
))QUIET     -  specifies that the result message is to be
               suppressed. This switch is intended to support using
               CHECKMOD in a CLIST which will just need the return
               code from variable &LASTCC for conditional
               processing.
))NOLOAD    -  specifies that the LOADability of the module in
               the current environment is not to be verified.
               This is the default.
))LOAD      -  specifies that CHECKMOD shall try to load the
               module after it has been found. Depending on the
               setting of the VERBOSE switch the result of the load
               operation is communicated to the terminal.
))NOTES     -
   Return codes: CHECKMOD uses the following return codes:
                        0 - the load module was found
                        4 - the load module was found but
                            CHECKMOD wasn't able to load it
                        8 - the load module wasn't found
                       12 - invalid syntax and prompting
