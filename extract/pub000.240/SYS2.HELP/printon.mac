)O OPERANDS -
))'DSLIST'         - 'DATA SET LIST' contains the names of data sets
                     to be listed. The names should follow
                     TSO convention, in quotes if the primary index
                     differs from your userid, or without quotes and
                     with the primary index omitted if it is the same
                     as your userid (or the currently set PREFIX).
))SNUM             - The last 8 columns of fixed-length records
                     and the first 8 columns of variable length records
                     will not be printed. This allows sequence numbers
                     to be suppressed from the print.
))VOLUME('VOLSER') - Volume serial of volume on which data sets
                     to be printed are found. This volume serial
                     will be used for all data sets specified in
                     the data set list.
