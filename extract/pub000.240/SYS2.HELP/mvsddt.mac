MVS Dynamic Debug Tool (MVSDDT)
-------------------------------

The MVS Dynamic Debug Tool is a client/server debugging tool for
MVS 3.8 running under Hercules. MVS DDT consists of three major
components:

o A server which executes as a batch job running the MVSDDT program
  on MVS.

o A TSO command processor which is a version of the server used for
  debugging programs executing in the foreground under TSO. Enter
  HELP DTT to display usage information for the command processor.

o The client which is a Java application running on any platform
  supporting version 6 of the Java Runtime Environment.

The server attaches the program to be debugged, and then monitors
and controls its execution. You interact with the server using the
facilities of the client's graphical user interface (GUI). The
communication path between the client and the server is defined by
a TCP/IP connection. To facilitate this connection, you simply
define a pair of CTCT devices in your Hercules configuration.
These definitions provide the MVS system with a pair of CTC
devices which the MVSDDT program can read from and write to;
no actual TCP/IP support is required on the MVS system. On TK4-,
the MVSDDT server component is preinstalled and the CTC device pair
is defined at CUU 610 and 611 using ports 17610/18610 and 17611/18611,
matching the default settings of the MVSDDT client.

The client GUI displays information in multiple windows on your
desktop:

o The DDT Command Center.

o Separate windows for each CSECT contained in the load module
  module being debugged.

o Any number of windows displaying various areas of storage.

o Watch List windows actively displaying variables.

The Java client installer can be found in TK4-.SHELBY.MVSDDT.V400.ZIP
