)F FUNCTION
  The BLKSPTRK command calculates direct access storage device track
  capacities. For a given list of device types, this command will
  display exactly how many blocks of a given size (with or without
  keys) will fit on each track.

  This command also computes the usable track residue showing the
  largest block that will still fit at the end of a track that has been
  filled with blocks all of the given size.

)X SYNTAX
             BLKSPTRK (devtype devtype ...)
                      BLKSIZE(<size or #count> <size or #count> ...)
                      KEYLEN(length length ...)
  Alias    - BPT
  Default  - BLKSPTRK BLKSIZE(#1) KEYLEN(0)
  Required - at least one devtype

  Note     - Lists of values may be given for both the devtype,
             BLKSIZE, and KEYLEN operands. When lists are given,
             BLKSPTRK will produce a matrix of all value combinations.
             The size of the report will be the product of the number
             of values given in each list. Example:

                 BPT (2314 3380 9345) BLKSIZE(1 99999 #2) KEY(0 1)

             This causes BLKSPTRK to product an 18 line report.

)O OPERANDS
))devtype -
         This operand is required. It must contain a list of one or
         more direct access storage device types. (e.g. 3330, 2305-2,
         etc.).  If more than one device type is given, then the list
         must be enclosed within parentheses. Currently (JUL97) the
         following device types are recognized:
               2301     (parallel drum)
               2302     (disk)
               2303     (serial drum)
               2305-1   (drum, 2 logical tracks per physical track)
               2305-2   (drum, 1 logical track  per physical track)
               2311     (removable disk)
               2314     (removable disk)
               2319     (same as 2314)
               2321     (data cell)
               3330     (removable disk)
               3340     (disk)
               3350     (disk)
               3375     (disk)
               3380     (disk)
               3390     (disk)
               3995-111 (removable optical disk - CD-ROM)
               3995-113 (removable optical disk - CD-ROM)
               3995-151 (removable optical disk - CD-ROM)
               3995-153 (removable optical disk - CD-ROM)
               9345     (rack-mounted disk)

         Notes:

           - In JUL97 I extensively verified program output against
             published track capacity tables for the following devices:
                 2305-1 2305-2 3330 3350 3380 3390 and 9345.
             The program output matched the published data for all
             tested devices except the 2305-1 drum.

           - For 2305-1 drums, the BLKSPTRK program disagreed with
             the published information relating to the maximum size
             blocks that can fit n times per track for the following
             values of "n":
                 #5 #7 #8 #15 #18 #21 #23 #24 #27 #52 and #36.
             In each case the reported maximum blksize was one byte
             greater than the published maximum blksize.

             This descrepancy did not occur for any other tested DASD,
             and in particular it did not occur for 2305-2 drums!

             It is possible that for the 2305-1 drum, the computation
             factors and parameters used by BLKSPTRK might be
             incorrect; however, it is also possible that the published
             tables themselves are wrong. But at this point (JUL97) it
             is both too late and not worth it to double check those
             factors.

             For what it's worth, the published capacity tables were
             found in GA26-1589-3: "Reference Manual for IBM 2835
             Storage Control and IBM 2305 Fixed Head Storage Module".
             The computation parameters used by BLKSPTRK for the 2305-1
             are:
                 DASD Type:                 Non-cellular
                 Track Capacity:            X'38E8' bytes
                 Overhead (all blocks):     X'027A'
                 Unkeyed Block Underhead:   X'CA'
                 Tolerance Factor (all but  X'0200' (X'0200' has no
                 the last block):                   effect)

))BLKSIZE -
         This operand is optional. If omitted, then B(#1) is used. If
         given, then it must specify a list of one or more physical
         block sizes and/or block counts.

         A block size is given as a plain number (e.g., B(6160)). A
         block count is given preceded by a pound sign (e.g., B(#5)).

         When a block count is given, BLKSPTRK displays the size of the
         largest block that fits the given number of times on a track.

         Notes:

           - Giving a zero value is equivalent to giving #1. Thus, all
             of the following are equilivant: BLKSIZE(#1) BLKSIZE(#0)
             and BLKSIZE(0).

           - Giving a block count that is higher than the most number
             of blocks that can fit on a track causes BLKSPTRK to
             devolve to showing the maximum number of blocks (1 byte in
             size) that will fit per track. Thus, the following are
             equivalent: BLKSIZE(#200) and BLKSIZE(1).

           - Giving a block size that is larger than the largest block
             that can fit on a track causes BLKSPTRK to devolve to
             showing the largest block that will fit. Thus, the
             following are equivalent: BLKSIZE(99999) and BLKSIZE(#1).

         Example:

         BPT (3380 3390) BLKSIZE(#1 #200) KEY(0 1)
         This produces a 8-line report (4 lines for each disk) showing
         (a) the largest block that will fit on a track (#1) and (b)
         the most number of blocks that will fit per track (#200). The
         information is shown both for keyed (KEY(1)) and unkeyed
         (KEY(0)) blocks.

))KEYLEN -
         This operand is optional. If omitted, then a zero value is
         used. if given, then it may specify one or more key lengths to
         be used in the track capacity calculations.

         Example:

         BPT (3380 3390) BLKSIZE(#1 #200) KEY(0 1)
         This produces a 8-line report (4 lines for each disk) showing
         (a) the largest block that will fit on a track (#1) and (b)
         the most number of blocks that will fit per track (#200). The
         information is shown both for keyed (KEY(1)) and unkeyed
         (KEY(0)) blocks.
