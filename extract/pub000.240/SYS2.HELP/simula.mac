SIMULA 67 (Version 12.00) Compiler and Runtime Environment
----------------------------------------------------------

The two main objects of the SIMULA language are:

1. to provide a language for a precise and standardized
   description of a wide class of phenomena, belonging to what
   we may call "discrete event systems".

2. to provide a programming language for an easy generation of
   simulation programs for "discrete event systems".

SIMULA is based on ALGOL and contains that language as a sub-
set.  The extension consists of the introduction of some new
basic concepts, new statements which operate upon these concepts
and a set of library procedures.  In order to achieve the greatest
possible logical integration of SIMULA and ALGOL, the scope of
some of the ALGOL statements has been extended to operate also
upon the new concepts introduced.

Refer to SYS2.JCLLIB(TESTSIMU) for a sample SIMULA program compilation
and execution.

The following cataloged procedures are available for use with SIMULA:

SIM      -- execute a sequence of SIMULA programs
SIMC     -- compile a SIMULA program
SIMCL    -- compile and link a SIMULA program
SIMCLG   -- compile, link and execute a SIMULA program
SIMCG    -- compile and execute a SIMULA program
SIMG     -- execute a SIMULA program
