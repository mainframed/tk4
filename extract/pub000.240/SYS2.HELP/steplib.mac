STEPLIB is a tso command processor that will allow concatenation
of load libraries as the 'STEPLIB' in a TSO session.

The program must reside in a linklist library and be linked
AC(1), i.e., authorized. For turnkey, use SYS2.CMDLIB.

The command is executed from the TSO command line:

     STEPLIB DA(dsn1,dsn2,dsn3...) SHR/OLD ªAPPend³ ªAPF³
where :
    dsn1/2/3 are fully qualified, quoted data set names if not belonging
    to the user whose session is executing, e.g.,

     STEPLIB ('EXPL.PHASEII') SHR     - or -

simply the 2nd, 3rd, etc. level qualifiers if belonging to
the user whose session is executing, e.g.,

     STEPLIB (JOBS.LOAD) SHR

Up to six 'load' data sets may be included in the concatenation,
each separated by commas. If the disposition is not included
(i.e., OLD or SHR), SHR is assumed.

An example of multiple data set concatenation is :

     STEPLIB DA('EXPL.PHASEII',JOBS.LOAD,LINK.LOAD) SHR

To delete the 'STEPLIB' concatenations simply enter :

     STEPLIB

Additional features added by Gerhard Postpischil gerhardp@charter.net
STEPLIB may be reassembled with a parameter specifying the number of
concatenated data sets to be support, when six is unsuitable.

     STEPLIB  LIST      will list current and old libraries

     STEPLIB (ds...) APPend    will concatenate existing system
                               STEPLIB/JOBLIB data after user's

     STEPLIB (ds...) APF       will authorize the entire concatenation;
                               auditors just love this.

     STEPLIB (ds...) LIST      will list current and old entries
                               after allocation.
