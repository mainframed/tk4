* DESCRIPTIVE NAME = SCRATCH/RENAME A DATA SET WITHOUT ENQ            *
*                                                                     *
* FUNCTION = This program was designed for systems programmers        *
*            who install a new version of MVS or another software     *
*            product.  They sometimes face a situation where they     *
*            have to delete or rename a data set not currently        *
*            allocated to anyone but which they can't delete          *
*            because it has the same name as another data set         *
*            which (1) exists on a different disk volume and          *
*            (2) is currently allocated to a long-running task.       *
*                                                                     *
*            BYPASSNQ is a driver that allows you to run any          *
*            utility program (such as IEHPROGM or IDCAMS) and         *
*            bypass dsname ENQ that is normally performed by          *
*            the DYNALLOC, SCRATCH and RENAME SVCs.                   *
*            This technique allows data sets to be deleted or         *
*            renamed using standard MVS services and is fully         *
*            compatible with indexed VTOCs and SMS.                   *
*                                                                     *
