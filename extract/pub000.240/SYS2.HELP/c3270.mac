)F FUNCTION -
  The C3270 command is used in CLISTs for full-screen displays
  on a 3270 terminal screen.
)X SYNTAX -
              C3270 WCC('CHAR') RESET('LINE') CLEAR GS/GETSIZE
                    MESSAGE('ROW','COL','MESS') CURSOR('ROW','COL')
                    READTO('VAR')  AI/ASIS TA/TRANSADD NE/NOEDIT
)O OPERANDS -
))WCC('CHAR') -  'CHAR' is the write control character to
               be used. 'C' is the default.
))RESET('LINE') - 'LINE' is the line you wish the line
               counter to be set to. normal output begins
               at this line. 'LINE' defaults to '1'.
))CLEAR  -     causes the screen to be cleared.
))MESSAGE('ROW','COL','MESS') - displays a message on the
               screen. 'ROW' and 'COL' are the row and
               column where the message starts. 'MESS' is
               the message (see note).
))CURSOR('ROW','COL') - moves the cursor to location given.
))READTO('VAR') - obtains reply and places in CLIST var-
               iable 'VAR'. 'VAR' must be pre-initialized
               to have sufficient room for the reply.
))AI  -  suppresses the removal of leading SBA from reply
))GS  -  Store the current screen dimensions in
               CLIST variables C3270ROW and C3270COL.
               These variables must have been initialized
               to three-character strings prior to
               running C3270 with the GS/GETSIZE operand.

))TA  -  interpret six bytes following an SBA, EUA
               or RA order in the MESSAGE operand or the
               CLIST variable defined through the READTO
               operand as two three digit EBCDIC encoded
               numbers defining a row and a column. The
               corresponding 3270 buffer address for the
               current screen width is calculated from
               these numbers on output. On input these
               numbers are calculated from the 3270
               buffer address received. It should be noted
               that specifying an address as row/column
               using the TA operand allows to address any
               position on screens of arbitrary dimensions,
               while the 3270 buffer address characters
               that are to be specified when TA isn't
               used are recalculated assuming an 80
               character screen width for compatibility
               with older c3270 versions.

))NE  -  use TPUT NOEDIT instead of TPUT FULLSCR for output
               and set STFSMODE ON,NOEDIT=YES on input.
               This enables usage of the SFE and MF extended
               datastream orders. Note that on MVS 3.8j
               NOEDIT isn't supported out of the box. Usermod
               ZP60009 (provided by Greg Price) enables NOEDIT
               support for VTAM but not for TCAM terminals
               on MVS 3.8j.
))NOTES  -
  Return-codes : C3270 returns codes in CLIST var LASTCC as follows:

   write operation only -
                        0 - normal completion
                      256 - parse error
                    other - i/o error occured

   write and read operation - the return code normally indicates which
                                 transmit key was pressed:

          241 - PF1                1 - TEST REQ
          242 - PF2              110 - PA2
          243 - PF3              125 - ENTER
          244 - PF4             2048 - PA1 (C3270 interrupted
          245 - PF5                               then resumed)
          246 - PF6
          247 - PF7              122 - PF10
          248 - PF8              128 - PF11
          249 - PF9              124 - PF12

       if none of the above:
                      256 - parse error
                      260 - clist variable-name not found
                    other - i/o error occured

  Message-note:
                  In order to give the user more control over the
               screen format, C3270 scans the message and does this:

                  Upon encountering a Ö (cent sign), C3270 removes
               the Ö (cent sign) from the message and translates
               the following character to a 3270 control character
               or a TSO problem character, using the table below:

          3270 control:                  TSO problem chars:
    char   translation   hex          char   translation   hex
     _         IC       X'13'          <         (        X'4D'
     -         SBA      X'11'          >         )        X'5D'
     ×         SF       X'1D'          "         '        X'7D'
     *         NULL     X'00'          /         ^        X'5F'
     #         RA       X'3C'          Ö         Ö        X'4A'
     @         EUA      X'12'          A    (broken bar)  X'6A'
     .         PT       X'05'          B         ,        X'6B'

          extended datastream:

     $         SFE      X'29' SF EXTNDED    attribute-value
     %         MF       X'2C' MOD FLD         pair counts
     S         SA       X'28' SET ATTR
     C                  X'42' COLOR     Ö0 -> X'00'  Ö5 -> X'05'
     H                  X'41' HIGHLITE  Ö1 -> X'01'  Ö6 -> X'06'
     G                  X'43' SYM SET   Ö2 -> X'02'  Ö7 -> X'07'
                                        Ö3 -> X'03'  Ö8 -> X'08'
                                        Ö4 -> X'04'  Ö9 -> X'09'

            Others should not be considered as defined at this time,
        but are generally translated to themselves. The problem chars
        are translated because all 3270 chars are used in address
        specification etc. but some have special significance to TSO.

  Examples:
            C3270 CLEAR MESS(10,40,'Ö#  Z')
        would clear the screen and fill from line 10, column 40 to
        the bottom of the screen with the letter 'Z'.

            C3270 CLEAR TA MESS(10,40,'Ö#010020*')
        would clear the screen and fill it with asterisks except the
        area from line 10 column 20 to line 10 column 39.
