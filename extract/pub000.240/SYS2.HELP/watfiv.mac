WATFIV - University of Waterloo FORTRAN IV System V1L5
------------------------------------------------------

WATFIV, or WATerloo FORTRAN IV, developed at the University of
Waterloo, Canada is an implementation of the Fortran computer
programming language. WATFIV was used from the late 1960s into the
mid-1980s. Because it could complete the three usual steps
("compile-link-go") in just one pass, the system became popular for
teaching students computer programming.

The high level qualifier used for the WATFIV installation is WATFIV.
A comprehensive User's Guide can be found in WATFIV.USER.GUIDE
(printable dataset with carriage control) and in WATFIV.USER.GUIDE.PDF
