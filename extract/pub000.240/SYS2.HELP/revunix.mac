 -------------------- ENTRY LIST SELECTION CODES --------------------

 These selection codes can be used to select an entry for
 processing from a directory entry list display:

   S       - Selection code for selecting a file to be REVIEWed
             or a new directory to have its entries displayed.
             'S' is the default selection code, and is assumed
             when the cursor is placed on an entry selection input
             field but no character is typed.

   A       - Selection code for selecting a file to be REVIEWed
             or a new directory to have its entries displayed.
             If a file is to be REVIEWed it will be treated as
             an ASCII text file, and not as a file containing
             EBCDIC data.  If a directory is selected the 'A'
             selection code will function as an 'S' selection code.

   E       - Selection code for selecting a file to be edited.
             ISPF/PDF Edit is used.  This will only work if the
             file is acceptable to ISPF/PDF Edit and only in an
             ISPF environment.  This will not work if the 'REVIEW'
             command is issued from 'READY' mode.

   B       - Selection code for selecting a file to be browsed.
             ISPF/PDF Browse is used.  This will only work if the
             file is acceptable to ISPF/PDF Browse and only in an
             ISPF environment.  This will not work if the 'REVIEW'
             command is issued from 'READY' mode.

   T       - Selection code for tagging an entry for later processing.
             Tagged entries are shown in high intensity in the entry
             list.  If any files are tagged, then only tagged files
             are processed during search (see SEARCH) operations.
             Further, tagging an entry may be useful for display
             control purposes when the entry list is large as RFIND
             can be used to locate the next tagged entry.  All tags
             can be cleared by REFRESH and RESET.

   R       - Selection code for resetting the tag status of an entry.
             All tags can be cleared by REFRESH and RESET.

   H       - Selection code for extracting and displaying the history
             of a program.

             The Binder API is invoked to access IDR data which is
             then formatted and shown with one item per line.  The
             last display record will usually contain the program
             bind (link edit) IDR data, including the date and time
             of the bind.

   M       - Selection code for extracting and displaying the module
             map of a program.

             The Binder API is invoked to access ESD (for compatible
             program objects) or MAP (for other levels) data which
             is then formatted and shown with one item per line.

             The types of map data shown are:
               'M'     Module
               'C'     Class
               'O'     Overlay segment
               'S'     Section within class
               'P'     Part within class
               'L'     Label within section
               'X'     Text extent within section or part
               'E'     End-of-module

             The use of FIND ALL can be used to enhance the display
             by suppressing unwanted data.

             Examples for PO level 2 program objects:
               To show only sections:
                 F SD 1 ALL
               To show only sections and their external labels:
                 F D 2 ALL

             Examples for other PO levels:
               To show only classes present:
                 F C 1 ALL
               To show all section names present:
                 F S 2 ALL

   /       - Selection code for selecting a entry to be REVIEWed
             as if the DATA operand had been specified.  Invoking
             REVIEW to process a UNIX file system allows no operands
             to be specified.  This selection code performs the same
             function as the 'S' selection code except that the DATA
             operand is deemed to have been specified.  This will
             prevent REVIEW from attempting to interpret data
             content such as pictures and ZIP directories.

              It should not be 'NEXT', 'PREV' or 'LIST'.
=START=SPLIT
)F   The START subcommand requests that a new parallel session is
  to be initiated and given control.  The new session will be under
  the RFE (REVIEW Front End) menu hierarchy.  The new session will
  NOT be started if it would cause the maximum logical session
  limit to be exceeded.  If no operand is supplied the RFE primary
  option menu is shown.
)X Syntax -
     START  'option'

 Alias    - SPLIT
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.

=SWAP
)F   The SWAP subcommand specifies which parallel REVIEW session
  is to become the current session.  It can also list the started
  REVIEW sessions which are eligible to become the current session.
  A parallel REVIEW session is created when the REVIEW TSO subcommand
  (not the ISPF TSO subcommand) is used to create a recursive REVIEW
  session.  The nesting order of these sessions can be changed by SWAP.
)X Syntax -
     SWAP   LIST / NEXT / PREV / # / 'name'

 Aliases  - None.
 Default  - switch to previous screen which is listed second
            by SWAP LIST

            that is to be swapped with the current session.
            'SWAP 0' is a no-operation.

 Alias    - TSS
 Defaults - None.
 Required - 'command'

 Required - 'entry'
)O Operands -
)P 'entry' -   The name of the entry to be placed at the top of
             the display.  If the entry list is sorted into an
             order other than entry name collating sequence then
             the exact entry name must be specified.
               If no exact entry name is found when the list is
             sorted by ID, then the operand is used to position
             the display to the matching user ID.
=SELECT=SEL=S
)F   SELECT allows a entry to be selected for REVIEW from the primary
  input area without first locating the list entry in the display.
)X Syntax -
     SELECT  'entry'

 Aliases  - SEL, S
 Defaults - None.
 Required - 'entry'
)O Operands -
)P 'entry' -   The name of an existing entry to be browsed by REVIEW.
=BROWSE=B

  primary input area without first locating the list entry in the
  display.  ISPF Browse is used.
)X Syntax -
     BROWSE  'entry'

 Alias    - B
 Defaults - None.
 Required - 'entry'
)O Operands -
)P 'entry' -   The name of an existing file to be browsed by ISPF.
=EDIT=E

  saving and changes to the REVIEW profile.
)X Syntax -
     CANCEL

 Alias    - CAN
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=END
)F   The END subcommand instructs REVIEW to display the directory

  the current directory is the root directory END will cause REVIEW
  to terminate.
)X Syntax -
     END

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
