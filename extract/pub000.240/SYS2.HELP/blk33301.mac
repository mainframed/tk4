)F FUNCTION -
  THE BLK33301 COMMAND COMPUTES AN OPTIMAL BLOCKSIZE FOR A DATA SET
  TO BE PLACED ON A 3330 MODEL 11 DISK. THE PROGRAM OUTPUT INCLUDES
  THE FOLLOWING REPORTS:
     1.  A SUMMARY BLOCKSIZE REPORT FOR THE GIVEN LRECL AND KEY
         LENGTH WHICH INCLUDES THE RECOMMENDED BLOCKSIZE TO USE.
     2.  A RECOMMENDED DATA SET SPACE ALLOCATION.
     3.  A OPTIONAL TRACK CAPACITY REPORT FOR THE PROVIDED KEY LENGTH.

  THE RECOMMENDED BLOCKSIZE VALUE IS FOR DATA SETS IN WHICH THE
  PREDOMINANT ACCESS IS SEQUENTIAL; FOR DATA SETS WHERE RANDOM
  ACCESS TIME IS CRITICAL OR THE USUAL ACCESS IS RANDOM, A SMALL
  BLOCKSIZE (500-2000 BYTES) SHOULD PROBABLY BE USED.

  THE RECOMMENDED BLOCKSIZE WILL USUALLY TEND TO BE NEAR A HALF-TRACK
  FIGURE AS THIS IS CONSIDERED TO BE THE MOST EFFICIENT IN TERMS OF
  THE TRADE-OFFS AMONG BUFFER SIZE, SECONDARY STORAGE REQUIREMENTS,
  CHANNEL USE, NUMBER OF INPUT/OUTPUTS AND OVERALL PROCESSING TIME.
  THIS FIGURE IS ONLY A GENERAL GUIDE; FOR MAXIMAL EFFICIENCY
  CONSIDERING OTHER FACTORS, STUDY THE GENERATED BLOCKSIZE SUMMARY
  REPORT OR A TRACK CAPACITY REPORT.

  THE PROGRAM'S RECOMMENDATIONS ASSUME A FAIRLY LARGE AMOUNT OF DATA
  IS TO BE STORED; DATA SETS WHICH OCCUPY ONLY A FEW TRACKS SHOULD
  PROBABLY BE PLACED IN PARTITIONED DATA SETS.  IN CASES WHERE THIS
  IS NOT FEASIBLE, THE USE OF A SMALL BLOCKSIZE (2400 - 4000 BYTES)
  MAY BE A GOOD ALTERNATIVE PRACTICE.

             BLKSIZE(RECOMMENDED VALUE),
             NUMBER(100000)
)O OPERANDS -
 'LRECL'  - THE LOGICAL RECORD LENGTH OF THE DATA WHICH IS TO BE
            PLACED IN THE DATA SET.
))KEYLENGTH('INTEGER')
          - THE KEY LENGTH, IN BYTES, OF THE KEYS TO BE USED IN THE
            DATA SET.  THE MAXIMUM LEGAL KEY LENGTH IS 255.
))TRACKCAP
          - SPECIFIES THAT A TRACK CAPACITY REPORT IS TO BE PROVIDED
            FOR THE DEVICE USING THE SPECIFIED (OR DEFAULT) KEY LENGTH.

            NOTE THAT A TRACK CAPACITY REPORT IS ALSO PROVIDED IF
            NOTRACKCAP IS NOT SPECIFIED AND LRECL EXCEEDS THE MAXIMUM
            BLOCKSIZE FOR A TRACK OR BLKSIZE EXCEEDS THE MAXIMUM
            BLOCKSIZE FOR A TRACK.
))NOTRACKCAP
          - SPECIFIES THAT A TRACK CAPACITY REPORT IS NOT DESIRED.
))BLKSIZE('INTEGER')
          - THE BLOCKSIZE TO USE FOR THE ALLOCATION COMPUTATION; IF
            BLKSIZE IS NOT ENTERED (OR ZERO IS ENTERED), THE PROGRAM'S
            RECOMMENDED BLOCKSIZE WILL BE USED.
))NUMBER('INTEGER')
          - THE NUMBER OF LOGICAL RECORDS THAT WILL BE IN THE DATA SET.
))RECORDS('INTEGER')
          - THE NUMBER OF LOGICAL RECORDS THAT WILL BE IN THE DATA SET.
))VERIFY  - SPECIFIES THAT THE MVS "TRKCALC" ROUTINE IS TO BE USED TO
            VERIFY TRACK CAPACITY CALCULATIONS.  IF VERIFY IS USED,
            THE NUMBER OF CALLS TO "TRKCALC" TO DETERMINE A TRACK
            CAPACITY TABLE IS OUTPUT AT THE END OF THE OUTPUT.

            NOTE: WITH VERIFY ON, A MINIMUM OF 34 CALLS IS REQUIRED TO
            DETERMINE A TRACK CAPACITY TABLE; OTHERWISE A MINIMUM OF
            17 CALLS IS REQUIRED TO DETERMINE THE TRACK CAPACITY TABLE.
