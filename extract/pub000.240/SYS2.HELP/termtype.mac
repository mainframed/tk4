              intended to find out whether the terminal is a 3270 or
              not and consequently C3270 can be used or not.

              The terminal type is returned to the calling CLIST
              through the LASTCC variable:

              LASTCC = 0: The terminal isn't a 3270, don't use C3270.
              LASTCC = n: The terminal is a 3270 with screen size
                          of n lines. This terminal is suitable for
                          C3270.
