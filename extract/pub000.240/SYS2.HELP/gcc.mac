GCC and PDPCLIB for z/OS and MVS/380
------------------------------------

This is a port of GCC version 3.2.3 to MVS (all versions
of MVS, from z/OS down to 3.8j plus MVS/380). GCC 3.2.3
doesn't ship with a C runtime library suitable for use
on an MVS environment, so for that, PDPCLIB is included,
to provide a complete solution to all your programming
needs. So long as you only need an ISO C90 (ANSI C89)
compiler, anyway!

Although GCC originated on an ASCII Unix environment,
this MVS version of GCC is completely unrelated to that
environment. It is an MVS EBCDIC compiler throughout.
Built on MVS, using only tools that are also available
on MVS. It does not need or use a USS environment.

The same can be said of the C runtime library. Although
there is an ASCII Windows version of PDPCLIB available
too, the MVS version was written for MVS, not Windows.

So too is the case with 24-bit support. Although MVS
3.8j (24-bit) is a supported environment, every fullword
of the 31-bit version is purely 31-bit.



Quick Start
-----------

Run SYS2.JCLLIB(TESTGCC) to make sure it works.
