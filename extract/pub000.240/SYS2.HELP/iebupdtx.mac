     IEBUPDTX is a utility program designed to facilitate updating symbo
     source data representing  80 column card images.   It will incorpor
     the   source  language   modifications  into   either  sequential
     partitioned data sets.

     The program was  written at the Cornell  University Computation Cen
     in  September  of  1971.   Robert  Lent  and  Richard  Cogger  set
     specifications  and contributed  ideas.   Larry  Brenner designed
     implemented the program.  A design goal  of IEBUPDTX was to produce
     updating program that was compatible with IBM's IEBUPDTE,  but offe
     additional capabilities.

     The current version incorporates modifications made by John R.  Ehr
     at  the  Stanford Linear  Accelerator  Center,   Seymour J.   Metz
     Pinkerton  Computer Consultants,   Inc.,  and  Gerhard Postpischil
     Expert System Programming, Inc.

     The  preliminary  version of  this  document  was based  on  Cornel
     IEBUPDTX Users  Guide,  and edited by  Anne Ashley and  Marge Muell
     Version  1 is  updated by  S.  Hsia.   Additional changes  made by
     Postpischil, including conversion to SCRIPT format.

     This manual was  produced using the SYSPUB facility  of the Univers
     of Waterloo's SCRIPT package, Version 3.2, with PARM=2P.

                                   Section 1

                                  INTRODUCTION


     IEBUPDTX is a utility program designed to facilitate updating symbo
     source data representing  80 column card images.   It will incorpor
     the   source  language   modifications  into   either  sequential
     partitioned data  sets.  A design goal  of IEBUPDTX was to  produce
     updating program that was compatible with IBM's IEBUPDTE,  but offe
     additional features and extensions.

     Following is a summary of major extensions of IEBUPDTX:

     Many keyword operands  may be specified as  positional operands.  M
     keywords  required  by  IEBUPDTE  are  made  optional  or  ignored
     IEBUPDTX.  Two examples are NEW=PO/PS;  SEQ2, NEW1,  INCR on NUMBER
     DELETE commands. SEQFLD is ignored.  The sequence field is permanen
     defined as columns 73/80.  A numeric digit must be found by column
     unless there are no sequence numbers in the source.   The LABEL det
     statement  is  not  supported.    Keyword  operands  SEQFLD,   COLU
     UPDATE=INPLACE, INHDR, INTLR, OUTHDR, OUTTLR, TOTAL, LEVEL, and SOU
     are not supported.

        * The DECK option

          Due to the  use of available features in  IEBUPDTX,  the input
          for CHANGE commands  is usually not compatible  with IEBUPDTE.
          IEBUPDTX  offers the  capability of  producing a  copy of  the
          current  update request  in  IEBUPDTE  compatible form.   This
          feature requires  the DECK option on  a PARM,  and  a SYSPUNCH
          output  file.  PARM=ADD  may  also be  specified  to copy  ADD
          requests.

        * Chained Libraries

          IEBUPDTX allows the  use of multiple versions of  a PDS member
          by the  CURRENT command and the  VERSION option and  the CHAIN
          PARM option.    With this  feature,  several  versions may  be
          stored and run by use of  version numbers.  This is especially
          useful for testing updated members.

          Additionally,  multiple versions of the chained library can be
          used as successive update decks  when the CHAINUPD PARM option
          is specified.

        * Recursive Updates

          More than one update deck may be  run against an OLD MASTER in
          one job with this feature. Successive update decks are applied
          to the OLD MASTER produced by  the preceding deck.  Thus it is
          not  necessary  to keep  the  updated  old master  source  for
          successive updates.





                             IEBUPDTX User's Guide
     Introduction                                                  Featu


        * WYLBUR Edit Format Data Sets

          WYLBUR format data sets (i.e.  RECFM=U,  LRECL=BLKSIZE=3156 or
          3520) may be used as input or output to IEBUPDTX without using
          any additional control cards.

          A new PARM  option,  INTEGER,  has been  specified to indicate
          normal mode of operation (sequence  numbers in columns 73/80).
          For files not having sequence numbers, the WYLBUR line numbers
          may be  used instead,  by  resetting the INTEGER  option (i.e.
          PARM=NOINT).  When  this option  is used,   it applies  to the
          SYSUT1,  SYSUT2,  SYSLIB  and SYSPUNCH files that  are in EDIT
          format.  Note  that use  of MACRO  or multi-member  sequential
          output for SYSUT2 or SYSPUNCH  may produce unprocessable files
          (non-ascending line numbers).

          For SYSIN (DD * or DD  DATA)  files submitted using the WYLBUR
          RUN command,  WYLBUR places line numbers into columns 73/80 by
          default,  unless the command also specifies UNN or JCL.  A new
          PARM option,   WYLRUN,  has been  defined as the  default.  It
          changes all  sequence fields which  appear to be  line numbers
          (period in column 77) to blanks; the line number is printed to
          the left  of the  card image.   As  an alternative,   the PARM
          option  WYLBUR  may be  used  to  indicate that  all  sequence
          fields,  regardless of contents,  be  changed to blanks.  This
          assumes that  you will  not include  "data statements"  in the
          input  (cards  to  be inserted  or  replaced,   with  explicit
          sequence numbers in columns 73/80).

        * TSO datasets

          IEBUPDTX  supports datasets  with RECFM=V  (e.g.  TSO  CLIST),
          which contain the sequence numbers in columns 1 to 8. Prior to
          using such an input record,  the  card image is re-arranged so
          that the sequence number falls into columns 73/80;  on output,
          the sequence number is again placed in columns 1 to 8.

        * Listing Controls

          Additional listing controls are another IEBUPDTX feature.  New
          master source is not listed unless the ADD or CHANGE specifies
          LIST=ALL. Old master cards renumbered as a result of an insert
          operation may optionally be listed,  as may any deleted cards.
          Also  optional is  the  listing  of insertions  and  deletions
          caused by intermediate updates.

          The listing related PARM options are as follows :

          1)  LISTING (default),  when negated,  causes listing of major
              control cards only, and overrides all other list options.

          2)  LISTADD (default)  causes listing of card images processed
              by an ADD or REPL command,  but not CHANGE or REPRO cards.






                             IEBUPDTX User's Guide
     Introduction                                                  Featu


              For  CHANGE/REPRO,   only  modified cards  are  listed  by
              default.

          3)  LISTDEL  (default)   causes listing  of  deleted  records.
              Cards altered by FIX, SCAN,  CFIX and CSCAN are considered
              "deleted" for purposes of listing.

          4)  LISTRN causes listing of old  master statements which were
              forcibly renumbered due to an INSERT operation.

          5)  LISTALL causes  action of,   but does  not set,   LISTADD,
              LISTDEL, LISTRN; it is offered as a convenience.

          6)  LISTLEV  causes   listing  of   modifications  caused   by
              intermediate update decks (refer to Sections 6.2 and 6.3).

          7)  LIST=ALL on  a major  control card  causes the  entire new
              master to be listed unless NOLISTING is set.

        * Use of Library Source

          The  COPY/MACRO commands  allow data  to be  entered into  the
          update program from a separate library, rather than from SYSIN
          only.   Note that  MACRO keeps the sequence  numbers of copied
          cards, and may thus destroy existing sequencing.  It should be
          used for permanent output files with due caution.

        * New Commands

          Table  1  shows  the  IEBUPDTX  equivalents  of  IBM  IEBUPDTE
          commands.   A number of new commands are featured in IEBUPDTX,
          some  representing   extensions  to  functions   available  in
          IEBUPDTE,  and some invoking new features.   A list of the new
          commands and their functions is shown in Table 2.

        * GANG-Punching Id

          The  GANG  statement  allows  an  identification  code  to  be
          inserted as though a deck has been gang-punched. Thus a series
          of updates  may be  easily distinguished  from one  another by
          their id codes.   GANG may be  specified as a detail statement
          with an ADD/CHANGE  operation,  or globally as  a PARM option.
          The value specified  by GANG overlays existing data  on a card
          image unconditionally.  To avoid this, the ASM PARM option may
          be used. ASM will cause insertion of the GANG id only in cards
          which have a  blank in column 72,  and blanks  from the column
          preceding the id  column to the column after.   Note that this
          option will  not add GANG  information to  a card which  has a
          prior GANG id, with one special exception.  When the length of
          the GANG id is five characters, and the old card contains five
          numerics  delimited by  blanks  in the  id  column,  the  GANG
          information replaces the old data.   This is intended for GANG
          in date format (yyddd).

        * Modifying Statements at Intra-card level

          The FIX and  SCAN statements allow a card image  to be changed
          at the character level by specifying a string and, optionally,
          a column range on the card.  When a FIX or SCAN request is not
          satisfied,  the  update is  terminated for  that function.   A
          conditional FIX/SCAN capability exists using the CFIX or CSCAN
          detail statements.   When CFIX or  CSCAN is not  satisfied,  a
          warning message is printed, but the update continues.

        * Numbering on ADD or CHANGE Card

          Numbering may be specified directly on  the ADD or CHANGE card
          using the keywords INCR and NEW1.

        * Replace/Insert Cards

          IEBUPDTE replaces or inserts card images when it finds a "data
          statement"  (card  image  with  sequence  numbers  in  columns
          73/80),  or when  it detects a ./  NUMBER INSERT=YES statement
          followed by  unsequenced cards.   IEBUPDTX provides  a shorter
          form of the NUMBER command with the name INSERT,  and adds the
          option of deleting a range of cards from the old master before
          doing an optional insertion,  using the REPLACE statement (not
          to be confused with REPL).  Unlike IEBUPDTE, INSERT and DELETE
          statements  for the  same  range may  be  specified in  either
          order.   For compatibility with  IEBUPDTE,  the data statement
          with sequence numbers in columns 73/80 is permitted.

        * Program Error Control

          A  PARM  option  allows  user  specification  of  the  highest
          severity error. If any error occurs above the limit, execution
          will stop.

        * PDS Handling Commands

          Several commands  apply only  to PDS  members and  provide the
          ability to LIST the  contents of a PDS member,  LOAD  a set of
          update decks  under the names on  their CHANGE and  ADD cards,
          RENAME or  SCRATCH a member.  GENALIAS  may be used to  add an
          ALIAS to  an existing member;   the RESTORE statement  may (in
          limited circumstances)  permit retrieval of a member which was
          scratched.

        * Updating of update decks

          Control cards recognized by IEBUPDTE and IEBUPDTX require a ./
          in columns 1/2.  This makes  it difficult to maintain datasets
          containing update control cards.  IEBUPDTX provides a CTL PARM
          which  permits  specification  of the  bytes  which  signal  a
          control card (instead of ./ ).

     1.1   PARM OPTIONS
           ____ _______

     The following options  may be included in  the PARM field of  the E
     card or in a  ./ PARM command supplied as a  function statement.  W
     supplied from the EXEC PARM field,  at most 71 characters are allow
     Unlike other control cards,  PARM operands  may be separated by eit
     blanks or commas, but continuation and comments are not allowed.
     PARM command may be used more than once in a run, but only in the f
     of a  function statement.   Negation of  an option is  accomplished
     prefixing the option  with NO,  or by  specifying it in the  form o
     keyword as "option=NO".   Note that CHAIN=NO acts as NOCHAIN, and d
     not assign an ID of NO.

     +------------------------------------------------------------------

     For example,  the libraries used may be changed dynamically.   The
     output master is SYSUT2 by default. This may be changed :

          ./ PARM  OUTDD=SYSUT3
          closes SYSUT2 and opens SYSUT3.

     The PARM options are given below with their defaults shown:

     (NO)ADD  When  used with  the  DECK option,   ADD  will  result in
              IEBUPDTE compatible deck being punched  for modules that w
              ADDed.  If  the ADD  PARM option is  omitted,  decks  for
              modules will not be produced.

     (NO)ASM  The ASM option  prevents uncontrolled overlay of  text by
              GANG statement. See PARM=GANG and ./ GANG for details.

     (NO)CHAIN
     CHAIN=NO
     CHAIN=id CHAIN specifies that  SYSUT2 is a CHAINed  library,  and t
              VERSION numbers  will be required  on CHANGE and  ADD cont
              cards  unless doing  a ./  LOAD.  The  "id" is  a two  let
              library identification  code,  which will  be used  to cre
              internal  names  for  new  versions  of  members.   Once
              allocator  (@LLOCATR)   has  been  stowed  in  the  librar
              directory,  the id cannot be changed.  If the id has been
              previously, you may code CHAIN rather than CHAIN=id.

     (NO)CHAIN      Specifies  whether  or not  chained  members  found
              intermediate updates in PDSs are to  be applied as an orde
              set  of recursive  updates (otherwise,   only the  product
              version is used).

     COND=8   Sets the maximum allowed severity error message. All IEBUP
              error messages  have associated  with them  a potential  s
              return code.  Default is eight, which allows both errors f
              which  immediate recovery  is possible,   such  as an  ins
              operation which doesn't provide any  new data to insert,
              errors  which  require  termination  of  the  current  mem
              update, but allow the program to go on to the next update
              SYSIN). COND=4 prohibits recovery for these latter errors
              might be desirable when SYSUT2  is sequential.  COND=0 for
              termination following any error or  warning message;  this
              desirable when taking SNAP dumps after each error. COND=12
              not recommended.  It might allow  the program to recover f
              such things as sequential SYSLIBs, but then again...

     CTL=./   By  default,  all  IEBUPDTE and  IEBUPDTX  control cards
              identified by "./" in columns 1/2.   The CTL parameter may
              used to reset all subsequent  processing to recognize the
              CTL  string.  This  feature  permits  IEBUPDTX to  manipul
              update  decks as  though they  were card  images (subject
              normal  sequencing   and  other  constraints).     The  va
              specified by  the CTL  parameter must have  a length  of t
              neither byte may be a comma (or  blank),  and at least one
              the  two must  have  a value  lower than  "A"  in the  EBC
              collating sequence.  For example :

                   ./ PARM CTL=@/
                   @/ ADD  NAME=A
                   ./ ADD  NAME=B
                   card 1
                   card 2
                   ./ CHANGE NAME=C

              The above sequence  adds member A to the  output master;
              contents of A are the update statements for members B and

     (NO)DECK Specifies whether or  not an IEBUPDTE compatible  update d
              equivalent  (except for  sequencing)   for subsequent  CHA
              operations is to be punched (written to SYSPUNCH).  The pu
              file may  be a sequential or  partitioned dataset.  If  it
              partitioned,  the  member name must  appear either on  the
              card, or on all ADD and CHANGE statements.  If the new mas
              is based in any  way on data provided by an  ADD command,
              DECK will be  produced for that member unless  the ADD opt
              is also used.

     DECKINCR   This option is no longer supported.

     (NO)DECKQ  This option  is used with DECK  to indicate that  the pu
              output may include ./ SEQUENCE (./ Q) control cards.  In s
              situations  an IEBUPDTE  compatible deck  cannot be  produ
              (e.g.   insertion prior  to  the first  card  of an  exist
              member); DECKQ would punch a SEQUENCE control card, otherw
              an error message would be produced.

     (NO)GANG Specifies that all cards inserted or  added to SYSUT2 (or
              master)  as a result of commands interpreted within an upd
              file are  to have  the significant  portion of  the SSI,
              printable hexadecimal form, placed ending in column 71.  T
              PARM option  is equivalent  to supplying  a ./  GANG CODE=
              statement after each CHANGE card. You may temporarily spec
              a different  GANG operation  within a  member update  via
              GANG detail  control card,   but cannot  cancel gang-punch
              with  a null  GANG statement.   At PID,   if the  signific
              portion of  the SSI is five  bytes,  the code is  placed i
              columns 66/70, not 67/71. Failure to provide SSI for the G
              operation does not cause the update to fail unless COND=0.

     (NO)IMPLS   causes  the  old   and  new  masters  to   be  treated
              unsequenced.  Data  contained in columns 73/80  are preser
              during  the  update.   Sequence  numbers  refer  to  impli
              position of old cards (e.g.  INSERT SEQ1=5 would insert af
              the fifth old master card).  This option may not be used w
              SEQID or NOINTEGER.

     INCR=1   Resets the default  increment to be used  if left unspecif
              on control statements. This default is used on detail cont
              functions  (such as  INSERT).   It is  not  used on  funct
              statements such as CHANGE or ADD, unless NEW1 is specified

     INDD=SYSU    Specifies the DDNAME of the old master file.   The mas
              input file  is specified  using the SYSUT1  or INDD  DD ca
              Input files may be switched between  commands by using a P
              of INDD with the desired alternate  DD name.  Input files
              be  concatenated providing  all concatenated  files have
              same  DCB  parameters  (other   than  the  blocksize).   W
              compatible files differ  only in the blocksize,   the data
              with the largest blocksize should be specified first,  or
              largest blocksize should be specified on the first DD card
              the concatenation.

     (NO)INSER   When INSERT is specified,  columns 73/80 on INSERTed ca
              are treated as blank no matter what they contain.  Otherwi
              they are checked and,  if non-blank,  used as IEBUPDTE cha
              data records ("data statements").

     (NO)INTEGER
     (NO)INT  Specifies that sequence numbers are  present in columns 73
              (except for  RECFM=V files).  The negation  NOINTEGER appl
              only to  files in WYLBUR EDIT  format.   When NOINT  is us
              WYLBUR line  numbers will be  used as sequence  numbers;
              vice versa for output data sets in WYLBUR edit format.

     LIBDD=SYS    Specifies the default  for DDNAME= on ./ COPY  or ./ L
              commands,  and  the DDNAME  of the library  used by  ./ MA
              commands.   When no SYSLIB DD is present, and a SYSUT1 PDS
              present, it will be used instead;  if neither is present,
              SYSUT2 is a PDS,  it will  be used.  This replacement is d

              only  at program  start  time;   subsequent specification
              LIBDD=SYSLIB may not work.

     (NO)LISTA    This option  was added  for compatibility  with IEBUPD
              which  lists  the output  of  ADD  functions whether  or
              LIST=ALL is specified on the ADD statement.

     (NO)LISTA    This option,  when set,  acts as though LISTADD,  LIST
              and LISTRN had been turned on. Unless NOLISTING is specifi
              all changes  to a member,  except  those due to  recursive
              chained updates, are listed.

     (NO)LISTD    Causes all deleted  records to be listed.   Default is
              list any deleted  cards.  If LISTLEV is  not specified,  o
              cards deleted by SYSIN controls  will be listed.   Old mas
              records  altered  by  FIX  or  SCAN  are  considered  dele
              records.

     (NO)LISTI    Specifies that a  listing of update commands  and data
              to be  provided under  control of  the other  LISTxxx opti
              (default is  LISTING).  NOLISTING  suppresses all  other L
              options,  and will  list only major commands  and messages
              the print file.  The listing generated by the LOAD command
              suppressed, and the LIST=ALL option on function statements
              ignored.

     (NO)LISTL    Tells  the program  to  list  insertions (deletions,
              applicable) caused by all intermediate update decks.  Defa
              is to list only changes caused by SYSIN.

     (NO)LISTR   Causes   listing  of   statements   which  were   forci
              renumbered  due to  INSERT  and  REPLACE operations.   Unl
              LISTLEV is also on,  only renumbering triggered by inserti
              from SYSIN are listed.

     MOD      Provided  for  compatibility  with  IEBUPDTE.   When  MOD
              specified,  ADD operations  (but not REPL)  will  fail if
              specified  member already  exists in  the  new master.   T
              option  is not  the  default,  PARM=NEW  is.   When CHAIN
                         ___
              specified, PARM=MOD is ignored.

     (NO)NAMES  Specifies  that control  statements have  name fields  (
              thus  the blank(s)   following  the  "./" and  preceding
              command word are required). If the default (NONAMES) is us
              the blanks  may be omitted,  but  if the name field  is us
              NAMES must be specified.

     NEW      This option (the default)  specifies that ADD operations w
              be treated as  REPL;  i.e.  an ADD operation  will replace
              identically named member in the new master. The option can
              negated with PARM=MOD unless PARM=CHAIN is specified also.

     OUTDD=SYS    Specifies the DDNAME of the New  Master data set.  It
              be changed  any time  between major  function commands.
              DDNAME  beginning  with SYS  may  be  used.   Note  that
              operating  system   imposes  certain  restrictions   on  t
              facility for sequential datasets. INDD and OUTDD should ne
              specify the same sequential dataset; the program may abend
              the input data could be lost. When OUTDD is used to respec
              a previously used DDNAME (sequential or member of a PDS),
              output from  the prior use could  be lost unless  DISP=MOD
              used on the DD (not allowed for PDS members).

     (NO)RUN  This option is an abbreviation of WYLRUN.

     (NO)SEQFI   This option, when specified,  causes too small SEQ2 fie
              to be filled by digit replacement from SEQ1;  e.g.  ./ INS
              SEQ1=123,SEQ2=5 is  normally invalid  (SEQ2 less  than SEQ
              SEQFIX  fills   leading  blanks  in   the  SEQ2   value  f
              corresponding SEQ1 positions.   Thus the above case  would
              treated as  SEQ1=123,SEQ2=125.  This option is  not genera
              recommended  due to  the  fashion  in which  IEBUPDTX  par
              commands. When positional operands are used, IEBUPDTX dete
              the end of an operand as any special character lower than
              in the collating sequence (e.g. / - .  etc.).  Many keyboa
              contain special  characters in  the upshifted  or downshif
              position on the  same keys as digits;  e.g.   ./ INSERT 12
              could be punched as  ./ INSERT 123/5 if the shift  key is
              depressed.

     (NO)SSI
     SSI=DATE
     SSI=hex  When SSI is not specified on ADD and CHANGE commands, it w
              be used from the SSI PARM option,  if that was used.  At P
              SSI=DATE is the  default,  and generates an SSI  field of
              form 000yyddd.    This matches  the action  of a  WYLBUR S
              command.  Any user SSI may  be specified;  the value suppl
              must consist  of one to  eight hexadecimal digits.   The f
              SSI= is treated as SSI=DATE.  The SSI field is always pres
              in a directory  entry generated with CHAINing.    See the
              operand under ADD or CHANGE for details.

     (NO)TIMES  STOWs a time  stamp in the SYSUT2 directory  of all CHAN
              or ADDED  members in the form  (4 bytes =  YYDDDHH+).  Unl
              SSI,  this option always requires an additional four bytes
              directory space per member.

              During  initialization,  IEBUPDTX  will attempt  to open
              unidentified DD  for additional  input,  unless  the file

              prevent problems, you may specify that only DD cards start
              with a specific  character string are to be  treated as in
              files.   The common prefix is  specified on UPDATES=pfx,
              may be one to eight characters  long,  and may not start w
              SYS.  Before you invoke IEBUPDTX from a TSO terminal sessi
              you should free any previously  allocated files which are
              to be used  by IEBUPDTX.  When this option is  used,  it m
              appear on the EXEC PARM.

     (NO)USER
     USER=name  Specifies the external name of  a global user exit routi
              or cancels it. See Section 7.2 for details.

     (NO)WYLBU  Allows the SYSIN control stream to have WYLBUR line numb
              in columns 73/80.   IEBUPDTX ignores the WYLBUR  line numb
              for updating  purposes,  but prints them  at the left  of
              command in the  output listing.  Only card  images from SY
              are treated in this way.   Note  that any contents in colu
              73/80 is ignored;  hence you may not use this option when
              have "data statements" (cards  with explicit sequence numb
              in 73/80).  See WYLRUN below for an alternative.  The prob
              may  also be  avoided by  issuing  the RUN  command with
              UNNumbered or JCLNUM options.

     (NO)WYLRU  This option is the PID  default.  It specifies that colu
              73/80 of input cards are to be  left as is unless they app

     1.2   FILES
           _____

     The source data to be updated (that is, changed in any way)  is cal
     the OLD MASTER. The set of data cards describing the update to be m
     is called the CONTROL FILE. The data formed as a result of the acti
     specified in the control file form  the NEW MASTER data set.  IEBUP
     performs updating  by copying data  from old  master to new  master
     directed  via the  control  file(s).  Source  cards  may be  insert
     deleted, or edited.

     For purposes  of this document,  it  will be assumed that  the cont
     file is presented to the update  program through the file described
     the SYSIN  Data Definition statement (OS  JCL DD statement).   The
     master data set, wherever required,  must be provided under the DDN
     SYSUT1 and the new master data set, if one is to be generated, must
     described by a DD statement with DDNAME  SYSUT2.  This is not the c
     if data set associations are being  dynamically controlled by the I
     and OUTDD PARM options described in Section 1.1.

                  +------+     +-------+     +------+
                  ×      ×     ×       ×     ×      ×
                  ×  old ×  +  ×control×  =  ×  new ×

                  +------+     +-------+     +------+
                   SYSUT1        SYSIN        SYSUT2

     The updating  capabilities of IEBUPDTX  apply to  logically sequent
     old master  data sets,   and the  program will  update from  SYSUT1
     SYSUT2 if they are simple sequential files. IEBUPDTX will also oper
     correctly if  either or  both of  SYSUT1 and  SYSUT2 are  PDSs with
     requiring  any change  to  the control  statements  in SYSIN,   exc
     possibly to specify the member name.   If SYSUT1 and SYSUT2 both po
     to the same  PDS,  IEBUPDTX will automatically replace  the old mas
     with the new master if the update is completed without errors.

     Note that use  of MACRO may produce output that  cannot be reproces
     by either IEBUPDTX or IEBUPDTE,  and  may result in unusable data w
     output is written in WYLBUR format  without the INTEGER option.   W
     output is  sequential (sequential dataset  or a PDS  member),  simi
     considerations apply when more than  one ADD/CHANGE operation is us
     or when  the file  appears more  than once  on an  OUTDD PARM  requ
     (counting the implicit OUTDD=SYSUT2 from the EXEC PARM).

        1   Job Card. See the PID User's Guide for details.

        2   HASP control  cards.  Note that  updates to  permanent files
            usually produce incorrect results when  they are rerun.  The
            PID /*NORERUN card  (system default)  serves as  a reminder.
            For updates  to temporary or semi-permanent  files,  /*RERUN
            may be used when it is  safe.   The /*SETUP (or a /*NOSETUP)
            card is required to specify tape or disk volumes required by
            the following JCL. A /*FETCH request may be added for WYLBUR
            users, as may a /*NOTIFY userid.

        3   EXEC PGM=IEBUPDTX - Additional  information may be specified
            with the  PARM parameter or with  the ./ PARM  command.  See
            Section 1.1 for PARM options. The required REGION depends on
            the file blocksizes,  the number of DD cards and the type of
            request (e.g.  FIX or SCAN).  Undemanding requests might run
            in as little as 64K; most simple updates (SYSUT1/SYSUT2 with
            BLKSIZE=3120)  run in 80K.    When REGION=128K is specified,
            the actual region billed is the larger of 64K and the amount
            used.

        4   SYSUT1  - Old  Master  data set.   Required  only if  CHANGE
            commands actually refer  to it for original  source records.
            May  be sequential  or  partitioned,   with (a)   optionally
            blocked  80 byte  fixed length  records,   (b)  WYLBUR  edit
            format, or (c) TSO RECFM=VB format.

        5   SYSUT2  -  New Master  data  set.   This file  is  generally
            required.  SYSUT2 may be sequential or partitioned, with (a)
            optionally blocked 80 byte fixed length records, (b)  WYLBUR
            edit format,  or  (c)  TSO RECFM=VB format.   Card format is
            assumed when the RECFM parameter has  not been set,  or is F
            or FB.  WYLBUR format is used when  the RECFM is U,  and the






                             IEBUPDTX User's Guide
     Introduction


            output device is  tape or disk;  other device  types are not
            supported with RECFM=U. TSO RECFM=VB format is used when the
            RECFM is V or VB;  a specification  of VBS is treated as VB.
            If BLKSIZE  is omitted,   the program  defaults the  size by
            device type (8000  for tape,  80 for unit  record,  3120 for
            3330, etc.).

        6   SYSPRINT - Listing  data set,  always required.   If omitted
            IEBUPDTX  terminates with  return  code  16.  This  file  is
            written with DCB=(RECFM=VBM).

        7   SYSPUNCH -  DECK data set.  Required  only if the  PARM DECK
            option is specified. SYSPUNCH may have any of the attributes
            valid for SYSUT2.

        8   SYSLIB - COPY library. Required only if LIST, COPY, or MACRO
            commands reference  it.  Must  be a PDS  with 80  byte fixed
            length records (optionally blocked), WYLBUR edit format,  or
            TSO RECFM=VB format.

        9   SYSUBEND - SNAP  data set.  If this DDNAME  is present,  the
            program will produce a SNAP dump with each error message.

        10  INTERMEDIATE UPDATE  FILES.  An intermediate update  file is
            provided to IEBUPDTX by using  any DDNAME that doesn't begin
            with "SYS" to describe it.  These files may be sequential or
            partitioned, with either optionally blocked 80 byte records,
            WYLBUR edit format, or TSO RECFM=VB format. The intermediate
            update data sets should contain  valid IEBUPDTX update decks
            which will be  considered to apply logically  between SYSUT1
            and SYSIN in TIOT sequence. In such cases, SYSUT1 is updated
            by  the  intermediate  update,  whose  output  becomes  "old
            master" to the  next update or SYSIN.  Also  see the UPDATES
            PARM option.

        11  SYSIN - Master control file.   Generally required to provide
            the main source  of control statements to  the program,  but
            may be omitted if the update can be performed using the last
            intermediate update control file in  the JCL.  In that case,
            the intermediate update file must be sequential, and is used
            as SYSIN.  SYSIN must be sequential,  with either optionally
            blocked fixed length 80 byte records, WYLBUR edit format, or
            TSO RECFM=VB format.

     Any  non-SYS files  are  considered to  be  intermediate update  fi
     except the obvious ones (STEPLIB,  etc.).  Any other SYS DDNAME may
     used for the DDNAME  control on COPY operations or the  OUTDD and I
     PARM options.  To save storage or time, BUFNO may be specified for
     file  via  the DCB  parameter  on  the  DD  card.  Note  that  chai
     scheduling is used on all non-print files.

     1.4   IEBUPDTX CONTROL STATEMENTS
           ________ _______ __________

     There are two general types of control statements in IEBUPDTX:

                      Function statements
                      Detail Statements

     Function statements  are used to  initiate an  update and may  be u
     alone or accompanied by detail  Statements.  Detail statements may
     be  used  alone but  must  be  used  in  conjunction with  a  funct
     statement,  usually a  CHANGE statement,  for each data  set.  In t
     document the detail statements are covered in two sections, with ba
     detail  statements in  Section  3 and  extended  detail statements
     Section 4.    Function statements are described  in Sections 2  and
     The two function  statements (ADD and CHANGE)  described  in Sectio
     are basic  statements which precede  the detail statements.    Tabl
     shows the hierarchy of control statements.

     1.5   COMMAND SYNTAX
           _______ ______

     IEBUPDTX commands are written in a manner similar to assembly langu
     macro calls. The general format is:

     +------------------------------------------------------------------
     ×
     ×   ./namefield   operation   positional-operands,keyword-operands
     ×
     +------------------------------------------------------------------

     ./       must be present in columns 1/2 (but refer to PARM=CTL)

     Name field
              is not allowed unless the NAMES  PARM option is selected (
              NAMES option is provided for compatibility with IEBUPDTE,
              is not  the default).   This implies that  the name  field
              generally not to be used.    When the NONAME option (defau
              is in effect,  the omission of the name need not be indica
              by  leaving a  blank before  the  operation field,   altho
              leaving blanks  is allowed.   PARM options  are discussed
              Section 1.1.

     Operation
              contains an  IEBUPDTX control  statement,  either  a funct
              statement (such as  CHANGE),  or a detail  statement (such
              INSERT).

     Operands
              may  contain both  positional and  keyword  operands.  As
              assembly language,  any positionally  specified operands m
              precede any and all keywords.  No embedded blanks are allo
              as  the first  blank  starts  the comments  field.   Requi
              operands  are shown  in this  manual in  braces (¯ò),   wh
              optional operands are shown in brackets ([]). Each command
              presented in two formats:  the first format shows all keyw
              operands  while   the  second  format  shows   all  allowa
              positional  operands.  An  operand  that  is a  keyword  o
              appears in both formats as a keyword operand.   Table 4 sh
              which operands are allowed for  which commands,  and what
              order of their positional operands is.


        Positional Operands
              are separated by commas or  by dashes to improve readabili
              Omitted positional parameters must be designated by a comm

              Unlike  assembly language,   many operands  may be  specif
              either positionally  or as keywords.  For  compatibility w
              IEBUPDTE,  all operands may be specified as keywords altho
              not all  operands may be  specified positionally.  A  list
              allowed positional operands may be found in Table 4.

        Keyword Operands
              follow any positional  operands and are separated  by comm
              Dashes may not be used  as separators.  All IEBUPDTX opera
              may be specified as keywords.  No embedded blanks are allo
              as the first blank starts the comment field.

     Continuation
              Continuation statements  are indicated by following  the l
              keyword by a comma.  A statement ending with a comma follo
              by a  blank indicates a  continuation card.   No continuat
              character is checked for in  column 72.  Splitting an oper
              at  column 72  as in  assembly  language or  IEBUPDTE is
              allowed. The second card of the continuation must contain
              ./ in  columns 1/2,   and the  continued data  must begin
              column 16.   ADD and CHANGE cards within the scope of a LO
              and RESTORE  cards may not  be continued.  Special  rules
              continuation apply to the CFIX, CSCAN, FIX and SCAN cards.

              Comments may  be placed following  the operands by  leavin
              blank,  except on the RESTORE  statement,  where comments
              not  allowed.   In  addition,   a NOTE  card  functions as
              comments card.

     Line Numbers:
              Line numbers may be expressed by their right-most digits.
              example, SEQ1=10 is equivalent to SEQ1=00000010.  SEQ1=ALL
              also allowed to indicate the entire file.  END can be used
              any range;  100/END  indicates line number 100  to  the  l
              line,  inclusive.  The  short form 10K,  12K may  be used
              10000,   12000   etc.   throughout  IEBUPDTX.    All  nume
              parameters,  with  the exception of  ALL and END,   specif
              character (maximum)  decimal numbers.  ALL may be used on
              SEQUENCE and  NUMBER commands  to specify  the first  to l
              cards, inclusive.

     Name
              The operand  NAME=name is  synonymous with  MEMBER=name.
              MEMBER= form does not necessarily imply a PDS. It may be u
              for a library member name or  for a sequential data set.
              member  name operand  is optional  only when  all of  SYSU
              SYSUT2 and  SYSPUNCH (with the  DECK option)   are sequent
              datasets.

     Format:
              IEBUPDTX updates data in 80  column card images.   Through
              this  manual,  the  terms  "statement"  and "card"  are  u
              interchangeably.  "data statement" is used to describe a c
              which has  sequence numbers in  columns 73/80,  and  does
              have control  bytes "./" in columns  1/2.  This type  of c
              acts  as  an INSERT  or  REPLACE  of  a  single card  at
              specified sequence  number,  unless the  INSERT option  is
              effect.

     SSI      The System Status Information field consists of four bytes
              data in the variable portion of  a PDS directory entry.  W
              chaining is used,  the field is always present,  otherwise
              is optional.  The field is used by IBM for its source modu
              to denote modification status.  With  WYLBUR datasets,  it
              used to store the date of the last addition or change, in
              form  000yyddd.  At  PID,  SSI  is inserted  by default  (
              PARM=SSI).   Note  that several utility programs  provided
              PID have  special provision  for SSI  in date  format;  th
              include PUNK and WYLVTOC.

     Sequencing

     Sequence numbers  are 8  character decimal  numbers in  columns 73/
     Sequence numbers  must be  present in  the old  master card  images
     order to do an update,  unless WYLBUR format with the NOINTEGER opt
     is used (see Section 7.1),  or the  IMPLSEQ option is used.   The c
     images may be sequenced  when the old master is built,   or as part
     the  update  process.   There  are   several  ways  of  sequencing
     resequencing source:  the SEQUENCE and  NUMBER statements and the I
     and  NEW1 operands  on the  ADD or  CHANGE  statement may  be used
     sequence an entire  member;  the INCR and NEW1 operands  on the INS
     and REPLACE  commands may be used  to resequence inserted  or repla
     portions of a deck.

     It is good practice to select a relatively large increment if frequ
     updates  are expected.   This leaves  "room" to  insert cards  with
     resequencing parts  of the old  master each  time;  and it  allows
     methods of inserting cards, both of which are described in section
     under the INSERT command.

     Table  5  compares the  effects  of  sequencing by  various  comman
     Throughout  this manual,   the operands  INCR  and NEW1  are used
     sequencing:

     INCR     refers to  the numbering  increment used  for sequencing
              cards.  The default  is 1 or whatever is defined  as the I
              PARM option.

     NEW1     sets the sequence  number for the first card  to be sequen
              or  resequenced.   The  default is  INCR  plus  the  previ
              sequence number. If there is no previous sequence number,
              default is INCR.

     The effect of sequencing varies with the command.  If neither INCR
     NEW1  is coded  on  ADD or  CHANGE  (or on  SEQUENCE  or NUMBER),
     numbering is done. If neither INCR nor NEW1 is coded on the REPLACE
     INSERT  detail  statements,  as  much  numbering  as is  necessary
     accommodate inserted cards will be done. The defaults used will be
     for both cases (since INCR defaults to 1 and NEW1 defaults to INCR)

                              FUNCTION STATEMENTS


     This section  is concerned with  two operations  to be performed  o
     data set as a whole.  At least one function statement must be provi
     for each PDS member  or data set to be processed.   The detail cont
     statements,  described later  on,  may not be used  without a funct
     statement, usually the CHANGE statement.

     To simplify the following discussion, assume that both the new and
     master data reside in a PDS.  If either is a sequential data set,
     update  will   operate  accordingly.   Abbreviations   and  synonym
     commands, if any, are in parentheses following the command.

     2.1   ADD  (A,REPL)
           ___   _ ____

     Before an update  can be performed,  the original source  data must
     placed in the old master PDS as  a unique member with the ADD comma
     The alternative would be to input  the original cards every time.
     data cards which are to comprise the  new member should follow the
     command in SYSIN.  If all original source is provided by ADD comman
     SYSUT1 need not be specified.

     A REPL statement may be used instead of ADD. It is synonymous with
     if PARM=NEW is used (default),  or  when chaining is in effect.   W
     PARM=MOD is  chosen,  and the output  is partitioned,  ADD  will ca
     termination of the update when the  specified member already exists
     the new master.

     SSI      is a code of  up to 8 hex digits,  assumed  by IEBUPDTX to
              right justified, or the word DATE which results in a value
              the form 000yyddd.  Specifies that the PDS directory inclu
              four bytes  of SSI  data.  If SYSUT2  is not  a PDS,   SSI
              ignored.  If SYSUT1 is a PDS with SSI in its directory, it
              retained  for use  in  the SYSUT2  directory.    Once SSI
              specified,  it can not be removed by subsequent CHANGE car
              but it  may be modified.  The  default SSI is either  the
              provided by the previous update level, the SSI specified o
              PARM, or x'FF200000' if necessary.

     When the original old master source data is being built, it is usua
     desirable to sequence the cards. If the member is to be updated lat
     the sequence  numbers must be present  on the old master  card imag
     Sequence numbers are  placed in card columns 73/80  unless the INTE
     option is not used (see Section 7.1).   Sequencing may be performed
     the INCR and NEW1 parameters on the ADD, CHANGE,  INSERT,  and REPL
     cards.  It may also be done by the SEQUENCE or NUMBER detail statem
     described in Section  3.   Specifying either INCR or NEW1  on the A
     CHANGE,  SEQUENCE or NUMBER commands  results in complete resequenc
     of the member. If neither INCR nor NEW1 is specified, no sequencing
     done.  Sequencing is  required when the new master will  be written
     WYLBUR edit format using WYLBUR line numbers (see Section 7.1).

     INCR     specifies the numbering increment to  be used to sequence
              cards in  the new  master.  The  default is  1.   If  INCR
              specified in the  PARM options,  then that value  will be
              default.

     NEW1     specifies sequence number to be used  for the first card.
              most commands the default value is INCR+the previous seque
              number. In this case since it is an ADD, there is no previ
              sequence, so the default for NEW1 is the value of INCR.

     SEQID    Sequence field  identification creates an alphabetic  code
              be placed  on each  card image  starting in  column 73.
              actual sequence  number then  begins in  column 73+length
              SEQID.

              The SEQID field is handled  automatically by IEBUPDTX.   O
              the first old master card in  SYSUT1 is examined for a SEQ
              If one is found, all old master cards from SYSUT1 have zer
              placed over the SEQID for the  update process.  When any c
              is  subsequently  written  out  to   SYSUT2,   the  SEQID
              automatically replaced starting in column 73.

              SEQID requires the INTEGER option (see Section 7.1).

     LIST=ALL produces  a listing  of the  data  read by  the ADD  funct
              unless the NOLISTING PARM option  is requested.   Omission
              LIST=ALL still produces a listing  if PARM options LISTALL
              LISTADD (default) are in effect.

           ______   _ _____ _____

     To  change (or  update)  the  old master,   the CHANGE  card is  us
     followed by  detail control  commands which specify  the update  to
     made.  The detail control statements are:  ALIAS, COPY,  DELETE,  F
     GANG, INSERT, LOCATE, MACRO, NOTE, NUMBER,  REPLACE,  SCAN,  SEQUEN
     They are fully discussed  in the next section.  In the  absence of
     detail statements,   the old master is  copied unchanged into  the
     master file.  Unless the NOINTEGER PARM is used (see Section 7.1),
     old master must be sequenced before the update process,  or complet
     resequenced by  the update itself.  Otherwise,   the job fails  and
     updating  will be  done.    Complete resequencing  may  be  done by
     SEQUENCE or NUMBER statement,  or by the INCR,  NEW1 parameters on
     ADD or CHANGE cards.

     The CHANGE command is written in much the same way as the ADD comma
     the member name (if provided) is used to locate the old master data
     SYSUT1 (if a PDS)   as well as to store the new  master data in SYS
     (if a PDS).   The  name is also required when the  DECK option is u
     and SYSPUNCH is a PDS.

     NAME     is the name of the member to be changed

     VERSION  is discussed in Section 6.1.

     SSI      is a code of  up to 8 hex digits,  assumed  by IEBUPDTX to
              right justified, or the word DATE which results in a value
              the form 000yyddd.  Specifies that the PDS directory inclu
              four bytes  of SSI  data.  If SYSUT2  is not  a PDS,   SSI
              ignored.  If SYSUT1 is a PDS with SSI in its directory, it
              retained  for use  in  the SYSUT2  directory.    Once SSI
              specified,  it can not be removed by subsequent CHANGE car
              but it  may be modified.  The  default SSI is either  the
              provided by the previous update level, the SSI specified o
              PARM, or x'FF200000' if necessary.

              When the SSI is specified with fewer than 8 characters, it
              right-justified and  overlays the  right-most portion  of
              prior SSI (or the default); e.g.  SSI=1234 would default t
              value of  FF201234 (the  FF20 is  the default  if SSI  is
              available from any other source).  At PID, the default SSI
              the date in the form 000yyddd,   thus the above example mi
              result in 00081234.

     INCR     specifies  the  numbering  sequence which  will  be  used
              resequence the cards. Using INCR on the CHANGE card specif
              complete resequencing of a member.

     NEW1     specifies the sequence number to be  used for the first ca
              The default value  is INCR+the previous sequence  number.
              there is no  previous sequence number (such as  when a mem
              is ADDed) the default is the value of INCR.

     SEQID    changes the  alphabetic code placed on  each card by  the
              card,  starting in  col 73.  The actual  sequence number t
              begins in col 73+length of SEQID.

              Some caution must be used when coding SEQID on a CHANGE ca
              The length  of the SEQID may  be increased but should  not
              made  so long  that it  overlaps  any non-zero  digit of
              sequence number.   SEQID=0  may be coded to  indicate that
              sequence id is desired for the new master.  This special c
              allows the program to remove the  SEQID from the SYSUT1 ca
              automatically.  See discussion of SEQID under the ADD comm
              for more comments.

              SEQID requires the INTEGER option (see Section 7.1).

     LIST=ALL invokes a  listing of  the new  master source  data as  it
              written to SYSUT2.  If LIST=ALL is not specified,  only ca
              which are changed from old master to new are listed.

     NEWNAME  specifies the name to be applied to the new master.   This
              particularly helpful when SYSUT1 and SYSUT2 are the same P
              NEWNAME= is valid only for a  PDS and only in SYSIN.  NEWN
              is not supported when chaining is used.


     Example :

             ./ CHANGE HASPINIT,LIST=ALL

     signals that  changes are  to be  made to  HASPINIT;  the  inserted
     modified statements are to be numbered in increments of 1, the defa
     starting with the previous  sequence number + 1.  If INCR  is coded
     the PARM field,  the default increment  would be that value.   The
     master source is to  be listed.  SEQID will be used  if the old mas
     had SEQID.  If SEQID=0 had been coded,   the SEQID from the old mas
     would not be used.

                               DETAIL STATEMENTS


     Detail statements are used to modify  the operation initiated by a
     or  CHANGE command,   by  defining  the nature  of  the  update to
     performed.  A range of card images may be deleted, inserted, replac
     or renumbered.   Changes to  character strings may  be performed  o
     range of card images.  Detail statements  must be arranged in order
     increasing sequence numbers of records being updated.

     3.1   SEQUENCE (Q)
           ________  _

     SEQUENCing may be specified with this SEQUENCE command,  with a NUM
     command,  or as a parameter on  the ADD,  CHANGE,  INSERT,  or REPL
     commands.

     The first  SEQUENCE card immediately follows  the ADD or  CHANGE ca
     and precedes the actual  data to be added.  The format  of the comm
     is:

     +------------------------------------------------------------------
     ×
     ×   ./ SEQUENCE INCR=incr,NEW1=new1
     ×
     ×   ./ SEQUENCE incr,new1
     ×
     +------------------------------------------------------------------

     At least one of INCR or NEW1 must be coded or no renumbering is don

     INCR     specifies  the numbering  increment  which  will be  used
              sequence the cards. If card x has sequence number x, card
              will have sequence number x+INCR.   The default value of I
              is 1 unless a different value has  been coded for INCR in
              PARM statement.

     NEW1     sets the sequence number to be  used for the first card.
              default is the value of  INCR+the previous sequence number
              the value of INCR if there is no previous sequence number.

     The  sequencing   may  be  dynamically   modified  by   placing  ot
     ./ SEQUENCE commands among the source cards.  Sequence numbers must
     assigned in increasing order. Erroneous NEW1 values will be rejecte

     It is  good practice  to choose  a relatively  large increment  if
     expects to  do frequent updates.  This  leaves "room" to  insert ca
     without resequencing parts of the old master each time. It also all
     the use of two methods of inserting cards.  See the description of
     INSERT command in Section 3.4.

     IEBUPDTX  provides the  ability to  define  the default  INCR used
     SEQUENCE, NUMBER, INSERT,  and REPLACE detail control commands and
     ADD and CHANGE function control statements.  To define a default, c
     INCR=incr as one of the PARM options,   where incr is a decimal num
     greater than zero.  This will  override the built-in default increm
     of one.  This and  other PARM options are discussed in  Section 1.1
     this manual.

     3.2   NUMBER  (N,NUMBR)
           ______   _ _____

     The ./ NUMBER command is provided  for IEBUPDTE compatibility.  It
     two forms :

        * Used without INSERT=YES, it renumbers all or selected portions
          of  the  input  (with  ADD/REPL),  or  the  old  master  (with
          CHANGE/REPRO).   The function is similar to ./ SEQUENCE, but a
          start and end sequence may be specified. Used in this fashion,
          the  first ./  NUMBER statement  must  immediately follow  the
          ADD/CHANGE statement.

        * When used with INSERT=YES, it acts like the ./ INSERT command.

     +------------------------------------------------------------------
     ×
     ×   ./ NUMBER  ¯SEQ1=seq1ò[,SEQ2=seq2,INCR=incr,NEW1=new1,
     ×                  INSERT=YES]
     ×   ./ NUMBER  ¯seq1ò[,seq2,incr,new1,INSERT=YES]
     ×
     +------------------------------------------------------------------

     SEQ1     specifies the first card to be renumbered. ALL may be used
              specify an entire member.  When specifying ALL, omit seq2
              mark its place  with a comma if  it is not the  last opera
              For example, NUMBER ALL,,incr.

     SEQ2     specifies the last card in the range to be renumbered.

     INCR     same as in the sequence command.

     NEW1     same as in the sequence  command.  Like the sequence comma
              at least one of INCR and NEW1 must be coded.

     INSERT=YE   distinguishes  an  insert operation  from  a  resequenc
              operation.

     For compatibility  with IEBUPDTE,  the NUMBER  command may be  used
     insert or  renumber a  range of  the old  master.  That  usage is
     encouraged  as it  is better  to  leave the  original source  seque
     numbers as a common base from which to work.

     3.3   DELETE  (D,DELET)
           ______   _ _____

     The DELETE detail statement  is used to delete one or  more cards f
     the old master.   The cards deleted are simply not  transcribed to
     new  master   -  they  remain  intact   in  the  old   master  (unl
     SYSUT1=SYSUT2).

     ×
     ×   ./ DELETE ¯seq1ò[,seq2]
     ×
     +------------------------------------------------------------------

     SEQ1     specifies the  beginning of  the range of  card images  to
              deleted.

     SEQ2     specifies the  last card  image to  be deleted.   If SEQ2
              omitted,  or if  SEQ2=SEQ1,  a single card  image,  SEQ1,
              deleted. SEQ2=END may be specified to delete from SEQ1 to
              end of the deck.

     Example 1:

               ./ DELETE 200-280 or
               ./ DELETE SEQ1=200,SEQ2=280

     cause all old master records with sequence numbers between 200 and
     to be deleted.   If  records 200 and 280 do not  actually exist in
     old master, a warning message is produced.

     Example 2:

              ./ DELETE 200,200 or
              ./ DELETE 200

     deletes the single card with sequence number of 200.

     3.4   INSERT  (I)
           ______   _

     To add new cards to the old  master,  the INSERT command is used.
     new cards  being INSERTed  will be  assigned new  sequence numbers
     IEBUPDTX, and must not contain any punches in columns 73/80. The ca
     are inserted after some existing card  image in the old master,  wh
     sequence number is provided on the INSERT command.

     The INSERT command  must be immediately followed by the  data cards
     be inserted,  or  one of five detail statements  (COPY,  GANG,  MAC
     NUMBER or SEQUENCE). The insert command is terminated when either a
     statement other than  the special ones,  or a card  with any non-bl
     characters in columns 73/80 is encountered.

     Inserted cards  are listed  whether or  not LIST=ALL  is coded  on
     CHANGE card. LIST=ALL causes all new master source to be listed.


     +------------------------------------------------------------------
     ×
     ×   ./ INSERT ¯SEQ1=seq1ò,[INCR=incr,NEW1=new1]
     ×
     ×   ./ INSERT ¯seq1ò[,incr,new1]
     ×
     +------------------------------------------------------------------

     SEQ1     indicates where  to insert the new  cards in the  old mast
              SEQ1=0 may  be used to  insert a card  at the beginning  o
              deck if there is no card 0.

     INCR     specifies the numbering increment.  INCR defaults to 1 unl
              a different value of INCR is coded in the PARM statement.

     NEW1     specifies  the sequence  number  to be  placed  on the  fi
              inserted card. NEW1 defaults to SEQ1+INCR.

     The  SEQUENCE command  may also  be  placed within  the records  be
     INSERTed to modify incr and new1 dynamically.

     Example 1:

        ./ INSERT 600,10
             data cards

     inserts the data cards into the new master, after card 600.  The fi
     card inserted is numbered 610 with subsequent cards numbered 620, 6
     etc.

     Single  cards may  be inserted  without  using the  INSERT command
     punching the  sequence numbers  they are to  have directly  in colu
     73/80.   For example,  if the old master contains cards  numbered
     20,  30,   etc.   a data card in the update deck with 00000025 punc
     in columns  73/80,  will be  inserted between cards  20 and 30  and

     numbered 25.   To insert in  this manner,   it is imperative  that
     number to be placed in columns 73/80 does not already exist in the
     master - if  it does,  the old  master card is DELETEd  before the
     card is inserted.

     The INSERT command must be used  whenever the number of cards inser
     exceeds the "room" left for them in the old master.  If the old mas
     is sequenced  in steps  of 1,  it  is impossible  to insert  using
     second method described.   However,  the INSERT command  may always
     used, since it automatically renumbers as much of the old master as
     necessary to accommodate  the cards inserted.  Therefore it  is a g
     idea to  use a  relatively large increment  when creating  old mast
     initially, to minimize the number of cards which need to be renumbe
     by subsequent insertions.

     Example 2:

     If the old master looks like:

                    OLD1                                         0000010
                    OLD2                                         0000010
                    OLD3                                         0000020

     and the update deck is the following:

      ./ CHANGE OLD
      ./ INSERT 100
                    AA
                    BB
                    CC
                    DD

     the result would be:

                    OLD1                                         0000010
                    AA                                           0000010
                    BB                                           0000010
                    CC                                           0000010
                    DD                                           0000010
                    OLD2                                         0000010
                    OLD3                                         0000020

     where card OLD2 has been renumbered to accommodate the inserted car

           _______  _

     Two possible ways to REPLACE one or  more cards in the old master w
     new data cards  have already been described.   One method is to  us
     combination DELETE and INSERT commands which IEBUPDTX allows in eit
     order. Another way is to punch the data on a card in columns 1/72 w
     the sequence number of the card to be replaced in columns 73/80.  T
     way can be very  time consuming.  The third way is  to use the REPL
     command.  The data to be inserted  must immediately follow the REPL
     command in SYSIN and contain blanks in  columns 73/80 (just as for
     INSERT command).

     +------------------------------------------------------------------
     ×
     ×   ./ REPLACE ¯SEQ1=seq1ò[,SEQ2=seq2,INCR=incr,NEW1=new1]
     ×
     ×   ./ REPLACE ¯seq1ò[,seq2,incr,new1]
     ×
     +------------------------------------------------------------------

     SEQ1     specifies the first card to be replaced.

     SEQ2     specifies the  last card  in the range  to be  replaced.
              omitted, only one card is replaced (SEQ1).

     INCR     specifies the numbering increment for the inserted card. I
              defaults to  1 unless  a value  was coded  for the  INCR P
              option.

     NEW1     is the  sequence number  to be placed  on the  first inser
              card. The default is SEQ1.

     Example 1:
                ./ REPLACE 200-280
          or    ./ REPLACE SEQ1=200,SEQ2=280
          or    ./ R 200,280

     first deletes from 200 to 280 inclusive, and then inserts the new d
     with sequence numbers beginning at 200.

     The number of cards inserted need not equal those deleted.

     Example 2:
                ./ REPLACE 200,INCR=5
          or    ./ REPLACE 200,,5
          or    ./ REPLACE 200,,5,200
          or    ./ REPLACE SEQ1=200,INCR=5,NEW1=200
          or    ./ REPLACE 200,200,5,NEW1=200

     replaces card  200 with the  one or  more cards following  the REPL
     card in SYSIN.   If INCR had not  been specified as 5,   it would h
     defaulted to 1, and where NEW1 was not specified, it defaulted to 2

     Often it  is necessary to  replace an  entire card simply  because
     word on  it was  misspelled,  such  as an  assembly language  op-co

     string located anywhere  on a card or in specified  columns.  FIX w
     change the first  occurrence of the string in each  line.  The colu
     (COL)  option allows parts of a card such as the length of the oper
     to be changed while allowing the comments to start in the same colu
     CFIX operates the same as FIX,  but  does not raise an error condit
     when the FIX request is not matched.

     The syntax of the FIX command is

     +------------------------------------------------------------------
     ×
     ×   ./ FIX ¯SEQ1=seq1ò[,SEQ2=seq2,COL1=col1,COL2=col2]
     ×             ¯#badstring#goodstring#ò
     ×   ./ FIX ¯seq1ò[,seq2,col1,col2] ¯#badstring#goodstring#ò
     ×
     +------------------------------------------------------------------

     SEQ1     specifies the first card to be fixed.

     SEQ2     specifies the last card in the range to be fixed.

     COL1     specifies the first column to be  searched in the old mast
              The default value is  1.  COL1 must be less than  or equal
              COL2.  The COL options allow definition of the subfield wh
              is to be searched for the string.

     COL2     specifies  the last  column which  is to  be searched.
              default is 71. COL2 must be less than or equal to 72.

     #        represents any non-blank  character not a member  of the g
              or bad string.

     badstring  represents any string  from 1 to 32 characters  which is
              be  replaced.   At least  one  blank  must follow  the  ra
              specification and precede the bad string.

     goodstrin  represents any string from 0 to 32 characters.

     The FIX  operation operates  from columns  1/71 by  default,  so  t
     continuation characters  in column  72 will not  be affected.   If
     "good" string is shorter than the "bad"  string,  the right end of
     resulting record is padded with blanks. If the "good" string is lon
     than the "bad" string, information to the right of the "bad" string
     shifted to the right.  If any information, other than blanks, is lo
     a warning message is given.

     Detail Statements


     Example 1:

               ./ FIX 2475 #LPR#LCR#

     directs the  update program to search  columns 1/71 of the  old mas
     card 2475 for the FIRST OCCURRENCE of  the string "LPR" and replace
     with the string "LCR".

     In the above example, the range consists of single card.

     The 'bad' and 'good' strings may  be of different lengths.  The 'go
     string may even be null.   It may  be necessary to specify more of
     string than just the part you want  replaced if there is more than
     occurrence of it in a line. Only the first occurrence of the specif
     string  on each  card  in  the range  is  affected.   To change  ev
     occurrence of a string, use the SCAN command.

     Example 2:

                ./ FIX 42,,10-15    /B/BE/ or
                ./ FIX 42,COL1=10,COL2=15   /B/BE/

     changes  an assembly  language mnemonic  from B  to BE  in columns
     through 15 of card 42. The second comma in the first FIX command ma
     the omitted positional parameter seq2.

     It is slightly more efficient to  specify columns when they are kno
     as this  minimizes the  amount of  searching required  by IEBUPDTX
     locate the "bad" string.


     The FIX  command is unusual  in that  it doesn't interfere  with ot
     update commands.  That is, you may specify more than one FIX active
     a given card,   or you may have a  FIX active on a range  of cards
     still  make  insertions  and deletions  within  the  range.   Howev
     inserted cards will not be FIXed.

     Due to  the special  format of the  FIX cards,  the  cards may  not
     continued once the sequence/column fields are specified.  When you
     using  long  strings,  continuation  may  be  done by  continuing
     sequence or column fields. For example :

      ./      FIX   100,200,1,
      ./ 71 #very long bad string#very long good string#

     where 1 and 71 are the default columns.

     string in the same line,  not just the first.  Thus,  SCAN is somew
     less efficient than FIX. The syntax is the same as for FIX.  When S
     causes no substitution to be made, the update is terminated. CSCAN
     be used instead of SCAN; it does not raise an error condition.

           ____   _

     Comments may  be placed  on update  commands by  placing at  least
     blank after the last operand and following  it with a comment.  If
     really have a lot to say, the NOTE detail command may be used:

           _____

     This  command   indicates  an  end  of   file  and  is   provided
     compatibility with IEBUPDTE.  It is optional  in most cases,  but m
     not be used with the LOAD function. In that case, it would be execu
     and  would terminate  the  update instead  of  being  loaded into
     library.

                          ADDITIONAL DETAIL STATEMENTS


     The  detail statements  described  in Section  3  were all  explici
     concerned with the update process.  The detail commands presented h
     provide services which do not affect the basic update in progress,
     may still be useful.  Like all detail statements, those described h
     must be used with CHANGE or ADD.

     4.1   ALIAS
           _____

     The ALIAS command modifies the CHANGE  or ADD command which it foll
     by specifying an  additional name by which the member  being stored
     SYSUT2 (PDS) may be referenced. The ALIAS command is written as

     +------------------------------------------------------------------
     ×
     ×   ./ ALIAS ¯NAME=nameò
     ×
     ×   ./ ALIAS ¯nameò

     A maximum of sixteen ALIAS cards may be used for any one ADD or CHA
     command.  With the CHAIN feature, only one ALIAS is permitted, and
     name must be the production member name.   An ALIAS card may be pla
     anywhere behind the ADD/CHANGE which it modifies, preferably after
     last detail card.

     4.2   GANG  (G)
           ____   _

     The GANG command provides a gang-punching  facility.  It allows you
     specify an  identification code  of up  to 8  alphanumeric characte
     This code  will be  placed in  each data  card inserted  into the
     master by  the update  deck in SYSIN,   or as a  result of  a SCAN/
     operation effected by SYSIN. Successive updates may have the same o
     different code.

     +------------------------------------------------------------------
     ×
     ×   ./ GANG [CODE=code,COL=col]
     ×
     ×   ./ GANG [code,col]
     ×
     +------------------------------------------------------------------

     code     is the string  to be gang-punched.  If code  is omitted,
              previous  GANG  operation  is   terminated.    When  GANG
              specified on a PARM, a GANG with no CODE operand restores
              GANG id specified on the PARM.

              Two special values may be supplied for CODE:  CODE=SSI cau
              the trailing non-zero  values of the current SSI  to be us
              e.g.  if the  SSI is 01234567,  the GANG id  is 1234567.
              specification of CODE=DATE results in  a 5-byte string of
              form "yyddd".

     COL      is the column in which the code is to begin.  If omitted,
              code is  placed in  (column 72  - code  length)  so  that
              ganged string ends in column 71.

     GANG is one of the few "./"  control cards which does not terminate
     INSERT operation, permitting the GANG to be altered at any time.

     For example:     ./ GANG CODE=23GS2032
     will place the code 23GS2032 on each card inserted beginning in col
     64 (72-code length of 8 = 64).

     The GANG CODE unconditionally overlays existing  data in a card ima
     Such an overlay is  flagged with either a G or an S  in the print l
     for the card.  To make GANG a little safer to use, the PARM option
     may be specified. When ASM is on:

        * GANG  is   not  applied  if   column  72  is   non-blank  (ASM
          continuation)

        * GANG is  not applied unless the  columns before and  after the
          code position are blank.

        * GANG is applied  when either the code field is  blank,  or the
          code length is 5 bytes,  and the old location is numeric.  The
          second option  is provided to  permit replacing  existing GANG
          information which uses GANG in date format (yyddd).

     4.3   COPY
           ____

     The COPY  command provides the ability  to enter data from  a separ
     library into SYSIN (except that COPYed data are not GANGed).  The d
     fetched as a result of a COPY command are taken from the PDS descri
     by the DDNAME operand.  The default DDNAME is SYSLIB, or SYSUT1 if
     is no SYSLIB, but the LIBDD PARM option may be used to specify anot
     default.  Copied data are not checked for ./ in columns 1/2. If suc
     "copy library" is  not provided,  IEBUPDTX will  terminate with ret
     code 12.

     COPY is valid without restriction under ADD,  but must be in the ra
     of  an active  INSERT or  REPLACE when  used under  CHANGE.  The  C
     command,  like GANG,  does not terminate an active INSERT.  When un
     CHANGE, the sequence field 73/80 is automatically blanked.

     ×   ./ COPY ¯nameò[,,fromseq,toseq,DDNAME=ddname]
     ×
     +------------------------------------------------------------------

     NAME     specifies a  member of SYSLIB  which is to  logically repl
              the COPY command in SYSIN.

     VERSION  is described in Section 6.1.

     FROMSEQ  specifies the first card to copy.  If omitted the COPY beg
              with the first card in the member.  FROMSEQ=0 may be coded
              explicitly request the default.

     TOSEQ    specifies  the last  card in  the  range to  be copied.
              omitted,  the  COPY ends  at the last  card.  If  FROMSEQ
              specified and  TOSEQ is  omitted,  only  one card  is copi
              TOSEQ=END may be coded to explicitly request the default.

     DDNAME   specifies the ddname  of the copy library to  be copied fr
              The default is SYSLIB unless  the LIBDD PARM option specif
              another name.  The PDS may be  in WYLBUR edit format but m
              have sequence numbers in col 73/80 (see Section 7.1).

     "./" control statements which are copied  are  treated  as  data.
     CHANGE command may be used to copy from  SYSUT1 to SYSUT2 and an AD
     COPY combination may be used to copy from any SYS ddname to SYSUT2.

     Example :

                 ./ C HASPINIT
                 ./ R  100K
                 ./ COPY HASPGEN

     Additional Detail Statements                                     MA


     The COPY statement  will be logically replaced in SYSIN  by the SYS
     member named HASPGEN. SYSIN will then look like:

                 ./ C HASPINIT
                 ./ R 100K
                 (all records of HASPGEN here)

     4.4   MACRO
           _____

     The MACRO command is similar to COPY  except that under CHANGE it n
     not follow an INSERT and the sequence  field is not blanked out.
     copied data  will be written  to SYSUT2  at whatever point  the upd
     happens to be, and with whatever sequence information happens to be
     the copied  member.  Data copied in  this manner logically  appears
     have originated in SYSUT1 rather than in SYSIN.

     The MACRO command is restricted in that no range may be specified (
     range is always 0-END).  In addition, the DDNAME of the library can
     be overridden.

     +------------------------------------------------------------------
     ×
     ×   ./ MACRO ¯NAME=nameò[,VERSION=version]
     ×
     ×   ./ MACRO ¯nameò[,version]
     ×
     +------------------------------------------------------------------

     NAME     is the name of the member to be copied.

     VERSION  is as described in Section 6.1

     MACRO commands are ignored if not in the primary control file (SYSI
     Data inserted using MACRO is not listed unless the LIST=ALL option
     selected on  the CHANGE/ADD command.  It  is also not included  in
     DECK option's output.

     Example :

                 ./ C HASPINIT
                 ./ MACRO  HASPGEN

     produces  the same  effect  as  the example  in  the  COPY command
     HASPINIT contains no statement with a line number less than 100K.

     4.5   LOCATE (L)
           ______  _

     LOCATE is  used to position the  new master to the  specified seque
     number.  It may be used prior to  a COPY or MACRO statement to cont
     the placement of the copied data.

     +------------------------------------------------------------------
     ×

     ×
     ×   ./ LOCATE seq1[,incr,new1]
     ×
     +------------------------------------------------------------------

     SEQ1     is the sequence number to which the new master is position
              and after which insertions will be placed.

     INCR     specifies the numbering increment.  INCR defaults to 1 unl
              a different value of INCR is coded in the PARM statement.

     NEW1     specifies  the sequence  number  to be  placed  on the  fi
              inserted card. NEW1 defaults to SEQ1+INCR.

     The NEW1 and INCR parameters are  ignored when LOCATE precedes a MA
     request.  They are  used if LOCATE is followed by  COPY or unsequen
     data cards to be inserted.

     LOCATE  functions exactly  as  does INSERT,   except  that no  warn
     message is issued when no insertion is made.

                       ADDITIONAL PDS FUNCTION STATEMENTS


     The following commands are useful for  PDS maintenance and may be u
     only for PDSs.  They are function statements and do not require an
     or CHANGE card.

     5.1   LIST
           ____

     It is often desirable  to LIST the source data in  a PDS member.  T
     could be done  using the CHANGE command to update  the desired memb
     with SYSUT2 directed to a printer and a null change-update deck, or
     having  SYSUT2  be  the  DUMMY data  set,   and  specifying  LIST=A
     Unfortunately,  this limits the listing capacity to SYSUT1,  unless
     ADD - COPY combination is used,   and requires running a separate s
     to perform updates.  Alternatively,  it  requires using INDD and OU
     PARM options, with additional DD cards.

     The LIST command provides for listing the  contents of a PDS member
     a more natural and efficient manner, and is written as follows:

     +------------------------------------------------------------------
     ×
     ×   ./ LIST ¯NAME=nameò[,VERSION=version,FROMSEQ=fromseq,
     ×              TOSEQ=toseq,DDNAME=ddname]
     ×   ./ LIST ¯nameò[,version,fromseq,toseq,DDNAME=ddname]
     ×
     +------------------------------------------------------------------

     NAME     is the name of the PDS member to be listed.

     VERSION  is as described in Section 6.1

     FROMSEQ  may  be used  to specify  a  starting sequence  number to
              listed.  If TOSEQ is omitted, at most one card is listed.

     TOSEQ    specifies the sequence number of the last card to be liste

     DDNAME   specifies  another library  to be  listed  from.  If  list
              members from more than one library,   it is most efficient
              group all the  LIST cards for a  particular library togeth
              The  default name  is  SYSLIB unless  the  LIBDD PARM  opt
              specifies another name.

     5.2   LOAD
           ____

     The LOAD command creates a library  of update (CHANGE and ADD)  dec
     Each CHANGE or ADD deck following a ./ or LOAD card in SYSIN become
     member of  the PDS.  Each  member is stored  in SYSUT2 under  the n
     given on its  CHANGE or ADD card.   The ENDUP statement should  not
     used with LOAD because it is executed when encountered, and the upd
     is terminated.

     +------------------------------------------------------------------
     ×
     ×   ./ LOAD
     ×
     +------------------------------------------------------------------

     The  update  decks being  stored  must  contain only  detail  updat
     commands,  since a major command would  be executed,  not loaded.
     decks should not contain any ENDUP cards. The update decks are furt
     restricted in that their CHANGE or ADD cards may not be continued.

     The LOAD function  is intended to support chained  libraries used w
     recursive or multiple version updates in  a later run.  The CHANGE
     ADD cards  will be treated  as specifying VERSION=NEXT,   or VERSIO
     (when the name does not already exists).  Thus LOAD should not be u
     to store  an update deck intended  for another purpose.   To  store
     update deck directly, you may use ADD or CHANGE and the CTL PARM.

     5.3   GENALIAS
           ________

     GENALIAS assigns an alias to an existing member in the new master.
     does not require an ADD or CHANGE operation for that member.

     +------------------------------------------------------------------
     ×
     ×   ./ GENALIAS ¯NAME=name,NEWNAME=newnameò
     ×
     ×   ./ GENALIAS ¯name,newnameò
     ×
     +------------------------------------------------------------------

     NAME     is the name of the existing member.

     NEWNAME  is the name of  the alias to be assigned to  it.  GENALIAS
              not valid when CHAIN is in effect, and should not be used
              members in a CHAIN library which have multiple versions.

     The RENAME  command may  be used  to change  the name  of an  exist
     SYSUT2 member. It is written:

     +------------------------------------------------------------------
     ×
     ×   ./ RENAME ¯NAME=name,NEWNAME=newnameò
     ×
     ×   ./ RENAME ¯name,newnameò
     ×
     +------------------------------------------------------------------

     NAME     is the name of the new master PDS member to be changed.

     NEWNAME  specifies the name to  be given to the new member  in the
              master PDS.


     5.5   SCRATCH (DROP)
           _______  ____

     Occasionally,  it may  become necessary to completely  remove a mem
     from a library (PDS).  This operation may be done by using the SCRA
     command,  which will delete the named member from the SYSUT2 data s
     This command is written as follows:

     +------------------------------------------------------------------
     ×
     ×   ./ SCRATCH ¯NAME=nameò
     ×
     ×   ./ SCRATCH ¯nameò
     ×
     +------------------------------------------------------------------

     NAME     is the PDS member to be removed from the new master.

     5.6   RESTORE (RECOVER)
           _______  _______

     The RESTORE statement may  be used to restore a member  which has b
     scratched.  It will  work correctly only on the  original library f
     which  the  member  was  scratched  (or  an  FDRDSF  restored  vers
     thereof), which has not been compressed in the interim.

     +------------------------------------------------------------------
     ×
     ×   ./ RESTORE NAME=name hexadecimal text
     ×
     ×   ./ RESTORE name hex,text
     ×
     +------------------------------------------------------------------

     NAME     where NAME is the  new name to be assigned to  the member
              need not be the same as the  original,  but it must be uni
              in the new master).  At least  one blank must follow the N
              field.

     hex text is the  text from  a prior IEBUPDTX  listing,  and  is cop
              without the labels from the OLD/NEW name ENTRY: line produ
              in  the listing.   RESTORE does  not  permit continuation
              comments.

     Example :

     On a prior IEBUPDTX run, an ADD operation might produce
         <01> MEMBER XYZ HAS BEEN ADDED       132 RECORDS
         NEW XYZ      ENTRY: TTR=001203 INDC=04 SSI=00081355 DATA=813552

     A subsequent IEBUPDTX ./ SCRATCH request would produce
         <01> ./  SCRATCH NAME=XYZ
         OLD XYZ      ENTRY: TTR=001203 INDC=04 SSI=00081355 DATA=813552

     the corresponding RESTORE card would contain

              ./ RESTORE XYZ 001203,04,00081355,8135522F

     The commas are intended for legibility and are not significant.

     Caution is  advised when  RESTORE is used  for chained  members.  M
     CHAIN updates modify  two entries in the directory  (the version al
     and  the  production  alias).   When  the  highest  version  alias
     scratched,   the production  alias is  rewritten with  the new  'hi
     version number.   A RESTORE for the scratched version would not upd
     the  production  entry,   resulting  in  incorrect  operation  of
     VERSION=NEXT operand on a subsequent ADD/CHANGE.

     RESTORE  only  performs  minimal  validity  checking.   If  you  en
     incorrect information,  the new member may  be unusable or the libr
     may become not copyable with IEBCOPY/IEHMOVE.

     6.1   VERSION (CHAINED) LIBRARIES
           _______  _______  _________

     Chained libraries allow multiple versions of  a member to be stored
     a PDS. They are convenient for the following:

        * When updating an old master,  the  new master can be placed in
          the same  PDS as  a new  version of  the same  member via  the
          CHAIN=id option.  After testing this new version,  the CURRENT
          command  can then  be used  to  specify it  as the  production
          version.  The  older version  need not be  deleted and  can be
          respecified  as  the  production version  (using  CURRENT  and
          VERSION=) if the new version should fail to perform correctly.

        * Chained libraries can also be created to contain update decks.
          By using the  CHAINUPD PARM option,  chained  members starting
          from  version  0   to  the  production  version   are  applied
          recursively to update the old master.

     See Section 6.2 for example using a chained library as update.

     The CHANGE and ADD commands described  in Section 2 will automatica
     destroy an identically named member in  SYSUT2.  The use of VERSION
     CHANGE  or  ADD  commands avoids  this  possibility  by  automatica
     assigning a  unique new  name to  the new  master as  it is  stored
     SYSUT2.  With CHAINing, the first version of the member is stored w
     the actual name found  on the CHANGE or ADD card  as VERSION 0 (zer
     It looks  just like  a member  stored in any  OS PDS  - and  hence
     members  which  exist  in  a library  before  converting  to  CHAIN
     automatically behave like version 0 members. When storing a new mem
     into SYSUT2 with CHAINing specified,   however,  it must be explici
     declared as VERSION=0.

     So far,   nothing special has  happened.  CHAINing is  not implemen
     until  a second  version  of the  member is  stored  in SYSUT2.   W
     CHAINing is implemented for a member,   a member ID number is obtai
     from a special directory entry in SYSUT2 called the allocator (writ
     as @LLOCATR)  and assigned to the member.  All versions of this mem
     will have this member ID number in common. The PDS directory entry
     version zero of the member is expanded to include, among other thin
     this ID number,  and is re-written  along with another directory en
     for version zero's special "internal" name back to SYSUT2's directo

     Now there  are three  directory entries  for the  two versions  of
     member - one  has the version zero  internal name and points  to (i
     contains the TTR of) the original member,  the second has the inter
     name representing version one,  and points to the new member,  and
     third has the actual external member name of the member (which you
     on the CHANGE  card to refer to  it)  and still points  to the vers
     zero (original) member.

          The format of an internal name is

                 +--------------------------------------+
                              +            +
                 × two byte   × three byte × three byte ×
                 × library id × member id  × version no ×
                 +--------------------------------------+
                              +            +

     Internal names may be used directly (with due caution)  in most cas
     Doing  so  will  generally  cause   VERSION=NEXT  operations  to  w
     incorrectly and possibly cause an old  version to be scratched.   T
     alternative is provided to facilitate recovery when a production al
     is inadvertently scratched.

     Since  this  third  directory entry  (called  the  "production  ali
     because it contains  the real "production" name of  the member)  st
     points to  version zero,   any reference  made by  any OS  function
     program to the CHAINed member name will continue to provide the sou
     data  in version  zero.  Similarly,   references made  by IEBUPDTX
     described in  Section 2 will also  produce only version  zero.   He
     your version  is still invisible  to the  other users of  your CHAI
     library  and  will  remain  so  until  a  new  production  version
     designated with the CURRENT command.

     In order to test or use another version,  COPY (or MACRO)  the vers
     desired,  placing it  within the new master  (temporary)  output,
     passing this to a compiler or whatever.

     If someone runs an update of  the member specifying version one aga
     version one will be replaced. To avoid this, the next member should
     put in as version two (or as VERSION=NEXT).  Example:

     The following  will load different  versions of  a same member  int
     chained library:

      // EXEC PGM=IEBUPDTX,PARM='CHAIN=SH'
              .
              .
      ./ ADD MASTER,VERSION=0
              .
            data
              .
      ./ ADD MASTER,VERSION=1
              .
             data
              .

      ./ ADD MASTER,VERSION=2
              .
             data
              .

     6.1.1   CURRENT
             _______

     As soon  as a new  version is debugged,   the production alias  may
     rewritten to point to it instead of  version zero by using the CURR
     function statement.

     +------------------------------------------------------------------
     ×
     ×   ./ CURRENT ¯NAME=name,VERSION=versionò
     ×
     ×   ./ CURRENT ¯name,versionò
     ×
     +------------------------------------------------------------------

     NAME     is the name of the member to be affected.

     VERSION  is the version number to become the production version.

     CURRENT will set  the production alias to point to  the version num
     specified.  This does  not cause the previous "current"  version to
     lost,  since it is still locatable  by its internal name.  Hence,
     previous (working)  version can always be retrieved in an emergency
     using another CURRENT command.

     Example:

     The following inserts version 8 as the production version in a chai
     library of update decks (assuming that versions 0 - 7 already exist

      //  EXEC PGM=IEBUPDTX,PARM='CHAIN=UP'
              .
              .
      //SYSIN DD *
      ./ LOAD
      ./ CHANGE A
      ./ INSERT 100,10
              XX
              YY
      ./ CURRENT A,VERSION=8

     If the library  is now used as  an intermediate update with  a PARM
     'CHAIN,CHAINUPD' (see  Section 6.2),  all version  members from 0
     will be used as recursive updates.

     6.1.2   Specifying Version Numbers
             __________ _______ _______

     Version numbers  may be specified on  most function statements  and
     two detail statements  (COPY and MACRO).   Table 6  lists the comma
     for which  VERSION= is  valid.  Version numbers  are specified  as
     second positional operand,   or by using the VERSION=  or V= keywor
     VERSION=NEXT  may be  specified on  a CHANGE  or ADD  card to  prev
     accidental deletion of a  version when the user is not  certain of
     next version number. The output listing will tell which version num
     should  be  used to  subsequently  reference  the version  created
     attempted by that run.

     Version number may be designated in three ways:

          HASPINIT-2
          HASPINIT,2
          HASPINIT,VERSION=2

     are all identical in meaning. All refer to version 2 of HASPINIT.

     VERSION specified  on a  CHANGE card  applies only  to the  new mas
     member name.   The production version  will be updated.   ADD-COPY
     recursive updates may be used to update an arbitrary version.

     To use  version numbers  on CHANGE/ADD commands,   it is  necessary
     inform IEBUPDTX  that SYSUT2  is to be  considered a  CHAINed libra
     This is done via an EXEC PARM, "CHAIN=ID".  ID will be used as the
     byte  library id  for  the library  defined by  SYSUT2  if it  does
     already have one.  It is a good idea  to give each library a unique
     so that there  will be no ambiguity possible if  they are concatena
     later. If the library already has an id (has been run once before w
     CHAIN=ID specified) you may omit the id, coding simply "CHAIN".

     Example 1

          ./ CHANGE HASPINIT-3

     means update the  current version of HASPINIT and store  the result
     version 3.

     Example 2

     To update version 2:

          //SYSIN DD *
          ./ CHANGE HASPINIT-3
          //OPDT1 DD *
          ./ ADD  HASPINIT
          ./ COPY HASPINIT-2,DDNAME=SYSUT1

     Version numbers may be used on commands as shown in Table 6.

     To SCRATCH any particular version of  a member,  after which it can
     be retrieved, simply use that version number on the SCRATCH command

                ./ SCRATCH name,version

     It is recommended that versions of a member be scratched in decreas
     order of  version numbers.  IEBUPDTX keeps  track of the  next vers
     number to  be assigned,   but the  process only  works if  the high
     version is scratched  first.  For example,  if versions 3,   4,  an
     exist,   VERSION NEXT  is 6;   if  version 5  is scratched,   IEBUP
     subtracts 1 from NEXT and NEXT will equal 5. If, however, version 4
     scratched, NEXT is not affected (and remains 6)  because 4 was not
     highest version created.

     6.2   RECURSIVE UPDATES
           _________ _______

     The use  of two  or more  update decks at  the same  time to  updat
     single member is called a recursive  update.  Given an original sou
     module and the update deck necessary to go  from level 0 to level 1
     this module, suppose that you want to update again to level 2.  If
     level 1 source  module is available,  it  may be used,  but  for la
     modules,  it may  not be practical to retain complete  source at ev
     level. Given such a situation, one can either:

        * create level 1 (temporary) from level 0 and update to level 2

        * update the level 1 update deck  and update directly from level
          0 to level 2 (a very risky procedure)

        * use two update decks recursively

     A recursive update  is a "nested" update  and is defined for  each
     master card image as:

                 level 2 = update2(update1(level 0)).

     To perform such an update, input:

        * level 2 update deck (which updates level 1 to level 2) via the
          control file

        * level 1 update deck via an intermediate update file

     An intermediate control  file is identified to IEBUPDTX  by any DDN
     which does not  begin with the letters SYS,  unless  the PARM inclu
     UPDATES=pfx,  in which case only DDNAMEs beginning with the designa
     prefix  are  used   as  intermediate  updates.    If   more  than
     intermediate update file is used, they are applied in the order of
     DD JCL  statements which  identify and define  them.  SYSIN  is alw
     applied last,  irrespective of the placement of the SYSIN DD statem
     in the JCL. It may be convenient to consider SYSUT1 as update level
     which of course always comes first.

     When using  intermediate update files,  the  member name found  on
     CHANGE  card  in SYSIN  is  used  to  locate  the update  decks  wh
     correspond  to  the  same  member   in  the  intermediate  files.

     intermediate update file  may be sequential or partitioned.   If it
     sequential, the order of updates must follow the order of CHANGE ca
     in  SYSIN;  if  it  is partitioned,   the  update  program can  loc
     intermediate   update   decks    automatically.    Using   partitio
     intermediate update  files is highly  recommended for doing  more t
     one update in a single job step.

     The SEQID option,  described under CHANGE  and ADD,  will not funct
     well with some sequential intermediate  situations.  When using SEQ
     INCR,  or NEW1  on an intermediate CHANGE card,   provide dummy CHA
     cards as  place holders for members  not being updated at  this lev
     The name  on the  place-holder's CHANGE  card must  match the  omit
     intermediate update. It is permissible to omit an update for any SY
     named  update  from  an  intermediate  update  library.   It  is  a
     permissible  for  an  intermediate  update deck  to  specify  the
     function,  in which case the source data from that member will be u
     as the old master.

     The recursive  updating technique is  sometimes convenient even  fo
     single update per member,  since all  the update decks could be pla
     in a  single PDS (using  the LOAD  function)  and the  updates desi
     could be selected with simple CHANGE cards in SYSIN. It is also use
     for updating something  from a library other than the  old master f
     defined by SYSUT1--(for instance,  if  SYSUT1 has an identically na
     member which was  not to be updated)--since an ADD  - COPY combinat
     may be used in an intermediate file to provide old master source.

     Also note that only updating commands are valid in intermediate upd
     decks.  The LIST, RENAME , SCRATCH, CURRENT, PARM,  LOAD,  ALIAS,
     MACRO commands are not functional unless in the main control file.
     SYSIN is omitted (not recommended),  IEBUPDTX will use an intermedi
     file as the main control file provided that the last such file defi
     is sequentially organized.

     If the  CHAINUPD PARM option is  specified,  IEBUPDTX will  check e
     intermediate member update fetched from a PDS to see if it is actua
     the production alias of a chain of updates. If this is so, each upd
     in  the  chain  from  version 0  through  the  production  alias  w
     automatically  be applied.   If  NOCHAINUPD  had been  specified  (
     default), only the production alias update would have been applied.

     SEQID is  a global  option,  and  is not  handled separately  for e
     recursive update deck.  Any SEQID specified by a lower level update
     completely overlaid  by specifying  SEQID in  a higher  level updat
     CHANGE card.

     If you  are using a sequential  intermediate update deck  whose CHA
     card specifies any of SEQID,  INCR,  or NEW1,  and if the intermedi
     update will not  be used immediately because  the previously perfor
     update didn't  update the member named  on its CHANGE card,   you m
     provide a  dummy CHANGE  command to  precede the  delayed intermedi
     update as a place-holder.  (The name on the place-holder's CHANGE c
     to match the omitted intermediate update).

     7.1   WYLBUR CONSIDERATIONS
           ______ ______________

     Any or  all data sets  used in IEBUPDTX may  be in WYLBUR  edit for
     (i.e. RECFM=U,  LRECL=BLKSIZE=3156 or 3520).  IEBUPDTX unpresses in
     data set into 80 byte card images and vice versa for output data se

     Additionally,  a new PARM option,  INTEGER,   can be negated if WYL
     line numbers and sequence numbers  are synonymous.  PARM=NOINT appl
     only to SYSUT1 (old master)  and  SYSUT2 (new master)  data sets si
     update decks usually do not contain sequence numbers.

     There are several  restrictions if SYSUT2 is in WYLBUR  format and
     INTEGER option is turned off:

        * SEQID= on ADD or CHANGE cards may not be used.

        * SYSUT1, the old master, may not have an old SEQID.

        * When doing an initial ADD (i.e.  no SYSUT1),  sequence numbers
          are required, and may be supplied in columns 73/80 explicitly,
          or  by leaving  columns 73/80  blank and  using the  NEW1/INCR
          options on ADD.

     Advantages to not using the INTEGER option are:

        * minimizing the  amount of  space used  - 8  or more  bytes are
          saved for every line in the data set;

        * no  need  to  put  sequence  numbers  in  columns  73/80  when
          inserting new lines in the data set.

     Note that  since WYLBUR  numbers start  at .001  and sequence  numb
     start at 1, the latter will always be 1000 times the former.  Hence
     the WYLBUR data set begins numbering at 1,  the corresponding seque
     number starts at 00001000.

     7.2   WRITING USER UPDATING EXITS (USER COMMAND)
           _______ ____ ________ _____  ____ _______

     With IEBUPDTX it is possible to define your own update commands. To
     this,  it is necessary to write a USER update exit routine in assem
     language as described below.  This program  is loaded from the defa
     STEPLIB or  JOBLIB and  branched to  as specified  by the  USER det
     command.

           This command is written as follows:

     +------------------------------------------------------------------
     ×
     ×   ./ USER ¯NAME=name,SEQ1=seq1ò[,SEQ2=seq2,CODE=code]
     ×
     ×   ./ USER ¯name,seq1ò[,seq2,code]
     ×
     +------------------------------------------------------------------

     NAME     specifies the entry point name of  the load module to be u
              as the USER exit routine.

     SEQ1     specifies the sequence number of  the first old master rec
              to be USER updated.

     SEQ2     specifies the sequence  number of the last  old master rec
              to be USER updated. Seq2 may be omitted if only one record
              to be updated.

     CODE     is any  string of from  one to eight  alphanumeric charact
              which  will  be made  available  to  the USER  exit  routi
              right-justified in a  doubleword.  The code default  is ei
              blanks.

     For each  old master  card found  in the  range defined  by seq1-se
     IEBUPDTX will branch to the entry point name of the exit routine.
     USER exit routine may delete, modify, insert, or leave unchanged at
     before the current old master card.   This choice must be communica
     to IEBUPDTX by  setting the appropriate return codes  in register R
     as follows:

           0    Do not modify the current old master card.

           4    Delete the current old master card.

           8    Replace the old master card with the specified data  (se
                below).

           12   Insert specified new data before the current  old  maste
                record.   Branch  to this routine again with the same ol
                master record.

           16   Stop this member update (severity 8)

     The following registers are set at entry to the exit routine:

                          if omitted on USER command.

                          beginning  of  each  member  update)  but   no
                          changed  by IEBUPDTX after that.  The work are
                          must be  used  to  retain  information  betwee
                          successive  invocations of the exit routine, a
                          following an insert.  This is because the  sam
                          routine  may  be  in  use  by  an  intermediat
                          update.

                          In general, the contents of seq1 and  seq2  ar
                          unimportant.  Seq2 may be set equal to the seq
                          value  to  inhibit any possible future calls t
                          the exit routine for the current USER  command
                          except for the call which must follow an inser
                          request.   Do  not  set  seq1  and  seq2 in an
                          manner so as to prevent this.  (i.e., never se
                          seq2 less  than  the  sequence  number  of  th
                          current old master card.)

                 hex 10:  seq1 from the USER command (EBCDIC with leadin
                          zeroes).

                 hex 18:  seq2 from the USER command.

           2     The contents of R2 + 6 point to the current  old  maste
                 record.   (The  first  6  bytes  are  the identificatio
                 bytes, as seen in the listings -- e.g. <01>,  MAC  ,  o
                 blanks).   Do  not  modify  any  of  the old master dat
                 directly.

           3     Register R3 points to 6 below a 72 byte area in which t
                 place   replacement   or    insertion    data.     E.g.
                 MVC 6(72,R3),NEWREC   ).

           4     Register R4 points to  PWA  (the  Print  Work  Area)  o
                 IEBUPDTX,  and  may  be  useful  if  messages  are to b
                 printed from the exit routine.  Note that such  message
                 must be printed using the XPRNTLIN macro only.  XPRNTLI
                 is a macro found in IEBUPDTX source.

     The USER  exit routine  must be  serially re-usable,   with no  mem
     (other than the work area provided by IEBUPDTX) between invocations

     The following discussion may be helpful in using the USER feature m
     efficiently:

     Whenever a branch  to a user exit is required,   IEBUPDTX compares
     entry point name (saved from the USER command)  against a global fi
     which contains the name of the entry  point last LOADed.  If the na
     match,  IEBUPDTX branches directly to the exit routine.  If they do
     match,  IEBUPDTX must first issue the DELETE macro instruction for
     previous routine, if any,  and then the LOAD macro instruction for
     new entry point name.  After the new exit routine is loaded,  its n
     and address are saved globally.

     Hence it  is most  efficient to have  a single  USER exit  routine
     update whenever possible (one routine may perform several functions
     testing the code specified on the  USER command),  and least effici
     to have several separate load modules invoked in a mixed sequence.

     If SCAN  or FIX is  active on the  same card  image as USER,   USER
     applied last (to  allow the exit routine to detect,   perhaps,  if
     identification field of the old master record is blank). Only one U
     command  can  apply  to  an  old   master  record,   unless  one  u
     intermediate update files.

     A 'global' user exit may be specified via the PARM field. Such an e
     routine applies to each card about to  be written into the new mast
     and may only ignore, modify,  or delete.  In this case,  modificati
     may be  applied (by the exit  routine)  directly to the  input reco
     without moving it.  For compatibility,  the global exit is called w
     R2 = R3. Furthermore, only one global exit may be active at a time
     no CODE may be passed.  An example of a user exit routine which may
     employed either locally  or globally is HERB.  HERB,   which insert
     minus sign  into assembly language  macro model statements  just af
     the operand field  (to improve readability of  assembly listings),
     supplied with the IEBUPDTX distribution tape.

     7.3   DYNAMIC INVOCATION OF IEBUPDTX
           _______ __________ __ ________

     IEBUPDTX may be invoked from Assembler programs (and others capable
     providing  the  correct parameter  lists)   in  a fashion  similar
     IEBUPDTE invocation. The interface is similar, but not identical.

        * IEBUPDTX does not support the  option of specifying a starting
          page number for SYSPRINT.  The documented OPTLIST and DDNMELST
          entries are supported, HDNGLIST is ignored when present.

        * While IEBUPDTX may be invoked  via LOAD/CALL,  LINK or ATTACH,
          the program is not re-entrant,  and  may not be re-usable when
          errors occur. The preferred form of invocation is ATTACH.

        * The supported DDNMELST entries are :

          1   reserved - zeroes (XL8'0')

          2   reserved - zeroes

          3   reserved - zeroes

          4   SYSLIB replacement or zeroes

          5   SYSIN replacement or zeroes

          6   SYSPRINT replacement or zeroes

          7   SYSPUNCH replacement or zeroes

          8   SYSUT1 replacement or zeroes

          9   SYSUT2 replacement or zeroes

     Note  that IEBUPDTX  performs  no validity  checking  on the  suppl
     entries.  The DD names for SYSIN,  SYSPRINT and SYSPUNCH should alw
     be unique;   the SYSLIB  name may  be the  same as  SYSUT1 or  SYSU
     SYSUT1 and  SYSUT2 should normally be  unique,  but could be  the s
     when only partitioned datasets are processed.

           ________ _________ _______

     The  standard utility  programs  commonly  used to  produce  direct
     listings are not helpful for libraries containing members created w
     the  CHAIN  option.   IEBUPDTX  provides   a  separate  program  wh
     reproduces the structure of chained members. The required JCL is:

      ... JOB card; other control cards as required
      //step EXEC PGM=IEBUPCHN,REGION=nnnK
      //SYSPRINT  DD  SYSOUT=A    listing file
      //SYSUT2    DD  DISP=SHR,DSN=dsname   library to be processed
      //SYSPUNCH  DD  SYSOUT=B,DCB=BLKSIZE=    [optional punch file]

     A region specification may be  required for extremely large librari
     Each member,  alias and version  entry requires approximately 36 by
     in storage; an additional 28K should be allowed for program overhea

     When the SYSPUNCH  DD is supplied,  a DCB=BLKSIZE=  must be specifi
     Output consists of one ./ CHANGE card for each member found.

     The listing groups versions of the same production alias together,
     indicates the current version by an arrow ->.

     When the  production alias entry is  not found,  a warning  message
     issued. Recovery can be effected in several ways:

        * Use FDRDSF or  another backup facility to recover  from an old
          version of the library.

        * Run a ./ CHANGE using the explicit high version name; e.g.
                         ./ CHANGE NAME=idmmmnnn
          where "id" is  the @LLOCATR (CHAIN)  id;  "mmm"  is the member
          number;  and "nnn"  is the highest version  number.  This name
          appears on the listing.  When this change is completed and has
          added the  production alias back in,   you may use  ./ SCRATCH
          name,VERSION=LAST to delete  the dummy version created  by the
          CHANGE.

        * Use ./  RESTORE with the text  of the last  (highest)  version
          entry and  the name  of the  production member,   then use  ./
          CURRENT to assign the member to the desired production version
          (unless it is already the last one).

           _______ _________

     The IEBCOPY  utility,  whether used to  copy or compress,   alters
     directory entries for  CHAINed members by changing  some alias entr
     to main member entries.  This alters directory listings produced af
     copying, but does not affect IEBUPDTX CHAIN processing.

     IEBPDS, the PID provided utility for listing PDS directories,  and
     IBM supplied utilities will not  produce useful directory listings
     libraries  created with  CHAINing.  See  the IEBUPCHN  program in
     preceding section.

     PUNK, the PID provided utility for listing, punching,  and reproduc
     card  format oriented  datasets,  may  not produce  useful output
     CHAINed libraries. IEBUPDTX flags most members as ALIAS entries, wh
     PUNK ignores by default.  To ensure  that all members are processed
     PUNK, it should be invoked with PARM=ALIAS, which causes alias entr
     to be  treated as  members.  When  only the  current members  of ch
     entries are  desired,  the  PARM field  should also  specify a  glo
     exclude of other chain versions,  using PARM='EXCLUDE=id',  where "
     is the CHAIN id of the library.  Note that either the CHAIN entries
     the @LLOCATR member may be excluded, but not both.  Due to the form
     which  PUNK produces  output,  the  output  files will  not produce
     library in CHAIN format when reloaded  (the PDS directory data are
     preserved).   Libraries  with  CHAIN entries  should  be  copied  w
     IEBCOPY, IEHMOVE, or FDR/FDRDSF only.

     When PUNK is used to produce a SYSUPDTE file (unload in IEBUPDTE SY
     format),   any cards  found  within a  member  beginning  with ./
     converted to @/.  This conversion is done to prevent conflicts with
     ADD control cards punched by PUNK for the members proper.   When th
     members are restored,  the @/ should  be changed back,  or the memb
     could be processed with IEBUPDTX using the CTL=@/ PARM.

     Several PID supplied utilities, notably WYLVTOC, examine the SSI fi
     of members. When this field is in the form 000nnnnn, it is interpre
     as a  date (form yyddd)   and displayed  on the listing.    This us
     matches that  of the WYLBUR SAVE  command,  the WYLCOMP  utility,
     others. SSI in different form should be used with due consideration
