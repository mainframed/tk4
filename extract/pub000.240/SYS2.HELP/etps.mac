                EMERGENCY TELE-PROCESSING SERVICES


********************************************************************

 Function -

  This program is intended to provide emergency tele-processing
  services when the normal subsystems such as JES, VTAM, TCAM, etc.
  are not available. It is intended to be invoked as a started task,
  and it must be defined as a secondary subsystem in order
  to be able to start when JES is not available.


 Logging on and off -

  The first thing the program does is prompt for a user-id and
  password. The user-id is compared to a list of valid user-id's,
  see the "USERTABL" in the code. As provided the following user-id's
  are allowed to log on: IBMUSER, HERC01, HERC02.

  The password is not currently validated in any way, but is used
  as the default password for dataset allocations.

  The logon menu looks like:


     ENTER USER ID: _           (IBMUSER, HERC01 and HERC02 are valid)
      AND PASSWORD:             (default dataset password)
        RACF GROUP:             (not used anywhere in version 2.4-3.8j)


  If the "logon" is successful, the primary option menu (as in SPF) is
  displayed, and the user can begin processing.

  To shut down, enter "EOJ" in the user-id field, or hit any PFK.

  Note that as opposed to productivity tools like RFE, RPF, ISPF/PDF
       or SPF the focus of ETPS is _NOT_ to provide a waterproof
       environment being immune against even most unexpected user input.

       It is instead an emergency environment intended to be used by
       experienced persons being able to enter exactly what's expected
       in the menus. If unexpected input is received the most probable
       result is an abend. Don't expect chatty error messages and just
       start over if you experience an abend. If the abend persists
       try another path to accomplish what you need to do. If that
       doesn't help... well, then take a look at the code and fix it ;-)

       So, it's for sure a good idea to get acquainted with ETPS
       while you're system is running normally. Try a least the editor
       and the PDS utility to find out how you can match their
       functionality with your preferred working methods.


 PF key assignments -

    PFK definitions cannot be changed:

             PF1  - help
             PF2  - split the screen
             PF3  - return (in edit, save and end)
             PF4  - cancel (in edit, end nosave)
             PF5  - find or repeat find in edit or browse
             PF6  - change or repeat change in edit
             PF7  - scroll up
             PF8  - scroll down
             PF9  - switch screens (for split-screen mode)
             PF10 - scroll left  (browse only)
             PF11 - scroll right (browse only)
             PF12 - cursor home (CAPS/ASIS toggle in edit)


    A special note on PF9: When in split-screen mode, you must use
    PF9 to switch from one screen to another. Just moving the
    cursor doesn't get it.


 The primary option menu looks like:

-------------------       ETPS  -  PRIMARY OPTION MENU     -------------
SELECT OPTION ===>
                                                             USERID   -
   1   BROWSE DATA                                           TIME     -
   2   EDIT SOURCE DATA                                      TERMINAL -
   3   PDS UTILITY
   4   IDCAMS (VSAM) INTERFACE


   X   EXIT       - TERMINATE ETPS AND RETURN TO LOGON MENU

PRESS  END KEY  TO TERMINATE ETPS                             Version 2.


 If option 2 (edit) is selected, an edit menu is displayed:


------------------------ EDIT - ENTRY PANEL  ---------------------------
ENTER/VERIFY PARAMETERS BELOW:
FULLY-QUALIFIED DSNAME ==>
         VOLUME SERIAL ==>                   (IF NOT CATALOGED)

      DATASET PASSWORD ==>                   (IF PASSWORD PROTECTED)



  Note that dataset names must be entered as fully-qualified
       names, not in quotes.

  Also, there is a bug in the code such that you cannot enter
  the member name in parens. This will be fixed when i get around
  to it.

  Only PS and PO files with lrecl=80 can be edited.

  If the dataset is a PDS, you will be presented with a member
  list. You can scroll up and down using PFK7 and 8. A member
  can be selected for edit by entering an "S" in the column to
  the left of the member name. There is a  "locate" function to
  position yourself in the library, similar to SPF; just type
  "l mem" on the command input line (note: The line positioning in
  the member list doesn't exactly work when using the "l" command).

  The editor enforces sequence numbers in columns 73-80 of the data.
  Any dataset edited will be (re)numbered using a 10s increment. So,
  don't edit a dataset if columns 73-80 contain data. If you rely on
  specific line numbers, copy the dataset before editing it, so that
  you can restore your line numbers later, when your full function
  editor is available again.

  Initially the editor is in CAPS mode, which means that all lines
  modified get translated to uppercase. Press PF12 to toggle CAPS
  and ASIS modes.

  On the top right corner of the editor screen there is a "SCROLL ===>"
  input field with an initial setting of HALF. This field controls the
  function of the scroll keys (PF7 backward, PF8 forward) as follows:

  - PAGE:   Scroll keys move full page
  - HALF:   Scroll keys move half page
  - CSR:    Scroll keys move to cursor position
  - MAX:    Scroll keys move to TOP/BOTTOM once
  - number: Scroll keys move number of lines

  A setting entered in this field remains in effect during an edit
  session until it is changed. An exception is the MAX setting which
  is valid only for one interaction. All settings can be abbrevated to
  the first character.

  A numeric scroll amount as well as "m" can also be specified directly
  in the command input field together with pressing PF7/8 to scroll
  that amount once. This method doesn't change the setting of the
  SCROLL field.

  Note that there also are SCROLL fields on the ETPS list and browse
       screens. But except for the editor's SCROLL field these are
       not yet functional.

  The editor is a very primitive tool. You can repeat lines,
  delete lines, and type over lines. You can copy a line
  after another line. You can find a string of characters and
  change it to another string of characters of the same length.

  To delete a line, enter a "d" in the sequence number column at
  the left. There is no "dd" (delete range) command.

  To repeat a line, enter an "r" in the sequence number column at
  the left.  You can only repeat one line at a time.

  To copy a line, enter a "c" in the sequence number column at
  the left, and an "a" on the line you want to copy it after.

  You can type over any or all lines on the screen, but i have not
  tested mixing this with "d" and "r" line commands, so watch it.

  To search for a character string, enter "f " on the command line
  and enter the character string on the "find string" line. If
  the string has leading or trailing blanks or single quotes, you
  have to put the whole shot in single quotes. (PF5 is find/rfind)

  The "find string" line also has a "change to" area. this is used
  to change the find string to some other string of characters. At
  present, both strings must be the same length. To change a string
  of characters, both the "find" and "change" areas must be filled
  in; then enter "c" on the command line or press PF key 6. you can
  change only one occurence of the "find string" at a time, there is
  no "change all" command as yet. 24 characters is the maximum that
  can be specified.

  note that "save" is the default, whether or not you have changed
       any cards in the member, so enter "cancel" on the command
       line if you don't want this to happen (See PF keys below).

  To submit a JCL stream you are editing, just type "sub" on
  the command line; the JES job number will appear in the message
  area in the upper-right corner of the screen. Note that if you
  are running as a sub-system, you cannot submit jobs. For that
  reason, you should always have 2 proc's in SYS1.PROCLIB--one
  defined as a sub-system, and one not so defined. You should start
  the sub-system if JES is not up, and start the other if you will
  need to submit batch jobs.

  ETPS does not invoke the TSO SUBMIT exit, so if you have any
  special handling there, just be aware that it won't happen.


 Option 1 from the primary option menu selects the browse function.

  The menu is essentially the same than the edit menu with the
  exception that a minimal version of Bill Godfrey's REVIEW program
  is called to view the data instead of the editor. As this is
  a predecessor of todays well known REVIEW implemation from Greg Price
  there shouldn't be any explanations needed. The look and feel is
  quite similar to Greg's REVIEW but the following should be notes:

  - The SCROLL field in the upper right corner of the screen isn't
    functional. Use PF7/8 for for the standard one page scroll amount
    or enter a numeric value on the command line and press PF7/8 to
    scroll that number of lines. "m" is accepted for "scroll max" and
    the "top" and "bottom" commands are also available.

  - The data is displayed in upper case per default. Use the "asis"
    command to switch to mixed case and the "caps" command to switch
    back to upper case.

  - The "find" command isn't implemented.


 Option 3 displays the following PDS utility menu:

------------------------UTILITY- ENTRY PANEL ---------------------------
SELECT OPTION ===>

    BLANK  - DISPLAY MEMBER LIST        C  - COMPRESS DATASET



ENTER/VERIFY PARAMETERS BELOW:
FULLY-QUALIFIED DSNAME ==>
         VOLUME SERIAL ==>                   (IF NOT CATALOGED)

      DATASET PASSWORD ==>                   (IF PASSWORD PROTECTED)


  Leaving the option field empty and specifying a PDS in the lower part
  of the menu displays the same member list as the edit and the browse
  menus do but this list supports a few additional functions besides
  just selecting a member. These are:

  s or e ---  edit member
       b ---  browse member
       d ---  delete member
       r ---  rename member  (requires "newname" field to be filled in)
       c ---  copy   member  (requires "newname" field to be filled in)

  In addition the PDS utility menu supports compressing a PDS. Just
  enter "c" in the option field and specify a PDS in the lower part
  of the menu to compress it. Note that this function isn't available
  when running as a sub-system.


 Option 4 displays the IDCAMS command menu:

   ENTER IDCAMS COMMAND BELOW ------------------------------------------
COMMAND INPUT ===>  *
COMMAND INPUT ===>  *
COMMAND INPUT ===>  *
COMMAND INPUT ===>  *
COMMAND INPUT ===>  *


  To execute an IDCAMS command enter it in any of the command fields.
  It's output will be displayed in a browse window.

                   ×That's it. This is not SPF.×
                   +===========================+


 Operational note -

    ETPS is implemented as a started task. There exist two procedures
    in SYS1.PROCLIB: Entering "S ETPS" at the console starts ETPS as
    a sub-system, i.e. without needing a primary job entry sub-system
    (JES) to be active. Entering "S ETSO" starts it as a "normal"
    task under the primary sub-system and thus requires JES to be
    active. The only functional differences are that when running as a
    sub-system it isn't possible to submit jobs using the SUBMIT
    command of the editor and it isn't possible to use the compress
    function of the PDS utility.

    Both procedures take the following parameters:

    O=mode    O=ET means: Display an alien and request the user to logon
              O=OP means: Directly logon IBMUSER and present the
                          primary option menu.

    T=model   model designates the 3270 model:
              2 = 327x model 2
              A = 3278 model 2A (per Wayne Mitchell)
              3 = 327x model 3
              4 = 327x model 4

    U=cuu     cuu is the device address of the terminal on which ETPS
              is to be started.


 Parm of the ETPS program -

  The ETPS and ETSO procedures call the ETPS program with a standard
  8 byte execute-card format parm using the above parameters,
  as is required by the program:

    1. The first 2 characters are the mode value, characters 3 and
       4 are "PS". This yields "ETPS" for the first 4 characters,
       if O=ET was specified or defaulted and "OPPS" if O=OP was
       specified. These combinations are used by the program to
       decide, whether a "logon" is required or not.

    2. The 5th byte is terminal type as defined above.

    3. The last 3 bytes are the unit address of the terminal.


  The ETPS program can also be called from a TSO terminal session.
  This is done by specifying a parm of "TSO". The ETPSTSO command
  processor is provided invoke ETPS from TSO.
