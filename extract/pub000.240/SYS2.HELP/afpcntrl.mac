AFPCNTRL - Control Additional Floating Point (AFP) Registers
------------------------------------------------------------


AFP And BFP Overview
--------------------

The S/370 architecture originally provides four floating point
registers, numbered 0, 2, 4, and 6. Later architectures or features
provide additional floating point (AFP) registers, numbered 1, 3, 5, 7,
and 8 to 15.

If the AFP registers are available on a system, they can be enabled or
disabled by setting or clearing control register 0 bit 13. This bit also
enables or disables the binary floating point (BFP) instructions, if the
system has the BFP facility installed. Initially, this bit is cleared,
which means that neither the AFP registers nor the BFP instructions can
be used, regardless whether the system is equipped with the respective
features. The AFPCNTRL utility can be used to set or clear CR 0 bit 13.

MVS 3.8j as provided with TK4- does not contain support for the AFP
registers. That means it neither detects nor activates those registers.
Consequently, it has no logic to save and restore them to maintain
context switch integrity. Thus, switching CR0 bit 13 on using the
AFPCNTRL utility compromises the system integrity: If more than one job
is using the AFP registers at the same time, there is a high probability
that they will get their respective register contents mixed up, leading
to unpredictable results.

While the AFP registers are available on any Hercules system, the BFP
instructions generally are not available on systems operating in S/370
mode, as those instructions are not part of the S/370 instruction set.
The TK4- version of Hercules, however, makes some 300 instructions from
later architecturs available as an extension to S/370 mode. The BFP
instructions are part of this extension, which can be activated by
entering the "ldmod s37x" Hercules command.


Using AFPCNTRL
--------------

o To enable the AFP registers issue the command

  S AFPON

  at an MVS console. If the s37x dynamic module is loaded, this command
  will also make the BFP instructions available.

  Note: Make sure to never run more than one job using the AFP registers
  ----- at the same time. It is strongly recommended to switch the AFP
        registers on when they are to be used only, and to switch them
        back off immediately after use.

o To disable the AFP registers issue the command

  S AFPOFF

  at an MVS console. This command command will also make the BFP
  instructions unavailable.
