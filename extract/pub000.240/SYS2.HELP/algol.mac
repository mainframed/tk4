ALGOL F Level 2.1 - Independent Component Release by Tom Armstrong
------------------------------------------------------------------

The Algol F Level 2.1 Independent Component Release is a complete
replacement of the previous release Level 2.0 which was a component
of OS/360. The ICR includes a number of programming enhancements to
the Compiler and the Library. The Library routines have been updated
for compatibility with the MVS JES2/3 environment.

The high level qualifiers used for the ALGOL F installation are
ALGOL.F. The General Information Manual can be found in
TK4-.TOM.ALGOLF21.ZIP.

The following cataloged procedures are available for use with ALGOL F:

ALGOFC   -- compile an ALGOL F program
ALGOFCG  -- compile and execute an ALGOL F program
ALGOFCL  -- compile and link an ALGOL F program
ALGOFCLG -- compile, link and execute an ALGOL F program
