)F FUNCTION -
  Full Screen Interface (FSI) is a programming library modeled after
  SPF that supports full screen 3270 programming. To use FSI, one or
  more application panels are coded and stored in the Panel Library
  or PLIB data set. The application program uses a Display function
  call to display the panel. Input/output variables are used to allow
  the application to display dynamic content to the screen and allow
  the application program to retrieve input data from the terminal.

  FSI has been written by Tommy Sprinkle. The full documentation can
  be found on his website at http://www.tommysprinkle.com/mvs/fsi
  A ZIPed PDF copy of the documentation as of 2012/10/07 has been
  placed on the TK4- system in dataset TK4-.TOMMY.FSI120.DOC.ZIP

  The FSI datasets can be found at high level qualifier FSI.V1R2M0
