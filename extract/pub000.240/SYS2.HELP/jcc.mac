JCC: C Compiler created by Jason Winter
---------------------------------------

JCC is an ANSI compliant C Compiler that generates S/370 assembly
language.

JCC uses the JCC-Library which has optimisations for S/390 processors
which are automatically switched on when running on that equipment. For
Hercules users running MVS 3.8j who have compiled Hercules with 390
extensions-enabled, there is a global variable to allow manual switching
to the faster library code.

An extensive HTML help for JCC and the JCC-Library is available in the
distribution archive at TK4-.JASON.JCC.ZIP. To use this documentation
download the archive to your client system, unzip it and point your
browser to file help.htm in the unzipped folder.

To use JCC as preinstalled on TK4- you are required to read and comply
with Jason Winter's JCC User Agreement, which is provided at the end
of this HELP summary for your convenience.



Quick Start
-----------

Run SYS2.JCLLIB(TESTJCC) to make sure it works.



Datasets

JCC.CNTL     -- Sample job control from JCC distribution, augmented and
                adapted to be ready to run on TK4-. Note that generally
                the JCCC, JCCCG, JCCCL and JCCCLG family of cataloged
                procedures provide a more straightforward approach for
                using JCC.
JCC.INCLUDE  -- JCC-Library C header files
JCC.LINKLIB  -- JCC compiler and utility executables
JCC.OBJ      -- JCC-Library objects
JCC.RENT.OBJ -- reentrant JCC-Library objects
JCC.SRC      -- JCC utility source



Cataloged Procedures
--------------------

JCCC     -- compile a C program
JCCCG    -- compile and execute a C program
JCCCL    -- compile and link a C program
JCCCLG   -- compile, link and execute a C program

                         ==================
             JCC and the JCC-Library is not free software
             --------------------------------------------

JCC has been made available to allow mainframe users to compile other
peoples free software which was supplied in source code form. This is
designed to aid the development of free utilities for mainframes,
running on real hardware or within emulators like Hercules. End-users
who do not write C programs are not required to make any payments at all
for this use of JCC.

Programmers who develop free software using JCC are encouraged to pay an
annual US$50 fee to allow further development of the JCC compiler
software. This is not a strict rule however as that would go against the
first principle of aiding the development of free software for
mainframes. Likewise, programmers who just develop for themselves are
encouraged to make a contribution but this is not a strict rule.

To save effort for end-users, source code and the JCC compiled objects
may be distributed together without paying the annual fee, and without
changing the agreement terms already stated.

Programmers who develop software with JCC which is given away free, but
without source code, must pay the annual US$50 fee for the year in which
the object code is built. One-off developments in this case will not
require continued annual payment, however subsequent build releases
which extend past a 12 month period will require continued annual
payments.

Programmers who develop software with JCC which is sold, must pay the
annual fee of US$250 - all other conditions of the previous paragraph
apply. Businesses which use JCC must pay the annual fee of US$250
regardless of what intentions they have for the software they develop
with JCC.

As part of the conditions of use, you must agree not to sue me for any
issue related to JCC or the JCC-Library product, and to take full
responsibility for programs generated by JCC. JCC comes with no
warranty, implied or otherwise. Neither JCC, nor the JCC-Library may be
used to create or otherwise enhance another brand of C compiler. You
hereby agree to delete JCC and the JCC library files if you do not agree
to the other terms within this document.

Bug reports are always welcome, however only paying and current
subscribers will be informed of updates to the code-generator/library
when things are fixed or enhanced. This is due to my limited resources
and to encourage people described in paragraph 2 to make a contribution.
Having said all that, much effort has been spent testing the various
components of JCC and it should produce correctly operating programs
based on the ANSI C standard with only some small issues relating to the
MVS file-system.
