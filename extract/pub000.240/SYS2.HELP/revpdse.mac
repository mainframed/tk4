 -------------------- MEMBER LIST SELECTION CODES --------------------

 These selection codes can be used to select a member entry for
 processing from a directory member list display:

   S       - Selection code for selecting a member to be REVIEWed.
             'S' is the default selection code, and is assumed
             when the cursor is placed on an entry selection input
             field but no character is typed.

   B       - Selection code for selecting a member to be browsed.
             ISPF/PDF Browse is used.  This will only work if the
             file is acceptable to ISPF/PDF Browse and only in an
             ISPF environment.  This will not work if the 'REVIEW'
             command is issued from 'READY' mode.

   T       - Selection code for tagging an entry for later processing.
             Tagged entries are shown in high intensity or reverse
             video in the entry list.  If any members are tagged,
             then only tagged members are examined during a search.
             Further, tagging an entry may be useful for display
             control purposes when the entry list is large as RFIND
             can be used to locate the next tagged entry.  All tags
             can be cleared by REFRESH and RESET.

   R       - Selection code for resetting the tag status of an entry.
             All tags can be cleared by REFRESH and RESET.

   H       - Selection code for extracting and displaying the history
             of a program.

             The Binder API is invoked to access IDR data which is
             then formatted and shown with one item per line.  The
             last display record will usually contain the program
             bind (link edit) IDR data, including the date and time
             of the bind.

   M       - Selection code for extracting and displaying the module
             map of a program.

             The Binder API is invoked to access ESD (for compatible
             program objects) or MAP (for other levels) data which
             is then formatted and shown with one item per line.

             The types of map data shown are:
               'M'     Module
               'C'     Class
               'O'     Overlay segment
               'S'     Section within class
               'P'     Part within class
               'L'     Label within section
               'X'     Text extent within section or part
               'E'     End-of-module

             The use of FIND ALL can be used to enhance the display
             by suppressing unwanted data.

             Examples for PO level 1 program objects:
               To show only sections:
                 F SD 1 ALL
               To show only sections and their external labels:
                 F D 2 ALL

             Examples for other PO levels:
               To show only classes present:
                 F C 1 ALL
               To show all section names present:
                 F S 2 ALL

   /       - Selection code for selecting a member to be REVIEWed
             as if the DATA operand had been specified.  Normally,
             the DATA operand precludes access to PDS and PDSE member
             contents.  This selection code performs the same function
             as the 'S' selection code except that the DATA operand is
             deemed to have been specified.  This will prevent REVIEW
             from attempting to interpret data content such as
             pictures.

=START=SPLIT
)F   The START subcommand requests that a new parallel session is
  to be initiated and given control.  The new session will be under
  the RFE (REVIEW Front End) menu hierarchy.  The new session will
  NOT be started if it would cause the maximum logical session
  limit to be exceeded.  If no operand is supplied the RFE primary
  option menu is shown.
)X Syntax -

            that is to be swapped with the current session.
            'SWAP 0' is a no-operation.

             the exact member name must be specified.
               If no exact member name is found when the list is
             sorted by ID, then the operand is used to position
             the display to the matching user or job name.
=SELECT=SEL=S
)F   SELECT allows a member to be selected for REVIEW from the primary
  input area without first locating the member's list entry in the
  display.

     SELECT  'member'

 Aliases  - SEL, S
 Defaults - None.
 Required - 'member'
)O Operands -
)P 'member' -  The name of an existing member to be browsed by REVIEW.
=BROWSE=B

  input area without first locating the member's list entry in the
  display.  The invocation of ISPF Browse will not be successful
  unless REVIEW is running in an ISPF environment.
)X Syntax -
     BROWSE  'member'

 Alias    - B
 Defaults - None.
 Required - 'member'
)O Operands -
)P 'member' -  The name of an existing member to be browsed.

  CHA  or C - Sort the list into descending change timestamp order.
  DATE or D - Sort the list into descending change timestamp order.
  SIZE or S - Sort the list into descending size order.

  issued from a member selection list display.  That is, REVIEW saves
  any changes to the REVIEW profile and terminates.
)X Syntax -
     EXIT

 Aliases  - RETURN, =X
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
