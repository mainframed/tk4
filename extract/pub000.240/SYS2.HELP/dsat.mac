)F FUNCTION -
               THE DSAT COMMAND IS USED TO DISPLAY ALLOCATION
               INFORMATION FOR DATA SETS ON A DIRECT ACCESS
               DEVICE.

               DSAT WILL SEARCH THE OS CATALOG AND CVOLS FOR THE
               ENTRIES FOR THE DATA SETS SPECIFIED.  ALLOCATION
               INFORMATION WILL BE OBTAINED FROM THE VOLUME TABLE
               OF CONTENTS, FORMATTED AND DISPLAYED.  IF A NAME IS
               AN INDEX NAME, ALL DATA SETS BELOW THE INDEX WILL
               BE DISPLAYED.

               THE USER MAY BYPASS THE CATALOG SEARCH BY SUPPLYING
               THE VOLUME SERIAL ON WHICH THE DATA SET RESIDES.
               THIS OPTION PERMITS DISPLAYING INFORMATION FOR
               UNCATALOGED DATA SETS.

               THE ATTRIBUTES TO BE DISPLAYED MAY BE SELECTED BY
               THE USER WHEN HE ENTERS THE DSAT COMMAND BY
               SPECIFYING KEYWORD OPERANDS.

               THE DSAT COMMAND MAY BE USED IN COMMAND PROCEDURES
               TO FIND THE ALLOCATION OF A DATA SET OR A GROUP OF
               DATA SETS AND SET THE RETURN CODE TO THE SPECIFIED
               VALUE.  THE RETURN CODE MAY THEN BE TESTED WITH THE
               WHEN COMMAND.  OUTPUT MAY BE SUPPRESSED BY
               SPECIFYING NOPRINT.  THE HARDCOPY KEYWORD MAY BE USED
               TO DIRECT THE OUTPUT TO A PRE-ALLOCATED DATA SET.

               THE USER MAY CHOOSE WHAT INFORMATION WILL BE
               DISPLAYED BY ENTERING KEYWORDS.

               THE INFORMATION THAT MAY BE DISPLAYED IS:
                1. VOLUME SERIAL ON WHICH THE DATA SET IS LOCATED.
                2. FILE SEQUENCE NUMBER.
                3. DEVICE TYPE CODE FROM CATALOG ENTRY.
                4. ALLOCATION  (ALLOCATED, USED, AND EXTENTS).
                5. SECONDARY ALLOCATION (AMOUNT AND UNITS).
                6. DATA SET ORGANIZATION.
                7. DCB (RECFM, BLKSIZE, AND LRECL).
                8. CREATION DATE.
                9. EXPIRATION DATE.
               10. LAST DATE REFERENCED (MVS SU 60).
               11. FULLY QUALIFIED DATA SET NAME.
               12. CCHHR OF THE FORMAT 1 DSCB.
               13. GENERATION DATA GROUP DATA.
               14. PDS DIRECTORY INFORMATION.
