)F FUNCTION -

The DDT command invokes the DDT server under TSO. It is capable of
testing both TSO command processors and normal programs running in
the foreground under TSO. If you are testing a command processor,
you will be prompted to enter the command that you would have
entered to invoke the command processor.

)X SYNTAX -

  DDT 'DATA_SET_NAME(MEMBER)' 'PARM STRING' CP/NOCP

)O OPERANDS -

))'DATA_SET_NAME(MEMBER)' -

This required positional parameter specifies the data set and
member for the program to be tested. The data set must be a PDS,
and the member must belong to that PDS. If this parameter is not
enclosed in quotes, the data set name will be prefixed with your
TSO userid.

The data set name must be cataloged or have been previously
allocated to your TSO session.

))'PARM STRING' -

This optional positional parameter specifies the parameter string
to be passed to the program being debugged. This is the same value
you would specify with the EXEC PARM keyword if you were running
the program as a batch job. The parameter string is limited to
100 characters in length; the value will be folded to upper-case
characters.

The parameter string is ignored unless NOCP is specified.

))CP -

This keyword parameter indicates that the program being debugged
is a TSO command processor. This is the default for the DDT command.

))NOCP -

This keyword parameter indicates that the program being debugged
is a normal program and not a TSO command processor.

))NOTES -

See the MVSDDT manual for details on using the MVS Dynamic Debug Tool
and the TSO DDT command processor. The manual is part of the MVSDDT
Java client which can be installed on any Java RTE version 6 compliant
system using the installer found in TK4-.SHELBY.MVSDDT.V400.ZIP
