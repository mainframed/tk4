 -------------------- MEMBER LIST SELECTION CODES --------------------

 These selection codes can be used to select a member entry for
 processing from a directory member list display:

   S       - Selection code for selecting a member to be REVIEWed.

             'S' is the default selection code, and is assumed
             when the cursor is placed on an entry selection input
             field containing a period but no character is typed.

             With the 'REVED' TSO command selecting a PDS member
             with 'S' specifies that the member should be edited
             with REVEDIT.

   E       - Selection code for selecting a member to be edited.
             In an ISPF environment ISPF Edit is used;
             otherwise REVEDIT is used.

   B       - Selection code for selecting a member to be browsed.
             In an ISPF environment ISPF Browse is used;
             otherwise REVIEW is used.

   V       - Selection code for selecting a member to be viewed.
             In an ISPF environment ISPF View is used;
             otherwise REVEDIT is used in VIEW mode.

   U       - Selection code for selecting a member to be edited.
             REVEDIT is used.  REVEDIT will not process members
             with an undefined record format, or members allowed
             to have spanned records.

   D       - Selection code for deleting a member from an
             unconcatenated PDS (not a PDSE) such that it can be
             restored by the 'R' selection code.

   N       - Selection code for renaming a member from an
             unconcatenated PDS or data PDSE.  You will be
             prompted for the new name.

   T       - Selection code for tagging an entry for later processing.
             Tagged entries are shown in high intensity in the entry
             list.  If any members are tagged, then only tagged
             members are processed during offload (see OFFLOAD and
             SEQLOAD), delink (see DELINK) and search (see SEARCH)
             operations.  Further, tagging an entry may be useful for
             display control purposes when the entry list is large as
             RFIND can be used to locate the next tagged entry.  All
             tags can be cleared by REFRESH and RESET.

   R       - Selection code for restoring a deleted member and for
             resetting the tag status of an entry.  All tags can be
             cleared by REFRESH and RESET.  REFRESH will also clear
             display entries for deleted members meaning that they
             cannot be restored by the R selection code.

   H       - Selection code for displaying the history of a program.
             The Binder dialog API is used to extract identification
             record (IDR) data which contains compile, link edit and
             zap timestamped information.

             Under MVS/370, the HISTORY subcommand of the PDS command
             is used to produce the displayed output.

   M       - Selection code for displaying the module map of a program.
             The Binder dialog API is used to extract ESD class data
             for load modules and compatible program objects, or MAP
             class data from non-migratable program objects.

             Under MVS/370, the MAP subcommand of the PDS command
             is used to produce the displayed output.

   /       - Selection code for selecting a member to be REVIEWed
             as if the 'DATA' operand had been specified.  Normally,
             the DATA operand precludes access to PDS and PDSE member
             contents.  This selection code performs the same function
             as the 'S' selection code except that the DATA operand is
             deemed to have been specified.  This will prevent REVIEW
             from attempting to interpret data content such as
             pictures and ZIP directories.

=SEARCH=FIND=F
)F   The SEARCH subcommand causes a data entry screen to be presented
  where the parameters of a multi-member search can be specified.
  The facilities of the REVIEW FIND subcommand are used, and searched
  members are tagged when a match is found and untagged when no match
  is found.  If any members are tagged then only tagged members are
  searched.

     SEARCH
 Aliases  - FIND, F
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=RFIND=IFIND
)F   The RFIND subcommand performs one of two functions depending on
  whether any member display entries are currently tagged or not.

  If no members are tagged then RFIND reports the number of PDS
  directory blocks that were read.  If this read activity was not
  interrupted by the user the reported number represents the number
  of directory blocks which are used in the PDS, or in all PDSs in
  a concatenated file.

  If one or more members are tagged then RFIND positions the next
  tagged entry at the top of the display.  If the display is currently
  positioned at or past the last tagged entry then the display is
  positioned at the end-of-list entry.  If the display is currently
  positioned at the end-of-list entry then the display is positioned
  at the first tagged entry.

              ## is a 1 or 2 decimal digit number in the range of
              0 to 24 inclusive.  Numbers from 1 to 24 specify a
              particular Program Function Key.  If ## is 0 then
              all 24 PF Keys will be assigned their default values.

 'newpfdata'- Specifies the new subcommand for this PF Key.
=SCRNAME
)F   The SCRNAME subcommand allows a new name to be assigned to the
  active logical screen.  This name can be used as the operand of
  a SWAP subcommand.  Screen names are displayed by SWAP LIST.
)X Syntax -

              It should not be 'NEXT', 'PREV' or 'LIST'.
=START=SPLIT
)F   The START subcommand requests that a new parallel session is
  to be initiated and given control.  The new session will be under
  the RFE (REVIEW Front End) menu hierarchy.  The new session will
  NOT be started if it would cause the maximum logical session
  limit to be exceeded.  If no operand is supplied the RFE primary
  option menu is shown.
)X Syntax -
     START  'option'

 Alias    - SPLIT

             the exact member name must be specified.
               If no exact member name is found when the list is
             sorted by ID, then the operand is used to position
             the display to the matching user ID.
=SELECT=SEL=S
)F   SELECT allows a member to be selected for REVIEW from the primary
  input area without first locating the member's list entry in the

 Defaults - None.
 Required - 'member'
)O Operands -
)P 'member' -  The name of an existing member to be viewed.
=EDIT=E
)F   EDIT allows a member to be selected for edit from the primary
  input area without first locating the member's list entry in the
  display.  Only members in the first PDS or PDSE of a concatenation

)P 'member' -  The name of an existing or new member to be edited.
=DELINK=DL
)F   The DELINK subcommand instructs REVIEW to delink load modules
  and write object "decks" to a sequential data set.  The user will
  be prompted to specify an output data set.

  DELINK notes:
   1.  The subject PDS must have RECFM=U and must not be a PDSE.
   2.  Only tagged members are delinked, unless there are no
       tagged members in which case ALL MEMBERS are delinked.
   3.  REVIEW will attach the DELINKI program from CBT file 90
       to perform the delink function.  Fixed-length 80-byte
       records are written.  Note that SCATTER and OVERLAY
       programs will NOT be handled correctly.
   4.  If the resultant object data is relinked, the new load
       modules may not be bit-for-bit copies of the original
       load modules, even though they should be functionally
       equivalent.  That is, reconstructed load modules may be
       reblocked and/or reordered.
   5.  DELINKI can generate Program Binder control statements
       which are not supported by the Linkage Editor.

  to a sequential file.  Offloading can be performed for a
  partitioned data set or concatenation with ANY record format.
  The user will be prompted to specify an output data set.

  OFFLOAD notes:
   1.  The output RECFM will be overridden to FB or VB as appropriate.
       The output LRECL will be overridden to the PDS LRECL or 80,
       whichever is greater.  If the PDS has an undefined record
       format then fixed-length 80-byte records will be written.
   2.  Members will be offloaded in member selection list order,
       and will be preceded by an IEBUPDTE-like './ ADD ' control
       statement.
   3.  IEBUPDTE-like './ ALIAS ' statements are also generated only if
       the member list is sorted into TTR-order, and only for aliases
       whose corresponding real member is also offloaded.
   4.  Only the first occurrence of a given member name in a
       concatenation can be offloaded.
   5.  OVERLAY programs and program objects cannot be offloaded.
   6.  Only tagged members are offloaded, unless there are no
       tagged members in which case ALL MEMBERS are offloaded.
   7.  If the first two (2) data bytes of a fixed-length or
       variable-length record are './' then they will be
       translated to '><' on output.

 Alias    - OFF
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=SEQLOAD=SEQ
)F   The SEQLOAD subcommand instructs REVIEW to copy PDS members
  contents to a sequential file.  Sequentialising  can be performed
  for a partitioned data set or concatenation with fixed-length or
  variable-length records.  The user will be prompted to specify
  an output data set.

  SEQLOAD notes:
   1.  The output RECFM will be overridden to FB or VB as appropriate.
       The output LRECL will be overridden to the PDS LRECL.
   2.  The data from real members will be written in member selection
       list order.
   3.  Only the first occurrence of a given member name in a
       concatenation can be copied.
   4.  Only tagged members are copied, unless there are no tagged
       members in which case ALL MEMBERS are copied.
   5.  'SEQLOAD' performs the same processing as 'OFFLOAD' except
       that no IEBUPDTE-like control statements are generated, './'
       is not translated on output, and the minimum output LRECL of
       80 required by 'OFFLOAD' for IEBUPDTE compatibility is not
       required by 'SEQLOAD'.  'SEQLOAD' cannot process RECFM=U
       libraries.

 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=PDSLOAD=PDS
)F   The PDSLOAD subcommand instructs REVIEW to process sequential
  input and load the data into members of the library being REVIEWed,
  which must not be a concatenation.  The user is prompted with a
  panel to specify the data set containing the sequential input,
  whether ISPF statistics are to be generated, and an optional member
  name selection mask.

  PDSLOAD notes:
   1.  The input is expected to be data created by OFFLOAD or a
       compatible offload process.
   2.  REVIEW will attach the PDSLOAD program from CBT file 93 (or
       the REVLMOD program if the PDS RECFM=U) to perform the reload
       operation.
   3.  Load modules reconstructed by this subcommand will be
       bit-for-bit copies of the original load modules.  No
       reblocking is performed for load modules.
   4.  See PDSLOAD documentation for details on fixed- and
       variable-length record format combinations, and record
       truncation and extension actions.

=SORT
)F   The SORT subcommand causes the displayed directory entries to be
  reordered according to the specified criterion.  Underscored column
  headings may be selected as the sorting criterion without typing
  a SORT command by means of cursor placement.
)X Syntax -
     SORT  'sort-field'

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - None.
 Required - 'sort-field'
)O Operands -
)P 'sort-field' - The name of the display field to be used for sorting.
      Valid sort field names are:
  NAME or N - Sort the list into ascending name order.
  CHA  or C - Sort the list into descending change timestamp order.
  DATE or D - Sort the list into descending change timestamp order.
  SIZE or S - Sort the list into descending size order.
  TTR  or T - Sort the list into ascending TTR order.  This is
              the order that the members were saved into the PDS.
  ID   or I - Sort the list into ascending UserId order.
  USER or U - Sort the list into ascending UserId order.
  SSI or SS - Sort the list into ascending SSI or VV.MM order.
  VER  or V - Sort the list into ascending SSI or VV.MM order.
