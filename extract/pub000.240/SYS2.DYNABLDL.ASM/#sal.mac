.*
.*   THIS MACRO CAUSES IBM'S STANDARD STAND ALONE LOADER (THE
.* "BOOTSTRAP" LOADER) TO BE PUNCHED. NO OPERANDS ARE ACCEPTED BY THIS
.* MACRO. THE CALL TO THIS MACRO SHOULD BE PLACED PRIOR TO ANY START OR
.* CSECT CARD.
.*
.* THE LOADER PUNCHED BY THIS MACRO IS THE SAME LOADER DISTRIBUTED BY
.* IBM WITH THE IBCDASDI AND IBCDMPRS UTILITIES. THE FOLLOWING
.* INFORMATION IS PERTENANT:
.* - THE LOADER CONSISTS OF SIX CARDS. IT MUST BE PLACED IMMEDIATELY
.*   PRECEEDING THE DECK TO BE LOADED.
.* - THE LOADER WILL LOAD SUCCESSFULLY FROM ANY CARD READER OR TAPE
.*   DRIVE. IF A TAPE DRIVE IS USED, THEN BOTH THE LOADER AND THE DECK
.*   BEING LOADED MUST BE IN THE FORM OF 80-BYTE UNBLOCKED CARD IMAGES.
.* - THE LOADER LOADS SINGLE OBJECT DECKS INTO CORE AT THE ABSOLUTE
.*   ADDRESSES DEFINED IN THE DECK ITSELF.
.* - THE LOADER ITSELF RESIDES BETWEEN X'7C20' AND X'7D9C', SO THE DECK
.*   BEING LOADED MUST NO OVERLAY THESE LOCATIONS.
.* - THE DECK BEING LOADED MUST DEFINE AN INITIAL PSW LOCATED AT
.*   LOCATION X'0'. IT MAY ALSO DEFINE ANY INTERRUPT OLD AND NEW PSW'S
.*   THAT IT REQUIRES EXCEPT FOR THE EXTERNAL INTERRUPT PSW'S SINCE
.*   THESE MIGHT BE OVERLAID IF THE LOADER ENCOUNTERS AN I/O ERROR
.*   DURING ITS PROCESSING.
.* - IF DURING THE LOADING PROCESS AN I/O ERROR DOES OCCURE, THEN THE
.*   LOADER WAITS FOR AN EXTERNAL INTERRUPT UPON WHICH A RE-READ IS
.*   ATTEMPTED.
.* - THE VARIOUS TYPES OF OBJECT CARDS ARE RECOGNIZED BY TESTING ONLY
.*   COLUMN THREE OF EACH CARD.
.* - ESD CARDS ARE IGNORED. NO ATTEMPT IS MADE TO DEAL WITH EXTERNAL
.*   REFERENCES.
.* - RLD CARDS ARE ALSO IGNORED. SINCE ALL RELATIVE ADDRESSES IN THE
.*   OBJECT DECK ARE TREATED AS BEING ABSOLUTE, RLD INFORMATION IS
.*   SIMPLY NOT NEEDED.
.* - THE FOLLOWING TXT FIELDS ARE USED. NEEDLESS TO SAY, THEY CONTAIN
.*   BINARY DATA.
.*   +DISPL(LEN) - USAGE
.*   +2(1)       - MUST BE THE CHARACTER "X" TO IDENTIFY THE CARD
.*   +4(4)       - MUST BE THE ABSOLUTE STARTING ADDRESS FOR THE
.*                 FOLLOWING TEXT DATA
.*   +10(2)      - MUST BE THE LENGTH (IN BYTES) OF THE TEXT DATA
.*   +16(---)    - MUST BE THE TEXT DATA TO BE LOADED
.* - THE END CARD CAUSES THE LOADER TO DO THE FOLLOWING:
.*   - THE IPL DEVICE ADDRESS IS STORED AT LOCATION +2(2).
.*   - A PSW IS LOADED FROM LOCATION +0(8).
.* - IF A CARD IS OTHERWISE UNRECOGNIZABLE, THEN IT IS ASSUMED TO BE A
.*   MANUALLY KEYPUNCHED REP CARD. SUCH CARDS MUST HAVE THE FOLLOWING
.*   FORMAT:
.*   +6(6)       - THE ABSOLUTE ADDRESS (IN HEX) FOR THE START OF THE
.*                 REP DATA
.*   +16(---)    - CONSECUATIVE 4-DIGIT FIELDS (SEPERATED BY COMMAS) OF
.*                 HEX REP DATA.
.*   THE REP DATA MUST BE GIVEN IN UNITS OF 4-DIGIT (2-BYTE) FIELDS.
.*   THE REP ADDRESS NEED NOT, HOWEVER, BE HALFWORD ALIGNED. NO
.*   VALIDITY CHECKING WHATSOEVER IS DONE. INVALID REP DATA WILL RESULT
.*   IN EITHER UNEXPECTED REP'S OR PROGRAM CHECK LOOPS. LEADING ZEROS
.*   MUST BE SUPPLIED. EXAMPLES:
.*    000341    1234,ABCD,EFGH
.*    01ABCC    8888
.*   REP CARDS MAY BE FREELY INTERMIXED INTO THE OBJECT DECK.
.*
.* INNER MACROS USED - NONE
