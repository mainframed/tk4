clock (off) -- Set time control parameters

"clock" is used for playing tournament level games using a chess clock.
The command prompts for the number of moves and minutes to
the next time control.
Duchess attempts to finish 20 minutes ahead
of time control, and assumes 10 seconds/move operator overhead.
Every 5 moves Duchess asks how much time is left on the official
clock, and when time control is reached "clock" is reinvoked.

"clock" is inappropriate for fast games.
"clock off" cancels "clock" and probably has bugs.
