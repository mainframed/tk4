ttreset [ n ] -- clear and set size of position table.

"ttreset" causes Duchess to clear its position table.
This is useful when doing problem positions.

If "n" is given, it is the new length (bytes) of the position table.
The value of "n" is first truncated to a multiple of
the length of a postion table entry,
and is increased if necessary so that there are
some minimum number of entries (viz. 7).
