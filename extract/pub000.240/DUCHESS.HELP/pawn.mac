The Pawn has a number of pecularities about it.
It is the only man which can move only forward,
and it is the only man which can be traded in for another piece
when it reaches the other side (like the man in checkers).
It normally moves one square forward,
except when it is capturing another man
or if it is exercising its option of making two forward moves,
which can only be done when the Pawn moves from its original square.
Capturing is accomplished by moving diagonally,
displacing the captured piece.
This also can only be done one square at a time;
also, only enemy pieces may be captured
(a restriction also applied to the pieces).
Occasionally, however,
the Pawn can capture another Pawn without displacing it:
this is known as the "en passant" rule.
If, on the previous move, the opponent moved one of his Pawns
two squares (from its original square),
and is next to one of your Pawns horizontally,
your Pawn can move as if the enemy Pawn had only moved one square,
and capture it.
The option can no longer be used if it is not immediately acted on.
When a Pawn reaches the last rank, it must be traded in for another man,
with the exception of a Pawn or a King.
This can be any piece of your choosing,
regardless of the file the Pawn is in
or how many of that kind of piece is already on the board.

A word of advice:  Many amateurs push Pawns too much.
Remember that the Pawn can never retreat from danger.
Never treat a Pawn too lightly,
for although it is the weakest man on the board,
it can be promoted into the strongest.
