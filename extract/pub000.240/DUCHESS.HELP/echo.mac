echo (on off) file1 file2 -- File copying

"echo on a b" causes any input or output on file "a"
to be output to file "b".
"echo off a b" cancels this action.
Example:
"echo on SYSIN SYSPRINT" copies input from SYSIN to SYSPRINT
and may be used as an "echo check" of parity errors.
Infinite echo loops are not allowed,
but arbitrary echo chains (diagraphs) could still be harmful.
