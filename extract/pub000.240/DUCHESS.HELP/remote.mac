remote facility -- Interactive/batch execution

The remote facility was designed to bypass memory and other
limitations resulting from interactive (TSO) execution.
In the Eighth North American Computer Chess Championship
Duchess executed in a 1000k batch region alone on one IBM 370/165
and communicated via the file REMOTE to a TSO program
on another IBM 370/165.

The file REMOTE is two fixed 82 byte records.
If the file is allocated to Duchess,
SYSIN and SYSPRINT are redirected to it.
The program "REMOTE" also redirects SYSIN and SYSPRINT
to the file REMOTE.
The effect is that of a direct connection
from SYSIN and SYSPRINT to Duchess (with a communication delay).
It is not necessary that Duchess run in batch,
or that the program "REMOTE" run in TSO.

There are several CLIST entries to facilitate this procedure.
CLIST(BATCH) submits the batch job for execution.
CLIST(BATCHJCL) is the JCL actually submitted.
CLIST(REMOTE) invokes the program "REMOTE".
(The JCL procedure is installation dependent.)

Versions 6.08.00 and later use a new REMOTE format
so earlier versions no longer work with the "REMOTE" program.

Due to a flaw in OS/MVT, use of the STIMER macro,
with WAIT=REAL, is forbidden under TSO at TUCC.
This prevents use of the REMOTE facility (at TUCC)
without special arrangements.
