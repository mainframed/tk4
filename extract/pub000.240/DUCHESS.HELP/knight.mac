The Knight is the sneak attacker of the game.
It is the only man which can leap over other men,
though it captures by replacing
the captured man as if it had only made a normal move,
like all other men with the exception of the Pawn.
The Knight moves one square horizontally or vertically,
and one square diagonally away from its original square;
some people also describe its moves (just as exactly)
as moving two squares horizontally or vertically
and one square perpendicular to that path.
