anticipation (on off) -- Control computation on opponent time

"anticipation on" causes the program to compute a reply to
the predicted opponent move.
If there is no prediction anticipation is not done.
If the opponent makes the predicted move the time spent anticipating
is saved; otherwise the time is (largely) wasted.
Anticipation causes asynchronous operation (see asynchronous).

"anticipation off" cancels "anticipation on".
If an anticipation search is in progress
it will continue until a new search cancels it.

Warning
Anticipation is extremely cpu intensive

Anticipation requires either the REMOTE facility,
or a TCAM access method (TGET).
Some commands may not work correctly
when anticipation is on.
