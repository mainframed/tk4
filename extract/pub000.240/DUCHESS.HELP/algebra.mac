Algebraic notation -
The squares are all named from white's Qr1, for both white and black.
The files (vertical lines) are named "a" through "h"
with "a" being the file on the extreme left for white.
The ranks (horizontal lines) are named "1" through "8",
with the row of white pieces being "1".
The move starts with the piece moving,
then the square it is moving from,
a dash ("-"), and then the square it is moving to.
If a move Queens a Pawn,
the piece to which it promotes is appended to the move.
Examples of algebraic notation:
         Pe2-e4   (white's Pawn to King four, or P-K4.)
         Pe7-e5   (black's Pawn to King four, or P-K4.)
         Ra1-a4:  (Rook to King Rook four captures, or RxB(KR4).)
         Nf3-e5#  (Knight to King five mates, or N-K5 mate.)
         Pg7-h8Q: (Pawn to QR8 captures promotes, or PxR=Q.)

Abbreviated algebraic -
To indicate a Pawn move,
specify the square to which the Pawn is moving
(e.g. "e4" instead of "Pe2-e4").
To indicate a Pawn capture specify the column the Pawn is on,
the column the piece being captured is on,
and then optionally the row the piece is on
(e.g. "ab" or "ab5" instead of "Pa4-b5:").
For other pieces (optionally for Pawns), specify the piece moving,
then optionally the row or column from which the piece is moving,
and then the square to which the piece is moving
(e.g. "Nc3" or "Nbc3" or "N1c3" instead of "Nb1-c3").
