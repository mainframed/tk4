history (n) -- Print game history

The "initialize" and "update" commands establish a base
position for the game history.
In the former case the base position is the opening and in the
latter case it is whatever problem position the user types in.
Moves by the user or Duchess are recorded in the game history.
"history" prints the entire game score.
"history n" prints the last n half-moves.

Other history-resetting commands are
"zero" and "swapsides".

If at least 5 computer moves have been added to history
since the last history-resetting command (or "history" command),
a history-resetting command
will ask the user if history should be printed first.
