asynchronous (on off) -- Control interaction during search

"asynchronous on" permits the following commands
to be typed when the program is searching and not requesting input:
  "what" causes printout of results of the most recent search.
  "go"   causes the search to return immediately with a move.

"asynchronous off" cancels asynchronous on.

The asynchronous feature is also active whenever anticipation is on.

Bugs: See anticipation
