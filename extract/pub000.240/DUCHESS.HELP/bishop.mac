The Bishop is the only piece limited
to moving on a single color of square.
It may move any number of squares in a diagonal direction,
as long as it does not leap over another man;
it captures a piece if
that piece is so unlucky as to be standing where the Bishop stops.
Of course, the Bishop may elect not to move the full legal distance.
Each side gets two Bishops, one for each color of square.
