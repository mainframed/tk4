The Queen is the most powerful piece on the chessboard
(women's lib, please take note).
She moves "like a Bishop and Rook combined" or in
other words, she moves any number of squares horizontally, vertically,
or diagonally in a straight line, and captures as she moves.
The Queen can not leap over occupied squares.
Normally, when a Pawn is promoted, it is promoted to a Queen,
so it is possible to have
as many as nine Queens on the board for one side!
Many amateurs are so impressed with the awesome power of the Queen
that they send her off to remote corners of the board
to chase lowly Pawns.
This practice is not recommended,
since the Queen can be trapped and go lost
if one does not play extremely accurately,
and her power is such that her loss (without adequate compensation)
is almost as bad as loss of the game;
and even if she does not go lost,
her absence from a more important field of battle may be fatal.
