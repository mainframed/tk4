moves ( s c a ... ) -- List generated moves

"moves"  lists the moves generated by the full move generator.
The "c" option requests the capture generator be used instead.
The "s" option requests the moves be sorted by the move sorter.
The "a" option requests all moves be listed;
ordinarily, the illegal moves generated are suppressed.
