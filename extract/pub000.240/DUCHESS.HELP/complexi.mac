complexity n -- Set maximum search complexity

In Duchess 6.08.00 a complexity of 100 is approximately 1 ply.
Hence "complexity 500" restricts Duchess to a 5 ply search
(followed by captures and promotions with no depth limit).
A search may be terminated by "time" or "clock" rather than complexity.
"time c 1" and "complexity 3000" is default.
