The game of chess is played on an 8x8 board with squares customarily
colored white and black.
The two teams are also usually colored white and black.
Each side has an army of 16 men, consisting of:
     8 Pawns symbolized by WP (white) and BP (black).
     8 pieces of the following values:
       2 Knights symbolized by WN (white) and BN (black).
       2 Bishops symbolized by WB and BB.
       2 Rooks symbolized by WR and BR.
       1 Queen symbolized by WQ and BQ.
       1 King  symbolized by WK and BK.
(The Duchess board printout uses " P" for white and "-P" for black.)
The pieces are set up at the beginning of the game as follows:

-R-N-B-Q-K-B-N-R
-P-P-P-P-P-P-P-P
 : * : * : * : *
 * : * : * : * :

 P P P P P P P P
 R N B Q K B N R

Note that the board is customarily shown with white at the bottom and
black at the top, and that the Queen of each side is placed on the
same color as that side.
White customarily moves first.
To find the moves of each piece, enter "help piece"
where "piece" is Pawn, Knight, Bishop, Rook, Queen, or King.
