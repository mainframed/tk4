When Duchess initiates it prints the stamp and
the size of the position table in bytes and entries.
When Duchess terminates it prints the stamp and exits.
In between Duchess executes a loop with two cases ...

1.  Duchess is not to move

The program prints "W.command:" (or "B.command:" if black is
to move) and reads a command from SYSIN.
A typical command is "board" which prints the chess board.
Since commands may be abbreviated "boar" and "boa" are acceptable,
but "bo" and "b" are not since they are ambiguous with "both".
A command is delimited by end-of-line or semicolon.

An unknown command is assumed to be a move.
The move is verified, added to history, and made on the board.
The side to move is changed.

2.  Duchess is to move  (see white, black, both, neither)

Duchess will compute a move, add it to history, make it on the
board, and change the side to move.
Duchess computes a move in one of several different ways ...

If there is exactly one legal move it is used.

If BOOK lookup succeeds the move returned is used.

Otherwise a tree search is invoked to obtain a move
(See time, clock, complexity).
In Duchess v 6.08.00 the move printout is preceeded by ...

targ   -- time Duchess wants to take on this move
ratio  -- factor used to estimate time of next iteration
tcut   -- minimum search time

... and is followed by ...

val    -- evaluation of predicted position (+100 is up 1 Pawn)
cplx   -- complexity (approximately ply*100) of exhaustive search
time   -- cpu time/real time  utilization(%)  for this move
tcpu   -- total cpu time used on Duchess's time
hashes -- number of position table lookups
evals  -- number of static evaluations
s      -- total cpu time "saved" by anticipation
w      -- total cpu time "wasted" by anticipation

Exceptional conditions:
"search stack overflow" means bigger search stack is needed.
"ttable overflow" means bigger position table is needed.
"Duchess ended due to error" shouldn't happen.
