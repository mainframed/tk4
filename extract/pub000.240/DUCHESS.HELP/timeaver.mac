timeaverage (off c r) (n) -- Control time averaging

"time c 5" averages 5 cpu seconds per
computer move and is used to play blitz chess.
"time r 60" averages 60 "real" seconds per
computer move and is used rarely.
"time off" disables time averaging
so only "complexity" limits search size.

Averaging is done so that,
while each move may be far from the requested "n",
the average of a series of moves will be fairly close to "n".
