*** Explain illegal moves better (King in check stops O-O, etc).
 Ditto for ambiguous moves.

*** Change tree search so 2-fold repetition is not always scored
 as simply a draw (as 3-fold repetition).

*** Have 2 entry points to putchar, getchar, and other routines which
 are passed a fow so a default fow may be used conveniently.

*** Create a global data area ("common") which contains
 variables used frequently by more than one routine,
 then have a pointer to this area in a standard register (r11?).
 This will reduce the v-constant loading that ocurrs so often.

*** Provide a mechanism for two different versions of Duchess
 to compete against each other.
 One method might be to have the two versions run in remote mode
 with a supervisor program in between controlling what each version
 receives as input.

*** Add commands which store and retrieve game status in a file.

*** General stuff:
 Adjust material balance so trade down bonus is stronger.
 Opening BOOK has numerous bad lines.
 Anticipation could be done better:
  If there is no predicted opponent move, program could compute one.
   (Interesting problem -- how long should it take to predict?)
  If it has spent "enough" time anticipating one move,
   it could switch to other plausible opponent moves.
 Program should take less time on "obvious moves".

*** improve help utility:
 Catch interrupts (this might be generally useful).
 "help **" prints everything.

*** Permit a command at 'game history?' prompt.
 This would override earlier command (e.g. init).

*** Reply if anticipation success, but more time required
 (e.g. "Saved 1:23.14".

*** Have a value threshold before switching moves from
 one iteration to the next.

*** Bdev:
 Blocked piece penalty.
 minor pieces or pawns blocking open/semi-open file.
 Side to move should get a few points.
 Castling term should be improved.

*** Add convenience commands:
 'game' or 'play' -- asks for color, for move, etc.
 'tournament' command -- sets up for tournament play.

*** Improve search trace printout.

*** Pre-sort bottom moves?

*** Window compression of search value:
 sv should be original bound if search cutoff.
