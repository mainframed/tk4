slave facility -- Remote monitoring of Duchess output

The file SLAVE is RECFM=F, LRECL=BLKSIZE=92.
If allocated to Duchess and:
     echo on SYSIN SLAVE; echo on SYSPRINT SLAVE
are typed,
then SYSIN and SYSPRINT io is copied to the SLAVE file,
which is a circular file 50 records long
with each record stamped with the time it was written.

The program "SLAVE" examines the file SLAVE
and prints the most recent records.
The effect is that of a delayed copy
of the Duchess output (syntax errors and all).
This facility is useful for monitoring the program
when it is competing in a tournament
far from where you happen to be.

Bugs
Due to a flaw in OS/MVT, STIMER with WAIT=REAL
no longer works under TSO at TUCC.
That means the SLAVE facility no longer works.
However, the MONITOR command at TUCC may be used instead.
Currently, a user can type MONITOR USER(DUCHESS6) KEY(DUCHESS6).
