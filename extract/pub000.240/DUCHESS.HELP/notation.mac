Duchess accepts both algebraic and descriptive notation.
These notations may be used interchangeably during a game.
However, Duchess prints moves in algebraic only.

All notations use the following letter code to indicate pieces:
P=Pawn, N=Knight, B=Bishop, R=Rook, Q=Queen, and K=King.
A castle King-side is O-O, and a castle Queen-side is O-O-O.

Special notations: (these are optional but must be correct if used.)
Check - append "+".
Checkmate - append "++".
Pawn promotion - (must be appended before all other special notations)
     append the piece promoted to (e.g. "e8Q"),
     or append "/" or "=" and then the piece promoted to,
     or enclose the piece code in parentheses.
     examples: "PxR/Q", "PxR(Q)", "PxR=Q", "PxR(R8)/Q".

For a listing of descriptive notation rules, see "descript".
