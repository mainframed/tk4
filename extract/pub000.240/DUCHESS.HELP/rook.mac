The Rook is one of the so-called "major pieces"
which also includes the Queen.
It may move any number of squares horizontally or vertically,
capturing on the square it lands on if an enemy piece is there.
It may not leap over occupied squares,
whether the square is occupied by its own side or the enemy's.
It is best not to bring out the major pieces (Rook and Queen)
until some definite advantage is to be gained, as they can,
in spite of their strength,
be easily trapped by resourceful Pawns, Knights, and Bishops.
