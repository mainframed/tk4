log facility -- Logging information on Duchess users

If the files LOG and SYSLIST are allocated,
then when Duchess initiates
the user's account and name are written to SYSLIST.

The file LOG is not read or written by Duchess;
it serves as a flag to control the whether logging is performed.

The log facility is system dependent,
so most installations will need to modify the program
before it can be used.
