-- Extracting Duchess distribution from magnetic tape --

The distribution tape was created with IEHMOVE.
CLIST(MTPUTJCL) was the JCL submitted to do this.
There are seven datasets on the tape:
LOAD -- PDS of assembly and load modules (includes DUCHESS6).
BOOK -- direct access openings library (IBM 3350 disk)
HELP -- PDS of documentation
CLIST -- PDS of TSO procedures
MACLIB -- PDS of assembly macros
SOURCE -- PDS of Duchess source modules
BK -- PDS of Duchess openings library (human readable)

The JCL in CLIST(MTGETJCL) is used to extract these datasets.
MTGETJCL should be edited to change $DISK, $NEWPREFIX, and $DTAPE.

If you are unable to get BOOK onto disk correctly,
it can be recreated by running the JCL in CLIST(BOOKJCL).

Once the datasets have been extracted and catalogued
Duchess should be ready to execute.
