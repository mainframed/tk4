Duchess requires an IBM system/360 or equivalent.
There are no system/370 or floating point instructions.
The program should execute on most OS-type systems.

The following operating system functions are used:
 function                 module
GETMAIN                  COMMAND
search through "TIOT"    COMMAND
OPEN/CLOSE/io            COMMAND, DRIVERS, HELP
STIMER, TTIMER           SYSTEM
TIME                     SYSTEM
ABEND                    (all over the place)
(there are probably others)

Duchess will execute in 150k bytes; however, 200k is recommended and
the program will use available memory up to 12 megabytes.
Virtual memory is probably unhealthy for Duchess.
The GETMAIN should get only real (fast) memory.

The load module DUCHESS6 (in LOAD PDS) is sufficient for execution.
The files SYSIN and SYSPRINT need to be allocated.

The BOOK file may be allocated to improve play.

Other files, described elsewhere, may also be allocated.

The CLIST PDS contains various utilities
which are installation dependent and may require changes:
CLIST(CHESS) invokes the chess program
CLIST(LPR) prints and truncates SYSLIST file
CLIST(AS) reassembles a Duchess module
CLIST(LN) creates a test version of Duchess ("D6")
