SYSLIST facility -- Hard copy of Duchess output

The file SYSLIST is RECFM=FBA, LRECL=133, BLKSIZE=2660.
If SYSLIST is allocated to Duchess
a copy of SYSIN and SYSPRINT will be written to it.
Syslist is also the output file for the user log (see log)
and the "statistics" and "trace" commands.

This facility is useful for maintaining a history of program usage
as well as providing hardcopy output for important games.
It may be used to generate statistics interactively
without clogging up SYSPRINT with tables upon tables.

CLIST(LPR) may be used to print the SYSLIST file
(multiple copies allowed) and then reallocate it.
CLIST(LPRJCL) is the JCL actually submitted.
These routines are operating system dependent.
