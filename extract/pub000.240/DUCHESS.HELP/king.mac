The object of the game of chess is to checkmate the King, e.g.,
to place him under attack so that he cannot escape.
The King is rather weak, able to move only one square in any direction,
except when castling, which is allowed once per game for each side.
In this move, the King is moved two squares horizontally,
and the Rook toward which he moved
is placed between him and his original square.
Castling becomes permanently impossible after it is done once,
or the King moves (even if he later returns to his original square),
or is impossible on one side only when that Rook moves.
The move is temporarily illegal if the King is in check (under attack),
or if he would move into check or over check
(a square attacked by the enemy),
or if the squares between the King and the Rook are occupied.
In these cases, if the checking piece is captured or its attack blocked,
or if the occupied squares are vacated, castling again becomes legal.
Note that the Rook, by contrast,
can move out of an attack or over an attack in castling,
contrary to many false rumors.
The game is considered won when the King is placed under attack
such that he cannot escape in any way, whether by moving out,
or having someone in his army capture or block the attacker.
The game is also considered won when one side concedes
that his opponent's material advantage
is sufficient to force the above situation;
this concession must be accepted.
The game is drawn if one side has no legal moves
(putting the King into check is not a legal move)
and its King is not in check.
Other methods by which the game may be considered drawn
(which are sometimes erroneously called stalemate)
include mutual consent, when both players concede that they cannot win,
the three-fold repitition rule,
which states that if the same position is reached three times
in the course of a game, the game is declared drawn;
and the fifty move rule,
which provides that if each side makes fifty moves
without a man being captured or a Pawn moved,
the game is declared drawn.
The relative values of the pieces are:
         Pawn=1, Knight=3, Bishop=3, Rook=5, Queen=9, King=infinite.
These values are not strictly true, but form a good generalization:
however, if only a Knight can deliver mate,
it would not do much good to have only Queens and Rooks,
even though they usually have more power than the Knight.
