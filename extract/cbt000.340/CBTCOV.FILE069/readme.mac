 Two important things that need to be checked before starting any
 partitioning proceedure are:

 1. RSU parameter in parmlib member IEASYSxx must be correct or
    partitioning will fail. The formula for calculating it is:

          Total installed central storage in M bytes
    RSU = ------------------------------------------
                 2 * storage increment size

    Storage increment size for a 400 is 2M.
    Storage increment size for a 400E/600E is 4M.

    See 3090 Processor Complex - Recovery Guide - SC38-0051 - page 2-14

 2. If you have 3725's attached to your 3090 that don't have a
    multi-processor switch to allow more than one channel path
    to be enabled at the same time, you will need to incorporate
    instructions on how to switch them. This usually means you will
    have to bring down VTAM, so in this case you may want to just
    IPL the machine in partitioned mode and avoid the more complicated
    dynamic partitioning process.
