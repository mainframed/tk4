0  TO PARTITION SIDE 1 OFF (SIDE 0 = ONGOING, SIDE 1 = OFFGOING) --
    * All references in red IBM International Technical Support Centers
      manual titled 'System Recovery Procedures'. GG24-3096
      There is a SAMPLE complete procedure on pages 91-95.
0  1. Check the 2914 to make sure that all switches are switched to
      side 0. Currently, switches A, B, C, F and G, which are the
      switches for the printer type devices, should be switched to 3.
      Switch E which is for the 3274's, should be switched to 2.
      If they are not switched correctly, see NOTE 1 on page 2.
      * Reference - Page 63 - SWITCHING ASYMMETRICAL DEVICES
0  2. Enter the following command on MVS master operator console:
      V NET,INACT,ID=H056LDC1,I
0  3. Enter the following command on MVS master operator console:
      CF MEMBER(P1)
      * Reference - Page 62 - SPECIFYING A CONFIG MEMBER
0  4. Watch for message IEE712I CONFIG PROCESSING COMPLETE
      to show completion of command in #3.
      If you do not see this message after about 10 minutes or if you
      see any of the following messages, further action is required
      before proceeding.
0  -- IEE575A CONFIG STORAGE WAITING TO COMPLETE - REPLY C TO CANCEL
      This message will come and go, but if it stays on the screen
      for more than 1 minute, it means that there is a job holding
      some storage the system is trying to reconfigure. Use the
      D M=STOR command to display the job that is holding the storage.
      You should see the following display:
0     IEE490I HH.MM.SS DISPLAY M     PENDING STATUS DUE TO
                                     yyyyyK-yyyyyK,asid=xx,jobname=jjjj
0     If you wish partitioning to complete, you will need to cancel
      the job shown in the above message. When you do, you will see the
      IEE575A message disappear. The 3 jobs that usually show up and
      need to be cancelled are TELE056A, SNDM and ELD.
      Repeat this process as many times as necessary

0     Use the D M=CHP(41) to display the devices on chpid 41 that
      are still online and vary them inactive in VTAM and then offline
      to the system. Then enter the command CF CHP(41),OFF,UNCOND
      which will now vary the chpid offline. Currently, this is the only
      chpid that should give you trouble.

0  5. Enter the following command on MVS master operator console:
      CF MEMBER(C1). This will show you any components on side 1 that
      didn't go offline. Once you see the message IEE079I NO DEVIATION
      FROM CONFIGURATION, then you can proceed to step 6.
0  6. Select the PARCTL frame on the 3090 system console using the
      INDEX frame.
0  7. Enter A1,B1 to vary OFF side 1. You will receive a PRIORITY
      MESSAGE showing completion of the task.
      * Reference - Page 95 - VARY SIDE OFF
      NOTE: If you receive a message requesting you to reply X1 to
      confirm, DO NOT reply with X1 as this means there is something
      wrong. Call someone in Software support.
0  8. Hit the END key. You will then see an IBM logo until the side B
      initialization is complete.
0  9. To activate side 1 as a separate system you must do a POR and
      then the normal IPL on SIDE 1. Make sure the console you are
      using is the one looking at SIDE 1 and that you are using the
      correct IOCDS member. (accessed from CONFIG frame)
0 10. To complete the partitioning, after you have gone through all
      of the above steps, enter the following command on a console.
      S SITOPP0   This will set some system parameters for running
      the system on only one side.
0  NOTE 1 - If 2914 is not switched properly, you will need to change
      it before proceeding. Do the following:
0  -- FOR SWITCHES A,B,C,F and G, vary the device that is not properly
      switched, OFFLINE then switch the switch to the correct position
      and vary the device back ONLINE. You may need to vary the
      new path(s) online first if the vary online command doesn't work.
      Then reissue the vary ONLINE command again.
0  -- FOR SWITCH E which controls the switchable local terminals, issue
      the commands:   V NET,INACT,ID=H056LDC,I
                      V 680-69F,OFFLINE
                      V 6C0-6DF,OFFLINE
      Then switch the switch to the correct position and issue the
      commands:       V PATH(680-69F,1F),ONLINE
                      V PATH(6C0-6DF,1F),ONLINE
                      V NET,ACT,ID=H056LDC
