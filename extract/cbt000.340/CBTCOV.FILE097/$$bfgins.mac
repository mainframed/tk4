To install the basic version of QUEUE, you need to do the following
things:

1.  Restore the library from tape. (Of course you already did this
    to be able to read these instructions.)

2.  Customize QSTART if necessary. NOTE, if not customized, QUEUE
    will look for the cataloged SYS1.HASPCKPT and subsystem JES2.

3.  Customize AUTH if necessary in your shop.

4.  Customize member $BFGJCL which will assemble and link all the
    QUEUE modules. It will produce two load modules (Q7, and QUEUECMN).

5.  For more information see member $$INST.


To install the ISPF interface:

1.  Customize member $BFGJCLI which will assemble and link the
    module ISRQ. This should be put in a library that will be
    STEPLIB/TASKLIB, or LINKLIST/LPALIB. The two modules of QUEUE
    also need to be accessable.

2.  Copy the following members to a ISPF panel library:

    a.     BFTQU000 -     Tutorial menus for ISPF
             BFTQU073

    b.     BFGPG000       Sample menu to invoke ISPF QUEUE as one
                          of many functions.

    c.     BFCG010        Clist invoked by panel BFGPG000. It displays
                          the next panel only for software users.

    d.     BFGPNL         Panel to invoke QUEUE and specify optional
                          parameters. (Great for JES maintenance
                          personel, but should be skiped for general
                          users, which the clist does.)

    e.     QNM1           QUEUE's table display menu. NOTE, THIS NAME
                          IS FIXED IN THE CODE (field TBPNL in
                          QCOMMON). The PFKeys are defaulted to the
                          normal QUEUE keys.
