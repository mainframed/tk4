ISPF  -- IMPLEMENTED AN INTERFACE BETWEEN ISPF/PDF AND THE QUEUE COMMAND
         ** SEE MEMBER $BFGISPF FOR MORE INFO **

BFG01 -- CHANGED METHOD TO READ THE CKPT FILE TO EXCP. IT PROVIDES
         NOTICABLE IMPROVEMENT TO THE SPEED OF QUEUE.
         (INIT,CKPT,QCOMMON)

BFG02 -- ADDED COUNT OF DUPLICATE JOBS TO THE DQ COMMAND.
         (SEARCH)

BFG03 -- CHANGED THE INITIATOR DISPLAY (XI) TO ALSO DISPLAY THE CLASS
         OF THE JOB CURRENTLY EXECUTING.  ALSO REREADS THE CKPT IF
         THE PIT AND CKPT DO NOT MATCH.
         (INITS)

BFG04 -- IF DISPLAYING THE STATUS OF A "SYSLOG" DATASET, THEN
         DISPLAY THE FIRST TIME STAMP IN IT. (THIS MOD WAS ORIGINALLY
         FROM PWF.)
         (FORMAT)

BFG05 -- ALLOW THE ISSUANCE OF BOTH JES2 COMMANDS AND OS COMMANDS FROM
         AUTHORIZED USERS AT ANY TIME IN THE SESSION.
         (DISPLAY,QCOMMON,AUTH)

BFG06 -- ADD A DISPLAY OF THE CURRENT CPU BUSY PERCENT AND DEMAND
         PAGING RATE TO ALL DISPLAYS IN UPPER RIGHT CORNER OF SCREEN.
         (DISPLAY,QCOMMON)

BFG07 -- ADD A COMMAND TO DISPLAY THE SCREEN OF THE MASTER CONSOLE AND
         ALL CURRENT WQE'S. (THE 'XC' COMMAND.)
         (CONSOLE(NEW),PARSE,HELP,DISPLAY,QSTART)

BFG08 -- ADD COLUMN HEADING FOR DESTINATION OF JOBS OR JOES.
         (FORMAT)

BFG09 -- ORGANIZE KEY 0 SUPPORT BY MOVING ENTRY AND EXIT CODE TO AUTH.
         ADD NEW VARIABLE &QBFG FOR BFG SPECIFIC AUTHORIZATION CODE.
         (QAUTHCK,AUTH,QCOMMON,CONSOLE,SYSOUT,DISPLAY,QSTART)

BFG10 -- CORRECT DJ COMMAND TO ACCEPT JOB NUMBER OR '*' AS DOCUMENTED.
         (SEARCH)

BFG11 -- REINSTALL ORIGINAL FCI MOD TO DA COMMAND TO SHOW JOBS ACTIVE
         ON OUTPUT QUEUE AND INPUT QUEUES (REALLY ON DEVICES).
         (SEARCH,$JQT)

BFG12 -- DISPLAY THE TRANSMISSION AND SYSOUT RECEIVE QUEUES FOR NJE.
         THIS MOD WILL ENCOMPASS THE INITIAL NJE DISPLAY SUPPORT.
         ALSO IMPLEMENT THE 'NJ' COMMAND TO DISPLAY JUST NJE STUFF.
         (SEARCH,$JQT,FORMAT,QCOMMON,INIT,HELP,PARSE)

BFG13 -- ADD NEW INPUT PARM SO THAT THE XI COMMAND FINDS THE CORRECT
         SSVT IF MORE THAN ONE JES IS ACTIVE, ALSO AFFECTS 'DA' AND
         'CAN'/'REQ'/'DEL'.
         ADD COMMAND 'SBSY' TO ALLOW RESET OF SUBSYSTEM ON FLY.
         THE INTENT OF THIS CHANGE IS TO DISALLOW ANY COMMAND THAT MAY
         DEPEND ON THE DATA IN THE SSVT CONTROL BLOCK, IF Q CANNOT
         VERIFY THAT THE SSVT IN QUESTION MATCHES THE CHECKPOINT THAT
         WAS SELECTED.
               THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED BY VALIDATING THE SUBSYSTEM NAME
               AND ASSOCIATED SSVT IN MODULE SUBSYS. THE RESULT IS
               SHOWN BY RETURN CODE. IF VALID, BITS ARE SET ON (IN THE
               AUTHORIZATION AND HELP SECTIONS) TO INDICATE THAT THE
               SSVT ENVIRONMENT IS VALID. IF NOT VALID, THE BITS ARE
               RESET TO INDICATE THE THE SSVT ENVIRONMENT IS NOT VALID.
               COMMANDS THAT ARE SENSITIVE TO THIS ARE: XI, DC, CAN,
               REQ, AND DEL.
         (INIT,INITS,ACTIVE,SYSOUT,QCOMMON,PARSE,HELP,SUBSYS(NEW))

BFG14 -- ADD ADDITIONAL FIELDS TO THE DDNAME DISPLAY:
         FORM, FCB, UCS, COPY
         ADD ADDITIONAL FIELD TO THE PDDB DISPLAY:
         SPIN INDICATOR
         (DDNAME,CPDDB)

BFG15 -- FIX INPUT COMMAND PROCESSING FROM INVOCATION LINE.
         THIS ALLOWS THE INPUT COMMAND TO HAVE PARAMETERS BY
         ENCLOSING THE ENTIRE COMMAND IN QUOTES.
         IF THE DEFAULT COMMAND IS DESIRED, OR IF THE OPTIONAL
         KEYWORD PARMS ARE USED THEN THE FIRST PARM MAY BE AN
         ASTERISK.
         (INIT,ISRQ)

BFG16 -- WITH THE AID OF BFG13 AND BFG05, CHANGE THE COMMAND PROCESSING
         TO ACCEPT COMMANDS THAT START WITH A '.' ALL THE TIME, BUT
         ACCEPT COMMANDS THAT START WITH ANOTHER DELIMITER ONLY WHEN
         WE HAVE VALIDATED THE MATCH BETWEEN A SUBSYSTEM AND THE
         CHECKPOINT, THEN ACCEPT THAT SUBSYSTEM'S COMCHAR AS A DELIM.
         NET EFFECT: IF Q IS SET FOR PRODUCTION CHECKPOINT, THEN
                        PRODUCTION COMCHR IS VALID
                     IF Q IS SET FOR TEST CHECKPOINT, THEN IF CORRECT
                        SUBSYS(.) PARM USED OR CORRECT 'SBSY' COMMAND
                        ISSUED, THEN TEST COMCHR IS VALID
         NOTE: '$' NOLONGER A KEY CHARACTER, EXCEPT THAT IT MAY BE
                  THE CURRENT SUBSYSTEM'S COMCHR
         (SUBSYS,QCOMMON,DISPLAY)

BFG17 -- CHANGE CODE AROUND ONL08 TO USE DIFFERENT SYMBOL AND THE
         'WXTRN' CARD.  THIS WILL PERMIT THE LINK TO SUCCEED AND THE
         ADDRESS WILL BE NON-ZERO ONLY IF Q0 IS INCLUDED BY HAND.
         THIS IS MUCH BETTER AND MORE AUTOMATIC THAN AIF CODING.
         (INIT,Q0)

BFG18 -- CODE CHANGES FOR XA AND ISPF VERSION 2
         (DISPLAY,LISTDS,FORMAT,QCOMMON,INIT)

BFG19 -- ALLOW SYSOUT CLASS TO BE SPECIFIED AS OPTION IN SPIN
         AND FIX BUG WHEN "SPINNING" A JOB LOG
         (CSPIN)

BFG20 -- CHANGE THE 'CAN', 'REQ', AND 'DEL' COMMANDS TO REQURIE
         POSITIVE RESPONSE FOR VALIDATION.  THIS WILL INSURE THAT
         REQUESTS ARE ACKNOWLEDGED, AND ALSO PERMIT USE UNDER ISPF.
         NOTE: ISPF WILL NOT PASS BACK A "NULL" INPUT.
         (SYSOUT, DISPLAY)

BFG21 -- FIX SAME BUG IN "SAVE" AS EXISTED IN "SPIN" CONCERNING A JLOG
         DATASET. ALSO FOR BFG, IF NO PREFIX EXISTS THEN USE THE USER
         ID AS A PREFIX.
         (SAVE)

BFG22 -- CORRECT FORMATING NUMBER OF LINES OF OUTPUT IN THE STATUS
         FORMAT (AND ALL THE COMMANDS THAT USE THE "FORMAT" ROUTINE).
         THIS WILL ALLOW LINE COUNTS GREATER THAN 9,999,999 TO DISPLAY
         IN TERMS OF MILLIONS OF LINES.
         (FORMAT)

BFG23 -- CHANGE INITS SO THAT SYSTEM DOES NOT REQUIRE ASM H TO ASSEMBLE.
         THIS WILL ALLOW USE UNDER 1.3.6.
         (INITS)

BFG24 -- CORRECT LISTDS IN HANDLING A PDDB LRECL OF 0. THIS OCCURS
         ON THE INTERNAL TEXT DATASET (ID=5). FORTUTIOUSLY IT WORKS
         ON THE REGULAR QUEUE BUT FAILED ON ISPF INVOCATIONS
         (LISTDS)

BFG25 -- ADD CODE FROM BILL BALMER TO DISKPAY NUMBER OF LINES LEFT
         TO PRINT FOR ACTIVE JOBS

BFG26 -- CORRECT CLEANUP IN QUEUE FOR MEMORY ALLOCATED IN INIT.
         (INIT,QUEUE,QCOMMON)

BFG27 -- USE IBM PROVIDED INTERFACE TO VERSION 2.3 OF ISPF/PDF.
         THIS SHOULD MAKE QUEUE TRANSPARENT TO THE NEXT RELEASES OF
         ISPF.
         (QCOMMON,INIT,LISTDS,READSPC)

BFG28 -- PERMIT USE OF THE CATALOGED SYS1.HASPCKPT TO ACCESS THE
         PRIMARY JES.  NOTE YOU IMPLEMENT THIS BY SETTING &QCKPTV TO
         SIX BLANKS IN THE MODULE QSTART.
         (INIT)

BFG29 -- FORMAT THE DESTINATION NUMBER CORRECTLY IN THE JHIST COMMAND.
         (CJHIST)

BFG30 -- FORMAT THE JOBNAME, STEPNAME, AND PROC STEPNAME CORRECTLY FOR
         STARTED TASKS AND TSO USERS.
         (ACTIVE)

BFG31 -- SUPPORT MVS/XA 2.2.0 CHANGES THAT AFFECT THE "XC" COMMAND AND
         THE "FTIME" COMMAND.
         (QCOMMON,INIT,CONSOLE,LISTDS)
