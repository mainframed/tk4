Note for TAPESCAN.  01/11/95

   This is just to mention that I've tried to remove an annoying
   aspect of using TAPESCAN, in that footage measures for cartridges
   were being displayed as if they were DEN=2 (800 bpi).  The numbers
   generated were unduly large, and hard to relate to.  I simply made
   an attempt to fool the program into thinking cartridges were DEN=4
   (6250 bpi), which generates footage numbers that are more
   "realistic" to most of us.  I have not attempted to put 38000 bpi
   code into this program.  For me, it's better to relate the numbers
   to "6250 tape" footages.  If you are actually reading a cartridge,
   the word CART appears at end of processing in several places.

   Also included is the previous version of this program in case
   I've inadventently messed something up.

   This program has been linkedited with a routine called "JULIAN"
   that can be found elsewhere on the CBT Tape.  However, I've put
   an object deck and a disassembly for this module here, to make
   your life (hopefully) easier.
