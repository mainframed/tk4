This package contains the Rockwell International developed ISPF Dialog
for processing mail on an MVS/TSO system.  The package was developed
under MVS/XA 2.2.3, TSO/E 2.1 and ISPF 2.3.  The dialog is written
entirely in TSO/E REXX.  This dialog will receive both messages and
files that have been sent to the executing user.  Files will be received
into a unique data set without prompting the user.

The primary dialog elements provided are:

Rexx EXECs:

TMAILLOG      This is the primary exec used to drive the mail LOG
              application dialog.  It displays a menu allowing the user
              to select, review, create and delete log files.

TSOMAILM      This is the primary exec and is the entry point for the
              dialog.  It displays a menu allowing the user to select to
              open and read their mail or to send a note.

TSOMAIL       This is the exec that actually performs the reading of the
              mail and the building/displaying/processing of the mail
              table.

TMAILCPY      This exec is used for copying the files that are received
              when requested to do so by the File Selection option.

TMAILDEF      This exec is used to establish the defaults used by
              the other elements of the dialog.

TMAILEDM      This exec is the ISPF EDIT Macro that establishes the
              environment used for entering the text for messages.

TMAILEDX      This exec is the ISPF EDIT Macro that cleans up the
              message and inserts the sendor information and subject.

TMAILESM      This exec is the ISPF EDIT Macro that builds the SMTP
              message headers.

TMAILEMC      This exec is the ISPF EDIT Macro that processes the
              ISPF EDIT CANCEL command.

TMAILEME      This exec is the ISPF EDIT Macro that processes the
              ISPF EDIT END command.

TMAILEPF      This exec is an ISPF EDIT Macro that builds the PROFS
              header and trailer information to send messages to PROFS.

TMAILPTF      This exec is called by TSOMAIL to un-terse a PTF file
              received via IBM Expedite/Mail.

TMAILSAF      This exec is used for the SAFE MAIL process.

TMAILSND      This exec is used for sending messages and/or messages and
              files.  It is invoked by the TSOMAIL exec for the command
              SENDMAIL and for the Answer and Forwarding functions.

TMAILNIK      This exec is used for the nickname management dialog
              application that is currently being developed.
              ** This is in development and is not complete
              ** but it is usable.

TMIBMFAX      This is an ISPF Edit Macro for when you are in the Transmi
              application that will prompt for the building of the corre
              information to send the note to IBMMAIL.FAX and have it
              then sent as a fax to the specified phone number.


The TSOMAIL exec has a very good prolog with the logic of the dialog
spelled out in it.  You should review it to fully understand what
is happening.

Create MAILCMDS, an ISPF Command Table with the following:

'''' LOG       0  PASSTHRU
                     Log command for TSO/E Mail
'''' RFIND     0  &USRFIND
                     Rfind passthru variable

Updates to ISPCMDS can help ease the use of this dialog.  Sample updates

'''' READMAIL  5  SELECT CMD(%TSOMAIL READ) NEWAPPL(MAIL)
                     DISPLAY TSO/E ISPF MAIL TABLE
'''' RECEIVE   0  SELECT CMD(%TSOMAIL) NEWAPPL(MAIL)
                     SHOW TSO/E INTERACTIVE DATA TRANS MSGS {ALIAS RECV}
'''' RECV      0  SELECT CMD(%TSOMAIL) NEWAPPL(MAIL)
                     SHOW TSO/E INTERACTIVE DATA TRANS MSGS {ALIAS RECEI

                     TRANSMIT A MESSAGE USING TSO/E IDTF (ALIAS XMIT)
