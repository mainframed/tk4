                  IBM Mail Exchange (IMX) Information
                  ===================================

The IBM Mail Exchange (IMX) made a change in their router during July of
1992 that will present problems with the use of this application if you
define the node IBMMAIL as a non-TSO node.

BACKGROUND

IBM Mail Exchange defines nodes by the type of mail application used on
that node.  If you are planning to use this application then you are
probably defined to IMX as a TSO node.  The only message types supported
from your node into IMX are TSO format (Interactive Data Transmission
Facility aka IDTF or NETDATA) messages.

PROBLEM

If node IBMMAIL is defined as a non-TSO node then this application will
send the messages in PROFS format which IMX will reject.

SOLUTION

Have your node defined to IMX as a type OEM node with PROFS and NETDATA
message support.  This will solve the problem.

CAVEAT

Acknowledgements that are now returned to your node from PROFS and OV/VM
systems will now be received by this dialog using the TSO RECEIVE
command as an Invalid File Type because of a 'bug' in the RECEIVE
command.  This problem is caused by the acknowledgements having a
trailer record that is valid for PROFS and OV/VM but is considered
invalid by TSO RECEIVE.  An APAR has been attempted with no success so
far (perhaps if everyone opened a problem with IBM on this they might
listen better).
