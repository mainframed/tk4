This data set is in IEBUPDTE format and must be loaded into a
partitioned data set (recfm=FB,lrecl=80,blksize=80*n).  Each member is
an IEBUPDTE stream with the './' changed to '+/' for purposes of this
unload and transfer.

********************************Important*******************************
*  If you received this file via the Internet (or one of its

This data set contains an ISPF dialog that was developed using TSO/E 2.1
and ISPF 3.2 to process mail and files sent to and from TSO using the
IBM provided TSO TRANSMIT and RECEIVE commands.

A new addition is an ISPF Command Table for use with the dialog to suppo
the use of the LOG command to enter the mail log dialog.  This must be
created using the following steps:

    1.  Enter ISPF 3.9 (Commands)
    2.  Specify MAIL for the application id
    3.  Specify a verb of LOG
                  t of 0
                  action of PASSTHRU
                  description of - LOG command for TSO/E-Mail Dialog
    4.  PF3 to save

Also included as part of this package is a TSO/E SAFE Mail application
that will receive mail messages and mail files for user's who are out
of the office and thus unable to RECEIVE their mail before the JES SPOOL
is purged of aged data.

Caveats:  Use this at your own risk and only after you have reviewed
every line of Rexx code to insure that you understand it and that there
is nothing that might be contrary to your installation standards or
practices.  I have tried to remove or document all of the installation
dependencies that I could find or think of, but I may have missed a
few - please let me know of any that need to be fixed or documented.

If you find a problem, please let me know.  I may or may not be able to
fix it depending upon your and my operating environment, but I will try.
Also, if you have any extensions, fixes, etc. for this dialog please let
me know.

All comments, suggestions, extensions/enhancements should be sent to:

This data set contains the following members:

$README  -  What you are currently reading...
CHANGES  -  Short list of changes to the dialog
DOCUMENT -  Brief Documentation on this dialog.
ASM      -  The source for the SHOW and SHOWTSO modules and HELP
            and samples for IMNXZ02 (for JES2 and JES3)
            Also the TMAILQRY source is included here.
EXEC     -  Set of REXX EXECs that are the driving force behind this
            dialog.
IBMMAIL  -  IMPORTANT information if using this with IBMMAIL addresses
MACROS   -  Assembler macros needed for the ASM members
MSGS     -  The ISPF Message for the dialog.
OTHER    -  Contains a dummy exec for RMBFMAIL (that I can't ship)
PANELS   -  The ISPF Panels used by the dialog.
PROCLIB  -  The started task JCL for SYS1.PROCLIB member SAFEMAIL.
SAFECDS  -  Sample primer for the SAFEMAIL.CDS data set
            (copy this member into the data set that you
             allocate for the Safe mail control data set).

The dialog now uses a new TSO command, TMAILQRY, that checks to
determine if there is mail to receive.  This command must be authorized
and thus must be included in your SYS1.PARMLIB list of authorized
TSO commands.  If you have ACF2 then it must also be included in your
command limiting table.

JES3 users should code IATUX42 to generate a message to TSO users when
mail is received from another node.

JES2 users should code Exit 13 to generate a message to TSO users when
mail is received from another node.

Special note about sending messages from TSO to PROFS.  The dialog now
supports the sending of messages from TSO to PROFS in the PROFS format.
This means that the PROFS user will see the messages in their mail menu
correctly with a valid subject.  There currently exists a problem when
acknowledgements are requested for these types of messages in that the
acknowledgement is returned to the MVS system in a form that cannot be
processed by the TSO RECEIVE command.  I have no circumvention for this
at this time and IBM does not recognize this as a problem.

SAFEMAIL is a very helpful and unique capability that is designed to be
a started task that wakes up every 24 hours or is started by some
automation or job scheduling system once a day and it will read a users
mail and save it for them while they are on vacation or out of the
office for whatever reason.  This is to prevent their mail from being
purged from the JES spool because of age.

SAFEMAIL requires TSO OPER authority as it performs a RECEIVE on behalf
of other users and the RECEIVE command enforces this.  SAFEMAIL should
also be given the ability to allocate data sets under any high level
index as the RECEIVE command will generate data sets for those users
who request it and you will not want to have SAFEMAIL abending because
of security.

Note:  There exist within this dialog a number of Rockwell dependencies
that you will have to address before you can completely install and
utilize this dialog.  These dependencies are:

Asm:     SHOW and SHOWTSO
         These are the sub-routine and the TSO command that we use to
         extract information from various system control blocks and
         from ACF2.  You should look VERY closely at the SHOW subroutine
         to remove anything that is local to Rockwell or does not apply
         to your environment.  The full SHOW package is now included
         as of 4/28/92 and includes a CLIST and REXX function as well
         as a SHOWSPF module - sample link jcl is also included.

Panels:  TMAILMNU
         This menu panel calls the TMAILDEF exec to establish a set of
         defaults for use by the other parts of the dialog.

Execs:   TMAILDEF
         This exec uses the Rockwell TSO Command SHOWTSO to extract
         basic information that is used by other elements of the ISPF
         dialog.  You can/should replace the use of SHOWTSO with your
         own default specification.  Or you can remove the use of
         SHOWTSO here as this exec displays an ISPF Panel for the
         defaults and requires that they be filled in.

         TMAILSAF
         This exec is used for the TSO Safe Mail process and uses the
         SHOWTSO command to extract the center name.  Based upon center
         it sets a high-level index that is used for the control data
         set name and the log data set (this log is only used when the
         RECEIVE command is issued for SAFEMAIL userid processing).

         TMAILSM
         This exec allocates a temporary file used for the message text
         that is sent to the SAFEMAIL application to register or
         un-register for safe mail processing.  The unit value is
         SYSVIO.  This exec also used the SHOWTSO command to extract
         the current home node (center).

         TMAILPTF
         This exec will unterse IBM PTF files received via Expedite/Mail
         (ordered via IBMLINK).  The load library that contains the
         unterse load module must be updated to reflect your library.

         TMAILSND
         This exec allocates a temporary file used for entering the text
         of messages to a unit of SYSVIO.  If you have SYSVIO defined
         for VIO then you do not have to change this exec, otherwise
         SYSVIO must be changed to either real disk or your VIO
         esoteric.

         You will also need to update the SMTP information variables
         if you wish to send mail via SMTP (e.g. Internet, Bitnet).

         This exec also contains a list of node names that are used to
         determine if the node is TSO or non-TSO.  You will need to
         update this list of node names.

         TMIBMFAX

         This exec is an ISPF Edit Macro that will build the appropriate
         header information for sending a note to the IBMMail FAX
         service for delivery via a fax machine.  It is invoked by
         entering FAXIBM on the ISPF Command Line while in the note
         creation Edit panel.

         TSOMAIL
         This exec uses the Rockwell TSO Command SHOWTSO to extract the
         current NJE Node Name.  You should replace this with your own
         command/clist/exec or hard code the node name in the exec.
         This exec also defaults the name of the users TSO mail log data
         set to userid.LOG.MISC.  If this is not your default (look at
         your INMXPARM assembly) then you must change this exec.  This
         exec also uses the PDS TSO command when the current mail table
         data set is full and must be reallocated and copied.  If you do
         not have the PDS command (it's free from various MVS tools
         tapes) then you should change the copy to use IEBCOPY or some
         other copy command.  Another dependency is the use of the
         Rockwell %RPRINT clist which invokes a Rockwell dialog of
         various print drivers for different vendors printers.  This
         dialog is not provided with this data set as you can probably
         do it better.
