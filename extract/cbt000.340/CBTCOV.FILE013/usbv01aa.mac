THE PROGRAM X001310 (USBV01A) PROCESSES THE PTF TAPE PROVIDED BY IBM.
THE USER SPECIFIES THE APPLICABLE RELEASE ON THE EXEC PARAMETER.
FOR EVERY PTF THE PREREQUISITE AND SUPERSEDED PTF'S AND THE APARS
FIXED ARE DISPLAYED, IF THEY BELONG TO THE APPLICABLE RELEASE
ALL OTHER PTF'S ARE MARKED AS 'WRONG RELEASE'.
ALL DATA PERTAINING TO A PTF ARE COMPARED WITH THE PRESENT SYSTEM
STATUS (LIST PTF.), YIELDING THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION ---
     - PTF 'ALREADY IN',
     - MISSING PREREQUISITE PTF'S

   THE PTF TO BE ANALYZED, WILL CHANGE MODULES OF ANY KIND (++MOD-,
   ++ZAP-, ++MAC-, ++UPDTE-STATEMENTS). EACH OF THESE MODULES WILL
   BE CHECKED FOR PTF'S THEY ALREADY CONTAIN. THESE PTF'S ARE
   COMPARED WITH THE PREREQUISITES, SUPERCEDES AND APARS FIXED.
   THE FOLLOWING PROBLEMS MAY ARISE ---
     - LZNNNNN (IBM LOCAL FIXES) AND BZNNNNN (USER LOCAL FIXES)
       ARE ALWAYS CONSIDERED AS PROBLEMS.
     - AZNNNNN (SUPERZAP PTF'S) MUST BE MENTIONED EITHER IN THE
       SUPERCEDED PTF'S, OR THE NUMBER MUST MATCH ONE OF THE
       APARS FIXED.
     - UZNNNNN (MODULE REPLACEMENTS) MUST BE MENTIONED EITHER
       AMONG THE PREREQUISITES OR THE SUPERCEDES.
     - OLD PTF'S MUST BE EITHER ACCEPTED OR RESTORED BEFORE APPLYING
       THE NEW PTF.
