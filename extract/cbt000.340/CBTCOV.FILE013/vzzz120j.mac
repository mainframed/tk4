)F FUNCTION -
 THE PDS COMMAND ALLOWS A TSO USER TO ACCESS AND MANIPULATE THE
 DIRECTORY AND SELECTED MEMBERS OF A PARTITIONED DATA SET (PDS).
                                                                       .
 WITH ITS DIRECTORY OPTIONS, THE PDS COMMAND CAN PRODUCE STATISTICS
 ON DIRECTORY AND DATA SET USAGE, DISPLAY PORTIONS OF THE DIRECTORY,
 AND DELETE, RENAME OR CREATE ALIASES FOR SELECTED MEMBERS.
                                                                       .
 FOR LOAD DATA SETS, OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO LIST LOAD MODULE HISTORY
 DATA, DISPLAY AND MODIFY LOAD MODULE LINKAGE ATTRIBUTES, AND PRODUCE
 LOAD MODULE CSECT MAPS IN TWO DIFFERENT LENGTHS.
                                                                       .
 FOR OTHER PARTITIONED DATA SETS, OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE TO SUBMIT A
 MEMBER (JCL) FOR BACKGROUND PROCESSING, LIST A MEMBER, EDIT A MEMBER,
 LIST LINES FROM A MEMBER CONTAINING A SPECIFIED SEARCH STRING OR
 RESTORE A PREVIOUSLY DELETED MEMBER AS AN ALIAS AT A SPECIFIED TTR.
                                                                       .

 PDS COMMAND FEATURES:
    HEXADECIMAL MEMBER NAMES -- MEMBER NAMES MAY BE ENTERED IN HEX FOR
    ANY OF THE SUBCOMMANDS WHICH ACCEPT MEMBER NAMES (OR PARTIAL MEMBER
    NAMES) AS INPUT.  THUS, FOR SUBCOMMANDS ALIAS, ATTR, DISPLAY,
    DELETE, EDIT, FIND, HISTORY, LIST, MAP, PATTERN, RENAME, RESTORE,
    SMAP OR SUBMIT X'D7C4E2F9' AND PDS9 ARE EQUIVALENT.  ALSO, NOTE
    THAT X'333' AND X'0333' ARE EQUIVALENT.

    DEFAULT MEMBER NAMES -- IF NO MEMBER NAME IS ENTERED FOR AN ATTR,
    EDIT, FIND, HISTORY, LIST, MAP, SMAP OR SUBMIT SUBCOMMAND, THE PDS
    COMMAND WILL USE THE LAST MEMBER NAME ENTERED WITH ANY OF THE ABOVE
    SUBCOMMANDS.
                                                                       .
    SUBCOMMAND ABBREVIATIONS -- ALL SUBCOMMAND NAMES CAN BE ABBREVIATED
    TO THE FIRST FEW CHARACTERS OF THE SUBCOMMAND NAME; ALL SUBCOMMAND
    NAMES EXCEPT ALIAS, DELETE, END, EXEC, HISTORY, RESTORE AND SUBMIT
    MAY BE ABBREVIATED TO THE FIRST CHARACTER OF THE SUBCOMMAND NAME.
    IN PARTICULAR, NOTE THE FOLLOWING:
      AN A SUBCOMMAND IS EQUIVALENT TO AN ATTR SUBCOMMAND
      A D SUBCOMMAND IS EQUIVALENT TO A DISPLAY SUBCOMMAND
      AN E SUBCOMMAND IS EQUIVALENT TO AN EDIT SUBCOMMAND
      AN H SUBCOMMAND IS EQUIVALENT TO A HELP SUBCOMMAND
      AN R SUBCOMMAND IS EQUIVALENT TO A RENAME SUBCOMMAND
      A S SUBCOMMAND IS EQUIVALENT TO A SMAP SUBCOMMAND
