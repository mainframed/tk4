* THIS MODIFICATION SETS THE CURRENT DATE IN THE EXPDT-FIELD OF
* THE FORMAT 1 DSCB. THAT IS DONE, WHENEVER THE DATASET IS OPENED.
* THEREFORE IT IS POSSIBLE TO SEE, WHEN A DATASET WAS USED LAST.
*
* WE ARE USING THE EXPDT FIELD, BECAUSE IT IS NORMALLY NOT USED
* FOR OTHER THINGS IN OUR INSTALLATION. IT ENABLES US, TO SCRATCH,
* FOR EXAMPLE, ALL DATA SETS ON A DISK NOT USED DURING THE LAST
* THREE MONTH.
*
* IT SHOULD BE EASY TO CHANGE THIS MODIFICATION IN A WAY, THAT ANY
* OTHER FIELD IN THE DSCB CAN USED TO HOLD THIS INFORMATION.
