*     UTITLITY LNUNITS (LINIE UNIT TRACE)
*
*
* THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN DEVELOPED UNDER OS/MVT AS A TOOL TO
* SPECIFY THE LNUNITS PARAMETER IN A TCAM MCP.
*
* IT RUNS IN ITS OWN REGION AND CHECKS IN REGULAR INTERVALS,
* HOW MANY LNUNITS ARE ACTUALLY USED. A WARNING IS WRITTEN TO
* THE CONSOLE, IF THE NUMBER OF FREE LNUNITS GOES BELOW 20% AND
* 10% OF THE TOTAL LNUNITS.
*
* THE OUTPUT LIST SHOWS, HOW MANY LNUNITS WHERE FREE/USED AT A
* CERTAIN MOMENT. IN ADDITION THE NUMBER OF MESSAGES WAITING FOR
* SPECIAL APPLICATION QUEUES IN THIS INTERVALL IS PRINTED.
* THIS LAST PART HAS TO BE MODIFIED FOR YOUR OWN INSTALLATION.
*
* AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PROGRAM THE MACRO 'COMEIN' IS USED,
* TO SET UP BASE REGISTER ETC.
*
* BECAUSE SIMILAR MACROS ARE USED IN MOST INSTALLATIONS, THIS
* STATEMENT HAS TO BE CHANGED ACORDING TO YOUR OWN STANDARDS.
*
* A NEW VERSION OF THIS PROGRAM FOR MVS, USING SRB-SCHEDULING
* SHOULD BE AVAILABLE BY AUGUST 1977.
