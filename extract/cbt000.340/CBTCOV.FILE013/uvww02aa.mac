      THIS IS A DESCRIPTION OF VW SPECIAL SEQUENTIAL RANDOMIZER
*
      CAN BE USED IF KEY FORMAT IS PREFIX-METRIC
          WHERE
             PREFIX IS 0-4 CHAR
             METRIC IS 1-8 NUMERIC
*
*
      IT CONSISTS OF TWO CSECTS
          HDAMSEQ   -   REENTRANT CODE
          TABS      -   ASSEMBLED OUTPUT OF UVWW03 (KEY-ANALYZER)
*
      TABS-CSECT CONSISTS OF
        - DOCUMENTATION FIELDS PRECEDED BY A LENGTH FIELD,NOT USED
          BY HDAMSEQ,WHICH SIMPLY STEPS OVER THESE FIELDS
        - PREFIX BLOCKS
        - DATA BLOCKS
*
      OTHER DATA AVAILABLE TO HDAMSEQ
        - NUMBER BLKS AND RAPS,PASSED OVER BY IMS FROM VALUES IN DBD
        - KEY
        - KEY LENGTH,PASSED OVER FROM IMS BUT NOT USED AS ALL LENGTH
          DATA IS TAKEN FROM TABS
*
      SPECIAL VW-CONVENTIONS INCLUDED
        - NUMBER OF BLKS IN RAA TESTED FOR ODD OR EVEN
            -ODD       ALL GROUPS OF KEYS ALLOWED
            -EVEN      ONLY KEYS WITH THE SAME CHARACTER IN POSITION 1
                       ALLOWED
            THIS ALLOWS USING THE SAME RANDOMIZER FOR DIFFERENT DB'S
            WHERE ONE DB CONTAINS ALL KEYS AND OTHER DB'S CONTAIN ONLY A
            SUBSET OF KEYS AND EACH SUBSET IS IDENTIFIED BY POS 1 OF KEY
        - THE NUMERIC PART OF KEY IS TESTED,IF IT IS NOT NUMERIC ,IT
          WILL BE SET TO ZERO (NO 0C7 IN IMS-CONTROL REGION)

*
      LOGIC                            PI = EXECUTABLE PREFIX LENGTH
      STEP SEQUENTIALLY THROUGH PREFIX BLOCKS AND USE THE PI VALUE TO
      COMPARE THE FIRST PI + 1 BYTES OF KEY TO PREFIXES AND TABLES.
      CONTINUE TILL PREFIX GE KEY IS FOUND
      CONVERT METRIC PART TO BINARY
      LOCATE DATA BLOCK
      COMPUTE  I-VALUE
      COMPUTE  BLK/RAP AND GIVE IT TO IMS  (LIKE DFSHDC40)
