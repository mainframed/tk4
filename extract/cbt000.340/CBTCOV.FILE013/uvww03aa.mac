      THIS IS A DESCRIPTION OF THE KEY-ANALYZER AND TABLE CREATER
      USED FOR THE VW SPECIAL SEQUENTIAL RANDOMIZER
*
      CAN BE USED IF KEY FORMAT IS PREFIX-METRIC
          WHERE
             PREFIX IS 0-4 CHAR
             METRIC IS 1-8 NUMERIC
      MORE INFORMATION IN SOURCE CODE UVWW02AS AND UVWW03AS ,
      AND DESCRIPTION UVWW02AA
*
      INSTALLATION-JCL TO CREATE THE SEQUENTIAL RANDOMIZER SEE UVWW02AJ
*
      INPUT
           - FILE WITH ACTUAL KEYS
           - FUTURE KEYS
               - IN THE SOURCE CODE,NUMBER EXPECTED KEYS PER MONTH
                 AT THE END OF EVERY PREFIX GROUP
               - OR A FILE OF FUTURE KEYS MERGED WITH THE ACTUAL
      OUTPUT
           - TABLE FOR THE VW SPECIAL RANDOMIZER
           - JUMP STATISTIC
*
      LOGIC OF THE ANALYZER
        READS A FILE OF KEYS.THE KEYS CONSIST OF A PREFIX FOLLOWED BY A
        METRIC PART.THE LENGTH OF PREFIX AND METRIC CAN CHANGE PER
        DIFFERENT PREFIX VALUES.
        FOR GIVEN PREFIX VALUE PI LET
          RI = NUMBER KEYS WITH THIS PREFIX
          PI = PREFIX LENGTH - 1(EXECUTABLE LENGTH
          MI = METRIC LENGTH - 1
          GI = EXPECTED NUMBER OF NEW KEYS PER MONTH THAT WILL BE
               INSERTED,WITH INCREMENT=1,AFTER THE HIGHEST KEY
               UNDER THE GIVEN PREFIX
        THE ANALYZER CREATES TWO TYPES OF BLOCKS
          - PREFIX BLOCKS,ONE PER EVERY SEPARATELY DESCRIBED PREFIX
            VALUE,PLUS A SPECIAL FIRST AND A DUMMY LAST BLOCK
            THESE BLOCKS ARE ACTUALLY SOURCE-CODED AND MODIFIED DURING
            KEY ANALYSIS
          - DATA BLOCKS,A MINIMUM OF THREE FOR EVERY NORMAL PREFIX BLOCK
              - FIRST WITH DUMMY LOW KEY
              - ONE FOR EVERY MAJOR JUMP IN KEY VALUE
              - A SPECIAL GROWTH BLOCK IF GI NE 0
              - A LAST BLOCK WITH DUMMY HIGH KEY
        ALL VALUES IN ALL BLOCKS,EXCEPT FOR PREFIX ID,ARE IN BINARY
        THE FIELDS MAY BE 1,2 3 OR 4 POSITIONS OF BINARY

 0-3  GI                        NI=RI+(GI*&MTHS) &MTHS IS GLOBAL SETA
 4    LENGTH OF A PREFIX BLOCK  SAME
 5    PI                        SAME
 6    LENGTH OF DATA BLOCKS     SAME
 7    MI                        SAME
 8-9                            OFFSET TO FIRST DATA BLOCK FOR THIS
                                PREFIX
 10-11                          2**N,WHERE N IS SMALLEST INTEGER FOR
                                WHICH 2**N GE NUMBER DATA BLOCKS FOR
                                THIS PREFIX
 12-  PREFIX                    SAME
*
 CURRENTLY ALL PREFIX BLOCKS ARE 16 BYTES LONG,THUS ALLOWING A MAXIMUM
 PREFIX LENGTH OF 4 BYTES AND MAKING POSITION 4 EQ HEX 10 IN ALL BLOCKS
*
 ALSO ALL DATA BLOCKS ARE CURRENTLY 8 BYTES LONG SO THAT POS 6 IS HEX 8
*
 FOR VW ALL KEYS ARE 8 BYTES BECAUSE PI + MI = 6 ,FOR ALL I
*
*
*
*                        DATA BLOCKS
 THESE DESCRIBE A GROUP OF KEYS WITH THE SAME PREFIX.THE PROPERTIES ARE
 BASED ON THE METRIC PART WHICH IS CONVERTED TO BIMARY
*
 0-1  MEAN INTER KEY DISTANCE/16
 2-4  NUMBER KEYS WITH SAME PREFIX BUT WITH METRIC VALUE < X
 5-7  X
