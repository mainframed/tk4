./ ADD  NAME=PDS
)F FUNCTION -
 THE PDS COMMAND ALLOWS A TSO USER TO ACCESS AND MANIPULATE THE
 DIRECTORY AND SELECTED MEMBERS OF A PARTITIONED DATA SET (PDS).
                                                                       .
 PDS SUBCOMMANDS ARE AVAILABLE TO DISPLAY STATISTICS ON THE DATA SET
 DIRECTORY AND DATA SET USAGE, DISPLAY PORTIONS OF THE MEMBER NAME
 DIRECTORY, LIST OCCURANCES OF A SEARCH STRING IN A MEMBER, RESTORE A
 PREVIOUSLY DELETED MEMBER, CREATE AN ALIAS FOR A MEMBER, DISPLAY ALL
 ALIASES FOR A MEMBER, AND LIST, DELETE OR RENAME A MEMBER.
                                                                       .
 FOR LOAD DATA SETS, SUBCOMMANDS ARE AVAILABLE TO DISPLAY AND MODIFY
 THE LINKAGE ATTRIBUTES OF A MODULE, LIST THE HISTORY DATA FOR A
 MODULE AND MAP THE CSECT STRUCTURE OF A MODULE.
                                                                       .
 FOR OTHER PARTITIONED DATA SETS, SUBCOMMANDS ARE AVAILABLE TO SUBMIT
 A JCL MEMBER, EDIT A MEMBER, PRINT A MEMBER AND DISPLAY SPF STATISTICS
 FOR A MEMBER.
                                                                       .

 PDS COMMAND FEATURES:
    HEXADECIMAL MEMBER NAMES -- MEMBER NAMES MAY BE ENTERED IN HEX FOR
    ANY OF THE SUBCOMMANDS WHICH ACCEPT MEMBER NAMES (OR PARTIAL MEMBER
    NAMES) AS INPUT.  THUS, FOR THESE SUBCOMMANDS, X'D7C4E2F9' AND PDS9
    ARE EQUIVALENT.  ALSO, NOTE THAT X'333' AND X'0333' ARE EQUIVALENT.
                                                                       .
    DEFAULT MEMBER NAMES -- IF NO MEMBER NAME IS ENTERED FOR AN
    ATTRIB, DELETE, DIRENTRY, EDIT, FIND, HISTORY, LIST,
    MAP, MEMBERS, PRINTOFF, SMAP, OR SUBMIT
    SUBCOMMAND, THE PDS COMMAND WILL USE THE LAST MEMBER NAME OR
    MEMBER GROUP ENTERED FOR ANY OF THESE SUBCOMMANDS; ALSO, NOTE
    THAT ALIAS, RENAME AND RESTORE SUBCOMMANDS ALSO MODIFY THE
    DEFAULT MEMBER NAME.
                                                                       .
    MEMBER GROUPS -- THE ABOVE SUBCOMMANDS WHICH ALLOW DEFAULT MEMBER
    NAMES ALSO ACCEPT RANGES AND PATTERNS OF MEMBER NAMES.  A MEMBER
    NAME RANGE IS SPECIFIED AS NAME1:NAME2, WHICH SELECTS THE SAME
    MEMBERS AS DISPLAY NAME1 NAME2; A PATTERN MEMBER NAME IS
    SPECIFIED AS NAME1/NAME2, WHICH SELECTS THE SAME MEMBERS AS
    PATTERN NAME1 NAME2.
                                                                       .
    SUBCOMMAND NAME ABBREVIATIONS -- ALL SUBCOMMAND NAMES CAN BE
    ABBREVIATED TO THE FIRST FEW CHARACTERS OF THE SUBCOMMAND NAME.
    SUBCOMMAND NAMES ARE SCANNED IN THE ORDER OF OUTPUT FROM THE
    OPTIONS SUBCOMMAND; THE FIRST MATCH BETWEEN THE ENTERED NAME
    AND THE SUBCOMMAND NAME TABLE IS USED.
                                                                       .
    UPDATE LOCK -- THE PDS COMMAND ALLOCATES DATA SETS WITH DISP=SHR
    BY DEFAULT.  IF AN ATTRIB (WITH CHANGED ATTRIBUTES), ALIAS,
    DELETE, RENAME OR RESTORE SUBCOMMAND IS ISSUED FOR A DATA SET
    ALLOCATED WITH DISP=SHR, THE PDS COMMAND CLOSES THE DATA SET AND
    ATTEMPTS TO REALLOCATE THE DATA SET WITH DISP=OLD.  THIS PREVENTS
    SIMULTANEOUS UPDATES OF THE PARTITIONED DATA SET DIRECTORY; FOR
    MORE INFORMATION, SEE HELP UPDATE.

=ATTN=PA1=ATTE=ATTEN=ATTENT=ATTENTI=ATTENTIO
)F  THE ATTN HELP ENTRY IS PROVIDED TO EXPLAIN THE ATTENTION PROCESSING
 PERFORMED BY PDS.  NOTE THAT IN GENERAL, AN ATTENTION (THE PA1 KEY)
 MAY BE USED TO TERMINATE THE CURRENT PDS SUBCOMMAND AND TWO ATTENTIONS
 IN A ROW MAY BE USED TO TERMINATE THE PDS COMMAND.
                                                                       .
 THE SPECIFIC PDS ATTENTION PROCESSING PERFORMED FOR A SUBCOMMAND
 DEPENDS ON IF THE SUBCOMMAND IS INTERNAL OR EXTERNAL TO THE PDS
 COMMAND.  THE EXTERNAL SUBCOMMANDS INCLUDE BROWSE, EDIT, EXEC, HELP,
 PRINTOFF, SPFEDIT, SUBMIT AND TSOLIST; THE OTHER PDS SUBCOMMANDS ARE
 INTERNAL TO THE PDS COMMAND.
                                                                       .

 IN THE FOLLOWING, THE ATTENTION PROCESSING PROVIDED BY PDS IS
 DESCRIBED IN MORE DETAIL:
                                                                       .
  1.  AN ATTENTION SHOULD TERMINATE ANY MEMBER GROUP IN PROGRESS
      (EXCEPT FOR THE EDIT SUBCOMMAND).
                                                                       .
  2.  AN ATTENTION AT A PROMPT FOR A DATA SET SHOULD TERMINATE PDS
      IMMEDIATELY.
                                                                       .
  3.  AN ATTENTION AT "ENTER OPTION", SHOULD PROVIDE AN "ENTER OPTION"
      PROMPT; ANOTHER ATTENTION AT THIS POINT SHOULD TERMINATE PDS.
                                                                       .
  4.  FOR INTERNAL PDS SUBCOMMANDS, AN ATTENTION SHOULD RESULT IN AN
      "ENTER OPTION" PROMPT; THE PROCESSING ACTION TAKEN AT THIS POINT
      DEPENDS ON THE DATA ENTERED NEXT:
      A.  ANOTHER ATTENTION SHOULD TERMINATE THE PDS COMMAND.
      B.  A SUBCOMMAND SHOULD BE HONORED BY PDS IMMEDIATELY.
      C.  A NULL LINE SHOULD CAUSE THE INTERRUPTED SUBCOMMAND TO
          CONTINUE AT THE POINT OF INTERRUPTION.  NOTE: ANY MESSAGES
          AWAITING OUTPUT AT THE TIME OF THE INTERRUPT WILL BE LOST.
                                                                       .
  5.  FOR EXTERNAL PDS SUBCOMMANDS, NO "ENTER OPTION" PROMPT FROM PDS
      SHOULD APPEAR IN RESPONSE TO AN ATTENTION INTERRUPT:
      A.  THE FIRST ATTENTION IN THESE SUBCOMMANDS (EXCEPT FOR EDIT)
          SHOULD TERMINATE ANY MEMBER GROUP IN PROGRESS.
      B.  THE SECOND ATTENTION IN THESE SUBCOMMANDS (EXCEPT FOR BROWSE
          AND SPFEDIT) SHOULD TERMINATE PDS AND THE SUBCOMMAND.  NOTE
          THAT THE SECOND ATTENTION NEED NOT IMMEDIATELY FOLLOW THE
          FIRST ATTENTION TO TERMINATE PDS AND THE SUBCOMMAND.

=GROUPS=G=GR=GRO=GROU=GROUP=GROUP.
)F  THE GROUP HELP ENTRY IS PROVIDED TO EXPLAIN THE VARIOUS MEMBER
 NAME FORMS ALLOWED.  MEMBER NAMES MAY BE ENTERED IN EITHER CHARACTER
 OR HEXADECIMAL MODE FOR ANY SUBCOMMAND WHICH PROCESSES MEMBER NAMES.
                                                                       .

 SUBCOMMANDS ATTRIB, BROWSE, DELETE, DIRENTRY, EDIT, FIND, HISTORY,
 LIST, MAP, MEMBERS, PRINTOFF, SMAP, SPFEDIT, SUBMIT AND TSOLIST ALLOW
 ADDITIONAL MEMBER NAME SPECIFICATIONS.  A MEMBER NAME RANGE OR MEMBER
 NAME PATTERN SPECIFIES WHAT IS CALLED A MEMBER GROUP.
                                                                       .
 WHEN A MEMBER GROUP IS BEING PROCESSED, THE SUBCOMMAND PROCESSING
 ROUTINE IS RE-EXECUTED FOR EACH MEMBER IN THE GROUP.  SPECIFICALLY,
 NOTE THE FOLLOWING:
                                                                       .
  1.  DEFAULT MEMBER NAME -- IF NO MEMBER NAME IS SPECIFIED, THE
      LAST MEMBER NAME OR MEMBER GROUP ENTERED FOR ANY OF THE ABOVE
      SUBCOMMANDS WILL BE ASSUMED.
                                                                       .
  2.  ASTERISK MEMBER NAME -- IF * IS ENTERED IN THE MEMBER NAME
      POSITION, THE LAST MEMBER NAME OR MEMBER GROUP ENTERED FOR
      ANY OF THE ABOVE SUBCOMMANDS WILL BE ASSUMED.
                                                                       .
  3.  MEMBER NAME RANGE -- ANY OF THESE SUBCOMMANDS MAY PROCESS ALL
      MEMBERS IN A RANGE BY SPECIFYING A BEGINNING PARTIAL MEMBER
      NAME, A COLON, AND A ENDING PARTIAL MEMBER NAME (EITHER OR
      BOTH OF THE PARTIAL NAMES MAY BE NULL).
                                                                       .
      LOGIC FROM THE DISPLAY SUBCOMMAND IS USED TO SELECT MEMBERS;
      THE SUBCOMMAND PROCESSES THESE SELECTED MEMBERS IN ALPHABETIC
      ORDER.  THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATIONS WOULD PROCESS THE SAME
      MEMBER NAMES:
            SUBCOMMAND  :              AND    DISPLAY
            SUBCOMMAND  PART1:         AND    DISPLAY  PART1
            SUBCOMMAND  :PART2         AND    DISPLAY  X'00' PART2
            SUBCOMMAND  PART1:PART2    AND    DISPLAY  PART1 PART2
                                                                       .
  4.  MEMBER NAME PATTERN -- ANY OF THESE SUBCOMMANDS MAY PROCESS ALL
      MEMBERS WHOSE NAMES CONTAIN PATTERN CHARACTERS BY SPECIFYING A
      MEMBER NAME SEGMENT, A SLASH, AND ANOTHER MEMBER NAME SEGMENT
      (EITHER, NOT BOTH, OF THE MEMBER NAME SEGMENTS MAY BE NULL).
                                                                       .
      LOGIC FROM THE PATTERN SUBCOMMAND IS USED TO SELECT MEMBERS;
      THE SUBCOMMAND PROCESSES THESE SELECTED MEMBERS IN ALPHABETIC
      ORDER.  THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATIONS WOULD PROCESS THE SAME
      MEMBER NAMES:
            SUBCOMMAND  SEG1/          AND    PATTERN  SEG1
            SUBCOMMAND  /SEG2          AND    PATTERN  SEG2
            SUBCOMMAND  SEG1/SEG2      AND    PATTERN  SEG1 SEG2

=UPDATE=UP=UPD=UPDA=UPDAT
)F  THE UPDATE HELP ENTRY IS PROVIDED TO EXPLAIN THE UPDATE LOCKING
 STRUCTURE IMPLEMENTED FOR CERTAIN PDS SUBCOMMANDS.
                                                                       .
 THE PDS COMMAND ALLOCATES DATA SETS WITH DISP=SHR BY DEFAULT.  IF
 AN ATTRIB (WITH ATTRIBUTES TO BE CHANGED), ALIAS, DELETE, RENAME OR
 RESTORE SUBCOMMAND IS ISSUED FOR A DATA SET ALLOCATED WITH DISP=SHR,
 THE PDS COMMAND CLOSES THE DATA SET AND ATTEMPTS TO REALLOCATE THE
 DATA SET WITH DISP=OLD.
                                                                       .
   1.  IF REALLOCATION IS SUCCESSFUL, DISP=OLD ALLOCATION OF THE
       DATA SET IS MAINTAINED UNTIL THE PDS COMMAND FREES THE DATA
       SET (WHEN A CHANGE OR END SUBCOMMAND IS ENTERED).  THIS
       UPDATE LOCK PREVENTS ANY OTHER SIMULTANEOUS USE OF THE DATA
       SET AND INSURES THAT TWO OR MORE USERS CANNOT UPDATE A
       PARTITIONED DATA SET DIRECTORY AT THE SAME TIME.
                                                                       .
   2.  IF REALLOCATION FAILS BECAUSE ANOTHER USER IS ALLOCATED TO THE
       DATA SET OR BECAUSE OF A SECURITY PACKAGE SUCH AS PCF II, THE
       ACCESS IS DENIED; AN ERROR MESSAGE IS DISPLAYED; DISP=SHR
       ALLOCATION IS AGAIN OBTAINED; AND THE SUBCOMMAND (ALIAS, ATTR,
       DELETE, RENAME OR RESTORE) IS IGNORED.
