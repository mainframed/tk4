*  ITS COURSE     J E S 3    OPERATING
*
*
* WHEN CONVERTING FROM OS-MVT WITH ASP TO OS-MVS AND JES3 AT BMW
* WE HAVE WRITTEN THIS COURSE TO PROVIDE OUR OPERATORS WITH THE
* NECESSARY INFORMATION TO HANDLE THE MACHINES.
*
* WE FOUND, THAT 'ITS' OR COURSEWRITER, IS THE IDEAL THING TO DO THIS.
* EVEN WE HAVE NOT TRIED TO SIMULATE THE OS, THE OPERATOR GETS A FEELING
* HOW THE SYSTEM REACTS AND WHAT HE HAS TO DO.
*
*  C O N T E N T S:
*  ----------------
*
*  1. OPERATOR COURSE FOR BEGINNERS
*     THIS COURSE WAS WRITTEN TO SHOW A FORMER ASP OPERATOR THE MAIN
