  THE ENTRIES UETE02-UETE07 IN THE GAP LIBRARY WILL HELP YOU TO
IMPLEMENT YOUR OWN UTILITIES IN SPF.
  THE CONTRIBUTIONS INCLUDE MENUS, MESSAGES, MACROS AND ASSEMBLER SOURCE
CODE.  IN ORDER TO IMPLEMENT THEM INTO SPF YOU SHOULD ALLOCATE LIBRARIES
TO HOLD YOUR OWN MENUS, MESSAGES AND LOAD MODULES. THIS IS TO KEEP THEM
SEPARATE FROM SPF ONES.  YOUR LIBRARIES SHOULD THEN BE CONCATENATED
IN FRONT OF THE APPROPRIATE SPF LIBRARIES IN THE TSO LOGON PROCEDURE.
   IN ORDER TO REMAIN FLEXIBLE WE HAVE ESTABLISHED THE FOLLOWING
CONVENTIONS AT OUR INSTALLATION:
1. MENU NAMES FOR UTILITIES MUST BE DEFINED IN THE MENU OF THE UTILITY
        DRIVER AND PASSED BY IT TO THE APPROPRIATE UTILITY
2. THE NAMES OF MESSAGES WHICH MAY BE ISSUED BY UTILITIES MUST BE
        DEFINED IN THEIR MENUS AND NOT IN THE MODULES THEMSELVES.
   AN EXAMPLE OF POINT 2 MAY BE FOUND IN THE MENU ETAMGDG WHERE
PARAMETER 7 IS THE NAME 'E320', AN ERROR MESSAGE NUMBER.
