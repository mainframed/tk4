This file contains a simple ISPF Dialog that facilitates the transfer of
data between a workstation and an MVS/TSO session without requiring the
user to exit ISPF to a TSO READY state.

This dialog will also internally invoke the ADMUPCFT clist from GDDM to
support the uploading and downloading of PIF files.  This is detected by
having the character string ADMGDF or ADMCGM as a parameter during the
SEND or RECEIVE.

The dialog is called PCTFHOST, for PC To/From a HOST.  It consists of 3
elements:

1.  The REXX Procedure  (PCTFHOST)
2.  The ISPF Panel      (PCTFHOST)
3.  An entry in the ISPF Commands table (ISPCMDS entry)

This data set is in IEBUPDTE format and contains 3 members:

1.  $README   - What you are reading
2.  EXEC      - The REXX Procedure
3.  PANEL     - The ISPF Panel

Installation Instructions:

A.  Copy the REXX Procedure from member EXEC into a CLIST or REXX
    library concatenated to your ISPF session under either SYSPROC
    or SYSEXEC.  It should be named PCTFHOST.

B.  Copy the ISPF Panel from member PANEL into an ISPF Panels library
    concatenated to your ISPF session under ddname ISPPLIB.  It
    be named PCTFHOST.

C.  The ISPF Command Table entry is added to the ISP Commands Table by:

    1.  Copy ISPCMDS from the existing ISPF Table data set in which it
        resides to your own ISPF Table as PCTCMDS or copy it within the
        existing table data set.
    2.  Enter ISPF Option 3 (Perform Utility Functions) and select optio
        9 (Commands).
    3.  Enter PCT for the Application ID
    4.  Place an I where you see '''' to cause a blank row to be inserte
    5.  Insert the following information on the blank row:

        '''' PCTFHOST  4  SELECT CMD(%PCTFHOST)
                             display command entry panel for PC To/From

    6.  Rename ISPCMDS to OLDCMDS to save it in case you blew it
    7.  Rename PCTCMDS to ISPCMDS
    8.  Exit ISPF
    9.  Enter ISPF and type PCTF (which is a supported abbreviation for
        PCTFHOST ISPF Command)

D. Have fun.
