)F FUNCTION -
   THE PRINTOFF COMMAND CAN BE USED TO OBTAIN HARDCOPY
   OF DATA SETS THROUGH FOREGROUND COPYING TO SYSOUT.
   THE COMMAND PRINTS A DATASET(S) WHICH IS SEQUENTIAL
   OR PARTITIONED, BLOCKED OR UNBLOCKED, WITH FIXED,
   VARIABLE, OR UNDEFINED LENGTH RECORDS OF ANY LENGTH
   UP TO A FULL TRACK.

)O OPERANDS -
))'DSLIST'  - 'DATA SET LIST' CONTAINS THE NAMES OF DATA SETS
            TO BE PRINTED OR PUNCHED.  THE NAMES SHOULD FOLLOW
            TSO CONVENTION,  IN QUOTES IF THE PRIMARY INDEX
            DIFFERS FROM YOUR USERID, OR WITHOUT QUOTES AND
            WITH THE PRIMARY INDEX OMITTED IF IT IS THE SAME
            AS YOUR USERID.
))CLASS('CLASS') - SYSOUT CLASS IN WHICH OUTPUT IS TO BE
            PRINTED.  DEFAULT IS A.
))COPIES('NNN') - NUMBER OF COPIES TO BE PRINTED.
            DEFAULT IS 1.
))DEST('REMOTE') - REMOTE LOCATION TO WHICH SYSOUT DATA SETS
            ARE TO BE ROUTED.
))HOLD      - OUTPUT IS TO BE PLACED ON A HOLD QUEUE UPON
            DEALLOCATION.
))NOHOLD    - OUTPUT IS NOT TO BE PLACED ON A HOLD QUEUE
            UPON DEALLOCATION.
))LIST      - MEMBER NAMES ARE ONLY TO BE LISTED UNLESS
            PRINT IS EXPLICITLY STATED.
))NOLIST    - MEMBER NAMES ARE NOT TO BE LISTED (ONLY
            PRINTED UNLESS NOPRINT IS EXPLICITLY STATED).
))MSG       - DISPLAY MESSAGE WHEN DATASET HAS BEEN PRINTED
))NOMSG     - SUPPRESS MESSAGES WHEN DATASET HAS BEEN PRINTED
))PRINT     - MEMBERS ARE ONLY TO BE PRINTED (NOT LISTED
            UNLESS LIST IS EXPLICITLY STATED).
))NOPRINT   - MEMBERS ARE NOT TO BE PRINTED (ONLY LISTED
            UNLESS NOLIST IS EXPLICITLY STATED).
))FORMS('FORM')  - FORM TO BE USED WHEN THE DATA SET IS PRINTED.
                  (1-4 CHARACTER FORM NAME)
))TRAIN('IMAGE') - PRINT IMAGE TO BE USED WHEN PRINTED.
            THIS IS OFTEN CALLED THE UCS.
            (1-4 CHARACTER PRINT IMAGE NAME)
))FCB('FCB') - THE FORMS CONTROL BUFFER
            (1-4 CHARACTER FCB NAME)
))HEADING     - OUTPUT IS TO HAVE HEADING INFORMATION.
                THIS CONTAINS THE DATASET NAME.
))NOHEADING   - OUTPUT IS NOT HAVE HEADING INFORMATION.
))SS        - OUTPUT IS TO BE SINGLE SPACED BETWEEN LINES
))DS        - OUTPUT IS TO BE DOUBLE SPACED BETWEEN LINES
            (MULTIPLE LINE RECORDS WILL NOT BE SPLIT BETWEEN PAGES)
))CAPS      - OUTPUT IS TO BE CONVERTED TO UPPER CASE
            PRIOR TO PRINTING.
))ASA       - SPECIFIES THAT THE DATASET CONTAINS ASA CARRIAGE CONTROL
            EVEN THOUGH THE DSCB DOES NOT.
))MACH      - SPECIFIES THAT THE DATASET CONTAINS MACH CARRIAGE CONTROL
            EVEN THOUGH THE DSCB DOES NOT.
))ASIS      - OUTPUT IS NOT TO BE CONVERTED TO UPPER CASE
            PRIOR TO PRINTING.(IT IS LEFT AS IT IS)
))LINELENGTH=LL('NNN') - NUMBER OF CHARACTERS ON EACH LINE OF
            PRINTED OUTPUT BETWEEN 1 AND 208 CHARACTERS WITH A DEFAULT
            OF 132.  LINES LONGER THAN SPECIFIED LINELENGTH WILL
            BE PRINTED ON MULTIPLE LINES.
))PAGELENGTH=PL('NN') - NUMBER OF LINES PER PAGE, BETWEEN 1 AND 120
            LINES WITH A DEFAULT OF 60.
))NOPL      NO LINE COUNTING FOR PAGINATION WILL TAKE PLACE
))VOLUME('VOLSER') - VOLUME SERIAL OF VOLUME ON WHICH DATA SETS
            TO BE PRINTED ARE FOUND.  THIS VOLUME SERIAL
            WILL BE USED FOR ALL DATA SETS SPECIFIED IN
            THE DATA SET LIST.
))BURST     SPECIFIES THAT THE PAPER IS TO BE OUTPUT TO THE
            BURSTER-TRIMMER-STACKER OF THE 3800

            CONTINUOUS FORMS STACKER OF THE 3800
))CHARS     SPECIFIES A LIST OF CHARACTER ARRANGMENTS TO BE USED TO
            PRINT THE OUTPUT ON THE 3800

))NOCC      CARRIAGE CONTROL IS IGNORED AND PRINTED AS DATA
))RCL       THE RETURN CODE IS TO CONTAIN THE PRINTED LINE COUNT
))OUTDES(output-descriptor-name,...)
            The OUTDES operand specifies a list of output descriptors
            for the SYSOUT data set. Each operand may have 1 to 8
            characters and a maximum of 128 output descriptors may be
            specified.

            Note: Operands which were already specified with an output
                  descriptor (like BURST, CHARS, COPIES, etc.) may be
                  overridden by specifying the corresponding operand
                  with the PRINTDS command.
