)F FUNCTION -

  The KERMIT command invokes Kermit-TSO, an assembly language program
which implements the Kermit file transfer protocol on IBM System/370
and XA mainframe computers and compatibles running the MVS (Multiple
Virtual Storage) operating system with the TSO (Time Sharing Option)
subsystem.  Kermit-TSO supports file transfer in line-mode operation.

)X SYNTAX -
         KERMIT

   Required - None
   Defaults - None
   Alias    - None
   Note     - The Kermit "?" help feature is available when entering
              Kermit-TSO subcommands.  A subcommand followed by a space
              and a question mark and entered with a carriage return
              will display a brief description of what is expected or
              possible at that point.

            - When connecting in several flags must first be set on the
              local Kermit.  The following are the defaults and other
              possibilities for those values:

              Baud             whatever the site supports
              Data bits        7
              Stop bits        1
              Flow-control     None
              Handshake        XON × None
              Local-echo       on (half-duplex)
              Parity           even × mark × odd

            - When sending files to Kermit-TSO, if the record format
              is fixed (RECFM=F), any record longer than the logical
              record length (LRECL) will be truncated to that value.
              If the record format is variable or undefined (RECFM=V
              or RECFM=U), the record length can be as high as 32760,
              provided the disk device tracksize is not exceeded.

            - When sending files from Kermit-TSO, the maximum logical
              record length is 32760 (LRECL=32760).

            - When sending files to Kermit-TSO, the local Kermit must
              use a carriage return as the end-of-line (EOL) character.

            - This version of Kermit-TSO does not support timeouts;
              therefore, the user should press the carriage return key
              on the microcomputer or use the timeout facility of the
              local Kermit, if supported, after long periods of update
              inactivity during file transfer.

)F FUNCTION -
           Initiates file transfer to Kermit-TSO from the local Kermit.

           - If the optional 'dataset-name' is not specified,
             Kermit-TSO will use the name(s) provided by the local
             Kermit.  If no dataset exists with this name, one will
             be created using the file attribute and space values in
             effect when the RECEIVE subcommand was entered.
           - If the 'dataset-name' specified is the same as an existing
             dataset, Kermit-TSO will prompt the user for the option to
             overwrite the dataset.
           - If the 'dataset-name' was not specified, but is the same
             as an existing dataset,  Kermit-TSO will not overwrite the
             dataset unless the WARNING parameter has been set to OFF.

                 written.

=SEND=SEN
)F FUNCTION -
           Initiates file transfer from Kermit-TSO to the local Kermit.

           - Only one dataset per request may be sent;
             "wildcarding" is not supported.
           - If the 'dataset-name' is not specified,
             Kermit-TSO will prompt for it.
           - The 'dataset-name' must be cataloged.

)O OPERANDS -
))DATASET-NAME - Specifies the name of the dataset to be sent.

=SERVER=SER
)F FUNCTION -
           Invokes Kermit-TSO server mode.

           - Once Kermit-TSO enters server mode, it only accepts
             subcommands entered at the local Kermit; any non-default
             parameters must be SET before invoking this mode.
           - The local Kermit must support 'remote' subcommands to
             communicate with Kermit-TSO in this mode.  The remote
             subcommands Kermit-TSO supports are as follows:

             SEND   - Send a file to Kermit-TSO;
             GET    - Get a file from Kermit-TSO;
             FINISH - Terminate server mode and return to the
                      Kermit-TSO prompt;
             BYE    - Terminate server mode, exit Kermit-TSO and
                      logoff TSO.

           - If supported by the local Kermit, groups of files may
             be sent to Kermit-TSO via wildcards.  Kermit-TSO
             will not, however, send groups of files when using
             the remote GET subcommand.

))ATOE 'num1' 'num2' - Modifies the ASCII-to-EBCDIC translate table
                       used by Kermit-TSO for all translations other
                       than ACF/NCP.  This table corresponds to the
                       Kermit standard translate table as defined in
                       the Kermit protocol specifications.

                the ASCII offset within the table.
       'num2' - A decimal number between 0 and 255 for the EBCDIC
                value at that offset.

))ATOENCP 'num1' 'num2' - Modifies the ASCII-to-EBCDIC translate table
                          used by Kermit-TSO for all translations used
                          with ACF/NCP.  This table must correspond to
                          the site ACF/NCP translate table.

          'num2' - A decimal number between 0 and 255 for the EBCDIC
                   value at that offset.

))BLKSIZE 'number' - Specifies the block size for datasets created
                     by Kermit-TSO.  Maximum is 32760.  The default
                     is 3600.

))BLOCK '1 × 2 × 3' - Specifies the type of block check used during
                      file transfer.  The default is 1.
                      '1' - A one character checksum.
                      '2' - A two character checksum.
                      '3' - A three character CRC.

))DEBUG 'ON × OFF' - If ON, keep a journal of all packets sent and
                     received in the file KERMLOG.  If OFF, stop
                     logging the packets and close the file.  Default
                     is OFF.

              Note:  Packets sent by Kermit-TSO are distinguished by
                     a carriage return (X'0D') at the end; packets
                     received have had it stripped by the front end
                     processor.

))DELAY 'number' - Specifies the number of seconds Kermit-TSO will
                   delay before beginning to send packets after the
                   SEND subcommand has been entered.  Default is 12.

))DIRECTORY 'number' - Specifies the number of directory blocks to
                       allocate if the dataset created with the
                       RECEIVE subcommand is partitioned.  Default
                       is 10.

))END 'number' - Specifies the decimal value of the ASCII character
                 used for the packet-terminator or end-of-line.  The
                 'number' must be between 0 and 31.  The default is
                 a carriage return (13).

))ETOA 'num1' 'num2' - Modifies the EBCDIC-to-ASCII translate table
                       used by Kermit-TSO for all translations other
                       than ACF/NCP.  This table corresponds to the
                       Kermit standard translate table as defined in
                       the Kermit protocol specifications.
       'num1' - A decimal number between 0 and 255 for the value of
                the EBCDIC offset within the table.
       'num2' - A decimal number between 0 and 255 for the ASCII
                value at that offset.

))ETOANCP 'num1' 'num2' - Modifies the EBCDIC-to-ASCII translate table
                          used by Kermit-TSO for all translations used
                          with ACF/NCP.  This table must correspond to
                          the site ACF/NCP translate table.
          'num1' - A decimal number between 0 and 255 for the value of
                   the EBCDIC offset within the table.
          'num2' - A decimal number between 0 and 255 for the ASCII
                   value at that offset.

))FILE 'Binary × Text × V-binary' - Specifies the file-type of the
                                    data and determines the type of
                                    translation, if any, to use.
        Binary   - Specifies non-delimited, bit-stream data.  No trans-
                   lation is performed, and no carriage return/linefeed
                   pairs are added to outgoing records.  Incoming bytes
                   are added successively to the current record, which
                   is written out when the specified logical record
                   length (LRECL) is reached.
        Text     - Specifies textual data.  ASCII-to-EBCDIC and
                   EBCDIC-to-ASCII translation is performed on the
                   data using the defined translate tables.  Carriage
                   return/linefeed pairs are used to delimit the
                   records.  This is the default.
        V-binary - Specifies variable-length binary records.  No trans-
                   lation is performed, and no carriage return/linefeed
                   pairs are added to outgoing records.  A two-byte
                   binary prefix which indicates the number of data
                   bytes in the record is added to each outgoing record.
                   Incoming records are stripped of their prefixes and
                   written out when the prefix value is reached.  This
                   is useful when the record format is unformatted
                   (RECFM=U) or variable (RECFM=V).

))LRECL 'number' - Specifies the logical record length for the file
                   being received from the local Kermit.  The 'number'
                   must be from 1 to 32760 (32K) decimal.  Default
                   is 80.

))PACKET-SIZE 'number' - Specifies the maximum length for incoming
                         packets.  The 'number' must be from 26 to
                         9024 decimal.  Default is 94.
                  Note:  - Packets from 26 to 94 bytes are considered
                         standard length packets and are supported
                         by most versions of Kermit.
                         - Packets from 95 bytes to 9024 bytes are
                         considered long length packets and are
                         supported by recent versions of Kermit.
                         - TELENET uses 128 byte packets.

))PRIMARY 'number' - Specifies the number (decimal) of tracks for the
                     primary space allocation for files being received
                     from the local Kermit.  Default is 1.

))QUOTE 'character' - Specifies the indicated printable character as
                      the prefix (quote) character for control and
                      other prefix characters.  This character must
                      be in the decimal range 33-62, 96, or 123-126.
                      Default is '#'.
               Note:  Do not change this parameter unless transferring
                      a long file which contains many '#' characters.

))RECFM 'F × V × U' - Specifies the record format for the file being
                      received from the local Kermit.  Default is F.
                      F - Fixed (RECFM=F)
                      V - Variable (RECFM=V)
                      U - Undefined (RECFM=U)

))SECONDARY 'number' - Specifies the number (decimal) of tracks for
                       the secondary space allocation for files being
                       received from the local Kermit.  Default is 1.

))TABS 'DEFAULT × OFF × ON × ON(tab-list)' - Enables or disables tab
                                             expansion for files being
                                             received from the local
                                             Kermit.  Default is OFF.
                  DEFAULT      - Enables expansion and specifies use
                                 of default tab settings for the IBM
                                 PC.
                  OFF          - Disables expansion.
                  ON           - Enables expansion and specifies use
                                 of the current tab values.
                  ON(tab-list) - Enables expansion and specifies use
                                 of tab stops listed in 'tab-list'.

))WARNING 'ON × OFF' - Specifies the course of action when a file
                       being received from the local Kermit has the
                       same name as a dataset which already exists.
                       - If ON, Kermit-TSO changes the incoming file
                       name so as not to obliterate the existing
                       dataset.  Kermit-TSO attempts to rename the
                       incoming file by adding sufficient digits to the
                       first level of the dataset name up to the limit
                       of eight characters.  The sequence of characters
                       starts with 1 and continues up to 99 and uses
                       leading zeros to fill out the eight-character
                       name.  This is the default.
                       - If OFF, Kermit-TSO will replace the existing
                       dataset with the file being received.
