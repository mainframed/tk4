)F     DEBUGGER - FUNCTION
       THE DEBUGGER IS USED TO DISPLAY AND/OR MODIFY
       VIRTUAL MEMORY.
       CURRENTLY, ONLY THE VIRTUAL ADDRESS SPACE OF THE CALLER IS
       AVAILABLE.
       BOTH UNPROTECTED AND PROTECTED STORAGE MAY BE EXAMINED
       AND ALTERED.
)S     DEBUGGER - SUBCOMMANDS:
       <ADDR>    - DISPLAY STORAGE AROUND THE GIVEN ADDRESS
                   EXAMPLE - 1204 - DISPLAY AROUND LOCATION 1204 (HEX)
       ASCB      - DISPLAY THE ASCB OF THE NAMED ADDRESS SPACE
                   EXAMPLE - ASCB'TSDWSF' - ASCB FOR TSDWSF IS LOCATED
       C         - DISPLAY AROUND ADDRESS THAT IS COMPLEMENT OF
                   CURRENT ADDRESS
       CSCB      - DISPLAY THE CSCB OF THE NAMED ADDRESS SPACE
                   EXAMPLE - CSCB'TSDWSF' - CSCB OF TSDWSF IS LOCATED
       D         - DISPLAY AN ADDRESS IN MEMORY
                   EXAMPLES- D01234 - DISPLAY LOCATION 1234 (HEX)
                             DBARF  - LOC AROUND VALUE OF NAME 'BARF'
       DELETE    - DELETE A LOAD MODULE LOADED VIA THE 'LOAD' COMMAND
                   EXAMPLE - DELETE'IEFIIC' DELETES THE NAMED MODULE
       END       - LEAVE DEBUGGER
       F         - FULLWORD INDIRECT ADDRESS FROM CURRENT DISPLAY ADDR
       H         - HALFWORD INDIRECT FROM CURRENT DISPLAY ADDR
       HELP      - REQUEST FOR HELP TEXT (YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT)
       LOAD      - LOAD A MODULE
                   EXAMPLE - LOAD'IEFIIC' LOADS THE NAMED MODULE,
                   THE CURRENT DISPLAY ADDRESS IS SET TO THE NAMED
                   ENTRY POINT.  TO FIND OFFSET ZERO IN THE MODULE,
                   YOU MAY USE THE '?C' COMMAND.
       UCB       - DISPLAY THE UCB FOR A DEVICE
                   EXAMPLE - UCB00F - FIND UCB FOR DEVICE '00F'
       =         - ASSIGN A NAME TO CURRENT DISPLAY ADDRESS
                   EXAMPLE - =QQ - ASSIGN CURRENT ADDR TO NAME 'QQ'
       %         - INVOKE AN EXEC FROM SYSPROC
                   EXAMPLE - %CVT - INVOKE 'CVT' EXEC FROM SYSPROC
                   N O T E - 'CONTROL LIST' IN A CLIST WILL NOT HAVE
                             ANY EFFECT.  THE STACK WILL BE FLUSHED
                             AT THE FIRST INVALID COMMAND.
       <         - BACKUP IN DISPLAY TRACE TABLE
                   EXAMPLE - <<< - BACK UP THREE ENTRIES
       >         - FORWARD IN DISPLAY TRACE TABLE
                   EXAMPLE - >>> - GO FORWARD THREE ENTRIES
       ?C        - DISPLAY LOADED MODULE INFORMATION
       ?N        - DISPLAY NAME TABLE
       ?T        - DISPLAY TRACE TABLE
       +         - ADD TO CURRENT DISPLAY ADDRESS AND DISPLAY
                   EXAMPLE - +40 - ADD X'40' TO CURRENT LOCATION
                             QQ+40 - ADD X'40' TO VALUE OF NAME 'QQ'
                                     AND DISPLAY THAT LOCATION
       -         - SUBTRACT FROM CURRENT DISPLAY ADDRESS AND DISPLAY
                   EXAMPLE - -40 - SUB X'40' FROM CURRENT LOCATION
                             QQ-40 - SUB X'40' FROM VALUE OF NAME 'QQ'
                                     AND DISPLAY THAT LOCATION
       ,         - SEPARATE COMMANDS
                   EXAMPLE - 10,F,F,+4,F - FINDS CURRENT TCB
                   N O T E - ',' CANNOT BE USED ON THE SAME INPUT
                             LINE AS A '%' INVOCATION OF A CLIST.
       *         - REDISPLAY CURRENT CORE ADDRESS
       (BLANKS)  - SAME AS '*'
       ANYTHING ELSE IS TAKEN AS AN ADDRESS TO
                 DISPLAY (NAMES MAY BE USED AS ADDRESSES)
)X     DEBUGGER - SYNTAX
       DEBUGGER

       THE DEBUGGER IS RESTRICTED TO TECHNICAL SUPPORT
                 MAINTENANCE PERSONNEL.
       ANY OTHER PERSON REQUESTING THE DEBUGGER WILL
                 BE RETURNED TO READY MODE.

       SPECIFYING AN ADDRESS IN EITHER HEXIDECIMAL OR DECIMAL
       WILL CAUSE DEBUGGER TO DISPLAY STORAGE AROUND THAT ADDRESS.

       EXAMPLES OF THE SYNTAX OF ADDRESS AND VALUES ARE AS FOLLOWS:
             01234DF   -  HEXIDECIMAL SELF DEFINING TERM
             123456.   -  DECIMAL     SELF DEFINING TERM
             'ABCDEF'  -  CHARACTER   SELF DEFINING TERM

       -- THE VALUE OF <ADDR> AND <VALUE> USED IN THE FOLLOWING
          DISPLAYS IS DETERMINED AS FOLLOWS:
          NUMBERS AND HEX DIGITS ENTERED WITHOUT A TRAILING '.'
          ARE INTERPRETED IN ALL CASES TO BE 'HEX';
          IF FOLLOWED BY A '.', IT IS INTERPRETED TO BE
          'DECIMAL'
                 (NOTE: FOR PURPOSES OF STORAGE ALTERING COMMANDS,
                  THE LENGTH OF STORAGE TO BE ALTERED IS ALWAYS:
                  1+LEN_ENTERED/2 DROPPING ANY REMAINDER FOR HEX,
                  4 FOR DECIMAL,AND
                  LEN_ENTERED FOR CHARACTER.
                  THE MAXIMUM LENGTH IS:
                  8 HEX DIGITS, OR
                  8 CHARACTERS, OR
                  AS MUCH AS 1 FULLWORD (DECIMAL)

          FOR PURPOSES OF INTERMEDIATE COMPUTATION, ALL
          VALUES ARE KEPT IN A FULLWORD, WITH HI ORDER BITS
          TRUNCATED AS NECESSARY.
                 (E.G.  D123456789 - WOULD BE INTERPRETED AS
                        D23456789)

          IF THE INPUT FOR AN <ADDR> VALUE IS INVALID,
          I.E. CONTAINS NON-HEX CHARACTERS, IT WILL BE ASSUMED
          TO BE A NAME.  IF IT IS NOT FOUND IN THE NAME TABLE,
          AN ERROR MESSAGE WILL BE DISPLAYED WITH A BAR ('×') UNDER
          THE APPROXIMATE LOCATION OF THE ERROR, IF POSSIBLE.

          <VALUE> INFORMATION MUST BE ENTERED AS A SELF-DEFINING
          TERM IN HEX, OR DECIMAL (FOLLOWED BY A '.'), OR
          CHARACTER (STRING OF CHARACTERS SURROUNDED BY, AND
          CONTAINING NO, SINGLE QUOTES ('))

       NOTE -
                 SINCE 'B','C',AND 'D' ARE COMMANDS, HEX NUMBERS
                 BEGINNING WITH THESE VALUES MUST BE SPECIFIED WITH
                 A LEADING ZERO.
                 NAMES BEGINNING WITH THESE LETTERS SHOULD BE AVOIDED.
)O    NO OPERANDS ARE REQUIRED ON THE DEBUGGER COMMAND.
