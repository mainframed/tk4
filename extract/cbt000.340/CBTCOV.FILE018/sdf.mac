)F FUNCTION -
  The SDF command invokes the JES3 Spool Display Facility.
  SDF must be called from within an ISPF environment.

  SDF allows the user to perform the following functions:
  - search/display the JES3 job queue
  - browse both held and non-held SYSOUT/SYSIN data sets
  - requeue job output for entire job or selected data sets
  - copy job output to a data set
  - reprint job output
  - transmit output to a VM system
  - modify/delete output on both the hold and writer queues
  - cancel jobs (including DJC network jobs)
  - place jobs on hold and release jobs
  - receive data sets from another node
  - display the system log by system/date/time
  - display scrollable JES3 console

  for detailed information, use the ISPF help panels.

)O OPERANDS -

))option   - Specifies any valid option that can be selected from the
             SDF main selection panel.  Causes the specified option
             to be selected without displaying the selection panel.

             Valid select options that can be specified are:
             J - perform JOB queue functions
             L - perform system LOG functions
             R - receive data sets from another node
             B - browse hexadecimal spool data
             C - console display
             P - specify SDF parameter defaults
             T - SDF tutorial

))SSI      - Specifies that regular system services are to be used
             for spool access.  This is the default mode and allows
             access only to spool data sets within the user's JES3
             complex.

))NOSSI    - Specifies that no system services are to be used for
             spool access.  This allows read-only access to spool
             data sets in another JES3 complex.  Many internal SDF
             options and features are unavailable when NOSSI is
             specified.

))CHKPNT(ddname) - Specifies a ddname to which the JES3 checkpoint
             data set has been allocated.  This operand is used only
             when NOSSI is specified.  If NOSSI is specified and this
             parameter is omitted, a panel will be displayed for the
             user to the data set name and volser of the JES3
             checkpoint data set for the system to be accessed.

))TRACE(n) - This parameter activates an internal trace table of all
             subroutine calls, returns, register contents, and return
             codes.  The value "n" specifies the size of the trace table
             in 1K units.  This operand is intended for diagnostic
             purposes only.  It will generally be used by installation
             support personnel only.

))MAP      - This parameter causes a panel to be displayed during SDF
             initialization giving a map of SDF entry points and major
             data areas.  This enables SDF execution to be traced on a
             virtual machine under VM using the CP TRACE command.  This
             operand is intended for diagnostic purposes only.  It will
             generally be used by installation support personnel only.
