)F Function -

   The DCF text formatter, SCRIPT/VS, processes documents marked up with
   its own control words or Generalized Markup Language (GML) tags.  GML
   tags are a shorthand text markup used to describe document parts or
   elements which may be used instead of explicit SCRIPT/VS control
   words.  SCRIPT/VS formats documents for printing on IBM Page
   Printers, PostScript devices (configured to accept 8-bit ASCII), IBM
   Line Printers, or any printer functionally equivalent at the
   data-stream level.

))file-id   - is the name of the primary input file.  When the input
              file contains imbedded or appended files, file-id names
              the primary or master file; the imbedded and appended
              files are named with control words in the master file.
              The format of the file-id is:

              Specified file-id    ×    Actual file-id
              _____________________________________________
              A                    ×    userid.A.TEXT
              A.TEXT               ×    userid.A.TEXT
              DOC(CHAP1)           ×    userid.DOC.TEXT(CHAP1)
              'ABC.D.EF'           ×    'ABC.D.EF'
              (CHAP2)              ×    userid.TEXT(CHAP2)

              A file-id of ? will cause SCRIPT/VS to display a list
              of all the valid command options.

))BIND      - The BIND option causes SCRIPT/VS to shift the formatted
              output of each page to the right side of the paper.
              The BIND option is specified as:

              BIND(obind  ebind)
               or
              BIND(bind)

              You can specify a binding for odd-numbered paged (obind)
              and a different binding for even-numbered pages (ebind).
              Binding values can be given in any valid space unit.

              Note: you can override these values with the .PM control
              word.

              Abbreviation: B

))CHARS     - The CHARS option identifies the fonts to be used and is
              specified as:

              CHARS(font1,font2,....)

              For page devices, you specify an 8 character font
              identifier.  A maximum of 31 fonts can be specified. If
              you do not specify the CHARS option, the default font
              specified for the logical device is used.  In either
              case, the first font specified or implied becomes the
              initial font.

              When formatting for page printers the FONTLIB option is
              used to identify the host system font library containing
              the fonts to be used.

              Abbreviation: CH

))CONTINUE  - The CONTINUE options allows processing to continue after
              SCRIPT/VS detects an error condition and issues an error
              message.  When SCRIPT/VS encounters an error that is too
              severe for processing to continue, it stops processing
              even when CONTINUE is specified.

              It is specified as:

              CONTINUE

              Abbreviation: CO

))CTF       - Prepare output in STAIRS/VS Condensed Text Format The CTF
              option is specified as:

              CTF

              This option specifies that the document be prepared as
              input for the STAIRS/VS licensed program.  SCRIPT/VS
              output is placed in Condensed Text Format blocks and
              written to a file named userid.DSMUTCTF.TEXT.  The
              STAIRS logical device is assumed when this option is
              requested and the CTF option is ignored if any other
              logical device is specified.

              Abbreviation: CT

))DDUT      - Enable SCRIPT/VS Utility File Retention. The DDUT option
              is specified as:

              DDUT

              This option allows the redefinition of SCRIPT/VT utility
              files to non-utility file names using the .DD (Define
              Data File-id) control word.

              Abbreviation: DD

))DEST      - Name a remote output station

              DEST(printer-name)

              This option is used to specify the name of a printer at
              which the formatted output is to be printed.  The
              printer-name may be from one to eight characters.

              Abbreviation: DES

))DEVICE    - The DEVICE option allows the user to identify the type
              of output device for which the document will be formatted.

))FILE      - The FILE option directs the formatted output document to a
              direct access file.  If the DEVICE option is not also
              specified, the 1403W6 logical device is assumed.  The
              FILE option is specified as:

              FILE(file-id)

              where file-id is a fully or partially qualified data set
              name.  The full name will be determined as follows based
              on the input file data set name:

              - line devices - "TEXT" is replaced with "LIST"
              - 4250 devices - "TEXT" is replaced with "LIST4250"
              - 38PP devices - "TEXT" is replaced with "LIST38PP"
              - 3820 devices - "TEXT" is replaced with "LIST3820"

              For example when DEV(3820A) is specified:

              The FONTLIB option is specified as:

              FONTLIB(data set name)

              Note that this option should not be required to be
              specified as it should default to the correct font library
              based upon the specified logical device type.

              Abbreviation: FO

))FPASSES   - The FPASSES option specifies the number of formatting
              passes SCRIPT/VS performs when processing an input file.
              These passes process all control words, but output occurs
              only after the last pass.  FPASSES and TWOPASS are
              mutually exclusive.  The FPASSES option is specified as:

              FPASSES(n)

              where n is the number of formatting passes SCRIPT/VS
              performs.

              Abbreviation: FP

))INDEX     - The INDEX option enables the .PI (Put Index) control word
              or the GML Tag :INDEX.  The INDEX option is specified as:

))LIB       - The LIB option specifies the library SCRIPT/VS will search
              for a definition of the symbols and macros not defined
              within the input file.  The LIB option is specified as:

              LIB(data set name)

              If more than one library is required then omit this option
              and preallocate ddname SCRPTLIB prior to invoking
              SCRIPT/VS.

              Abbreviation: L

))MESSAGE   - The MESSAGE option controls the amount and timing of the
              information SCRIPT/VS provides with error messages.  The
              MESSAGE option is specified as:

              MESSAGE ( DELAY ID TRACE )

              DELAY requests that SCRIPT/VS not display messages while a
              document is being displayed or printed.  SCRIPT/VS will
              append the messages to the end of the formatted output.

              ID causes SCRIPT/VS to include the error message
              identifier along with the error messages.

              TRACE causes SCRIPT/VS to list the sequence of imbedded
              files.

              These options can each be abbreviated as a single
              character.

              Note:  the MESSAGE option should always be specified
                     before any other command option.

              Abbreviation: M

))NOCONT    - The NOCONT option ends processing after SCRIPT/VS
              encounters an error condition and issues an error message.
              This is the default.  The NOCONT option is specified as:

              NOCONT

              Abbreviation: NOC

))NODDUT    - The NODDUT option disallows the redefinition of SCRIPT/VS
              utility files to non-utility file names using the .DD
              (Define Data File-id) control word.  This is the default.
              The NODDUT option is specified as:

              NODDUT

              Abbreviation: NOD

))NOPROF    - The NOPROF option requests that SCRIPT/VS not imbed a a
              profile document.  The NOPROF option is specified as:

              Abbreviation: NOSP

))NOWAIT    - The NOWAIT option causes SCRIPT/VS to send output to your
              terminal without first prompting you to adjust the paper.
              NOWAIT is the normal mode for output to all output devices
              except a typewriter terminal.  The NOWAIT option is
              specified as:

              NOWAIT

              Abbreviation: NOW

))NUMBER    - The NUMBER option, for line devices, causes SCRIPT/VS to
              print the file-id and line number of the last line read
              when a formatted output line is printed.  The formatter
              reads ahead and since the number printed is that of the
              last input line read, the number printed may or may not
              correspond to the input line number of the text printed in
              the output line.  The NUMBER option is ignored for page
              printers and PostScript devices. The NUMBER option is
              specified as:

              NUMBER

              Abbreviation: NU

))PAGE      - The PAGE option allows you to print pages of formatted
              output selectively.  The page number need not be an
              integer; you can use the .PN (Page Numbering Model)
              control word to establish decimal, alphabetic, and Roman
              numeral page numbers, and attach a prefix to each page
              number.  The first eight characters of the page number you
              specify with the PAGE option is the character string that
              SCRIPT/VS compares to the current page number symbol.  The
              PAGE option has several formats, and any number of page
              range specifications can be included in the PAGE option.

              Valid forms of the page range specification are:

              PROMPT
              (FROM) frompage (TO) topage
              (FROM) frompage FOR n-pages
              (FROM) page ONLY

              Examples of valid page option specifications:

              PAGE(FROM 10 TO 15)
              PAGE(7 8)
              PAGE(2 TO 5)
              PAGE(FROM 94.1 FOR 3 99 ONLY)
              PAGE(viii ONLY 93 TO *)

              An asterisk (*) specified as frompage is interpreted
              as the current page; an asterisk specified as topage
              means the last page in the document.

))PRINT     - The PRINT option causes SCRIPT/VS to send the output
              document to a printer.  If the DEVICE option is not
              specified, SCRIPT/VS assumes the 1403W6 logical device
              type.  The PRINT option is specified as:

              PRINT(copies,class,fcb,ucs)

              copies is the number of copies desired, and defaults
              to "1".

              class is the SYSOUT class, and defaults to "A".

              fcb is the forms control buffer name.

              ucs is the universal character set.

))PROFILE   - The PROFILE option names the file that SCRIPT/VS is to
              use as the profile for the document being formatted.  A
              profile can contain frequently used symbol and macro
              definitions, GML application processing functions, and
              text appropriate for many documents.  The PROFILE option
              is specified as:

              PROFILE(data set name)

              Abbreviation: PRO

))PSOUT     - The PSOUT option specifies whether SCRIPT/VS generates
              PostScript output in ASCII or EBCDIC when a PostScript
              device is specified with the DEVICE option.  PSOUT is
              specified as:

              PSOUT(ASCII)
                 or
              PSOUT(EBCDIC)

              Abbreviation: PS

))QUIET     - The QUIET option causes SCRIPT/VS to suppress (not
              display) the version identification message that is
              otherwise typed or displayed as a response to the SCRIPT
              command.  The QUIET option is specified as:

              QUIET

              Abbreviation: Q

))SEARCH    - The SEARCH option causes SCRIPT/VS to search the specified
              library or partitioned data set for imbedded or appended
              files.  The SEARCH option is specified as:

              SEARCH(data set name)

              Abbreviation: SEA

))SEGLIB    - The SEGLIB option specifies the library SCRIPT/VS is to
              reference for page segments during the formatting process
              when it encounters the .SI (Segment Include) control word.

              SEGLIB(data set name)

              Abbreviation: SEG

))SPELLCHK  - The SPELLCHK option causes SCRIPT/VS to verify the
              spelling of the words in the input document.  The SPELLCHK
              option is specified as:

              SPELLCHK

              Abbreviation: SP

))STOP      - The STOP option causes SCRIPT/VS to wait for you to
              press the return (enter) key before starting to type
              each page.  Use this option when printing your output
              document on separate sheets of paper at a typewriter
              terminal.  The STOP option is specified as:

              STOP

))SYOFF     - The SYOFF option, which is the default, disables the .SY
              (System Command) control word.  The SYOFF option is
              specified as:

              SYOFF

              Abbreviation: SYOF


))SYON      - The SYON option enables the .SY (System Command) control
              word.  The SYON option is specified as:

              SYON

              Abbreviation: SYON

))SYSVAR    - The SYSVAR option allows you to pass information to
              SCRIPT/VS as symbols defined when you issue the
              SCRIPT command.  The SYSVAR option is specified as:

              SYSVAR (x value ... y value)

              Each 'x value' pair causes the symbol &SYSVARx to be set
              to the 'value'.  'x' is any alphameric character
              identifying the token.  'Value' is any alphameric string
              of up to eight characters, and cannot contain imbedded
              blanks or parenthesis.  Note: the 'value' is always
              translated to upper case.

))TERM      - The TERM option causes SCRIPT/VS to send the output
              document to your terminal.  If the DEVICE option is not
              specified, SCRIPT/VS assumes the logical device TERM and
              displays the document on your terminal.  The TERM option
              is specified as:

              TERM

              Abbreviation: TE

))TWOPASS   - The TWOPASS option causes SCRIPT/VS to process the input
              file in two passes.  Both passes process all control
              words, but output occurs only on the second pass.  TWOPASS
              and FPASSES are mutually exclusive, therefore the last one
              specified is the one that takes effect.  The TWOPASS
              option is specified as:

              TWOPASS

              Abbreviation: TW

))UNFORMAT  - The UNFORMAT option generally lists only those input lines
              that are processed by SCRIPT/VS.  For example, input lines
              that are bypassed because of a .GO (Goto) control word or
              a .CS (Conditional Section) control word are not shown in
              the unformatted listing.  Note:  the UNFORMAT option is
              ignored for page printers and PostScript devices.  The
              UNFORMAT option is specified as:

              UNFORMAT

              Abbreviation: UN

))UPCASE    - The UPCASE option causes SCRIPT/VS to convert, for the
              formatted output document only, all lowercase letters
              to uppercase.  The UPCASE option is specified as:
