)F  ABENDAID
    ABENDAID IS A UTILITY THAT HAS BEEN INSTALLED TO ASSIST IN ANALYZING
    PROGRAM ABENDS.  IT INTERCEPTS THE ABEND AT THE TIME WHEN IT WOULD
    BE FORMATTED FOR OUTPUT ON SYSUDUMP  OR SYSABEND AND PERFORMS AN
    ANALYSIS TO ATTEMPT TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THE DUMP.  IN MANY
    CASES THIS ANALYSIS WHICH IS REPORTED IN A ONE OR TWO PAGE SUMMARY
    IS MORE THAN ADEQUETE TO RESOLVE THE PROBLEM.

    ABENDAID REQUIRES THAT SYSUDUMP OR SYSABEND BE ALLOCATED FOR ITS
    ANALYSIS TO BE INVOKED.

)S  IN ADDITION TO THE ANALYSIS, ABENDAID ALLOWS THE USER TO TAILOR
    THE FORMATTING GENERATED BY THE PRESENCE OF THE FOLLOWING DD'S.


  DDNAME                  ACTION TAKEN BY ABENDAID

  ABNLDUMP DD DUMMY   -   FORCES NORMAL SYSUDUMP/SYSABEND IN ADDITION
                          TO ABEND-AID OUTPUT.
  ABNLODP DD DUMMY    -   ABEND-AID SUPRESSES THE SYSUDUMP/SYSABEND
                          WHETHER IT WOULD HAVE BEEN PRODUCED OR NOT.
  ABNLIGNR DD DUMMY   -   NO ABEND-AID PROCESSING TAKES PLACE.
  ABNLWSPT DD DUMMY   -   ABEND-AID WILL FORMAT THE WORKING-STORAGE
                          OF A VS-COBOL PROGRAM
  ABNLFMTD DD DUMMY   -   ABEND-AID WILL PRODUCE THE FORMATED PORTIONS
                          OF A SYSUDUMP BUT WILL SUPPRESS THE ACTUAL
                          STORAGE PRINT.
  ABNLSPRT DD DUMMY   _   ABEND-AID WIL ATTEMPT TO PRINT THE RECORDS
                          THAT ARE BEING PROCESSED IN THEIR ENTIRETY.
                          THE DEFAULT IS TO PRINT THE FIRST 100 BYTES.
  ABENDAID DD SYSOUT=A -  ABEND-AID WILL PRINT ON SYSOUT=A AND THE
                          NORMAL SYSUDUMP/SYSABEND WILL BE PROCESSED
                          NORMALLY.  THIS ALLOWS SEPERATION OF THE
                          OUTPUTS.
  ABNLHELP DD SYSOUT=A -  ABEND-AID PRINTS A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF HOW
                          TO USE THE ABEND-AID OUTPUT.
