 "CALC - TSO CALCULATOR PROGRAM"
  =============================

 GENERAL
   The TSO command CALC is a program that evaluates arithmetic
   expressions using the operators +, -, * (multiply), / (divide), and
   ** (exponentiate) and a number of builtin functions.  All answers are
   placed in an accumulator called 'A'.  The calculator also maintains
   ten scratch-pad registers which are accessible to the user.  For more
   information type 'HELP SYNTAX', 'HELP COMMANDS', 'HELP FUNCTIONS',
   'HELP SUBCOMMANDNAME', or 'HELP ALL' when CALC is active.


 SYNTAX
   Enter expressions in the usual mathematical infix notation with or
   without blanks separating the operators and operands with the
   following exceptions:
     1.  Do NOT leave blanks between the 'R' and 'S' register commands
         and their associated register numbers.
     2.  To continue a line, end it with a dash ('-') and continue on
         the next line.  the dash will not be interpreted as a minus.
         A line may be broken for continuation anywhere that a blank
         would be legal.
     3.  Commands 'LEARN', 'EXECUTE', 'ERASE', 'HELP' and 'END' should
         be typed alone on new lines.
   For example, if you type '2+3*4', the calculator will respond 'A=14'


 COMMANDS
   END -  End the calculator session.  Note:  the program will request
          confirmation of your end command (enter 'END' again).  END is
          also used to terminate a learn function.

   PRINT - Determines printing options.  abbreviation:  'PR'.
             Syntax is:  PRINT option   or  PRINT (option-list)
             where the options are:
               A  -- print the "A" register
               number between 0 and 9  -- print that register
               REGS  -- print all registers, 0-9
               ON  -- print A after each succeeding calculation
               OFF  -- suppress printing of A after calculations
               F  -- print current list of learned functions
               'function-name' -- print that learned function.
               Default is PRINT ON.
               'option-list'  -- is one or more options separated by
               blanks or commas

   HELP -  Request instructions on calculator operation. (or use 'H').
           Help may be entered with no operands for general
           information, or with one of the following operands:
             SYNTAX  -- requests syntax information
             COMMANDS -- requests descriptions of all available commands
             FUNCTIONS  -- requests descriptions of all built-in
             (Abbreviations SYN , COM, FUNC)
             subcommand-name  -- requests info. on that command
             ALL -- requests all available information.

   LEARN - Accept and store a series of commands for later execution.
             Syntax is:
             LEARN function-name
               where function-name is a 1 to 8 character name
               by which you will identify the learned function.
           To terminate learn mode, type 'END'.

   ERASE - Erase a previously learned function.
             Syntax is:
             ERASE function-name

   EXECUTE - Execute a learned function.
             Syntax is:
             EXECUTE function-name options
               where function-name is as above and available options are
               'LIST' which prints each line of the function as it is
               executed, and 'n TIMES' which causes the function to be
               executed that many times (n is any positive integer).
               Defaults are 1 times and no listing.
               EXECUTE may be abbreviated as 'EXEC' or 'EX'

   R - Recall a register.
         Syntax is R followed by the register number.
         Note:  R can be used as an operand in an expression,
          for example,  '2+r3'.

   S - Store the latest operand (usually 'A') in a register.
         Syntax is  S followed by a register number./

   # - Request terminal input.  This symbol may be used, in place of any
       arithmetic operand in a learned function.  It signifies that the
       operand will be entered from the terminal during execution (the
       calculator will prompt you for the operand).  In response to the
       prompt you may enter a number or any of the symbols 'A', 'E', or
       'PI'.  Note that '#' is valid only in learned functions and is
       not accepted as normal terminal input.

   A - Use the current accumulator value, e.g.  17*A

   E - The base of natural logarithms, 2.7182818284590452353602874713526

   PI - Trigonometric constant, 3.14159265358979323846264338327950

   FORMAT - Force printing of numbers in a specified format.
            Abbreviation:  FORM.
            Syntax is
              FORMAT(FIXED,n1,n2) to specify fixed point
                representation with n1 digits of which n2 are fractional
              FORMAT(FLOAT,n1)    to specify floating point
                representation with n1 digits
              FORMAT(AUTO)        to specify automatic formatting.
           The default is FORMAT(AUTO).
           FIXED may be abbreviated as 'FX' and FLOAT as "FLT'.


SUMMARY OF AVAILABLE COMMANDS
   Available commands are:
    END, PRINT, HELP, LEARN, ERASE, EXECUTE, FORMAT, R, and S.
   Other symbols which may be used in calculations are 'A', 'E', 'PI',
   and '#'.
   Also, any arithmetic expression using numbers, parentheses, +, -, *,
   /, **, or the builtin functions is valid calculator input.
   For more information on any of these commands or symbols,
   type 'HELP' with the command/symbol as operand.
