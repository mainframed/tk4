This file contains the following members:

$DOC    -  what you are reading
CLIST   -  Copy this member into your clist library as member PREP
           (use this member only if you do not have REXX)
EXEC    -  Copy this member into your REXX exec library as member PREP
MSGS    -  Copy this member into your ISPF messages library as member PR
PANELS  -  Copy this member into your ISPF panels library as member PREP

Both a CLIST and a REXX version are provided of this dialog for those wh
currently do not have REXX installed.  It is also a good comparison of
how to do the same thing in CLIST vs. REXX.

This file contains a much improved approach for using the IBM ISPPREP
utility to preprocess ISPF panels.  It is best installed as an ISPF
command in the ISPCMDS table:

    VERB    T    ACTION
                   Description
    PREP    0    SELECT CMD(%PREP &ZPARM)
                   Preprocessed Panel Utility
