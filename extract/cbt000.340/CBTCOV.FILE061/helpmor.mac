)F FUNCTION -
  The ALLOCMOR command allows you to add an SPF library to the existing
  concatenation, requiring only that you know the ddname to which it is
  to be concatenated.  This command may only execute if SPF is not
  active, that is, in the native TSO environment.
)X SYNTAX -
         ALLOCMOR  ddname  dsname  position
  REQUIRED - ddname  dsname  position
  DEFAULTS - none
)O OPERANDS -
))ddname   - The SPF ddname which is to be associated with your library

))dsname   - The data set name that you want added to the
             concatenation.  It may be specified without quotes if it
             is qualified by your TSO id and the first qualifier is
             omitted, or it can be specified with quotes and be fully
             qualified.  The dataset must exist and be cataloged.  In
             order to allocate more than one dataset, issue this
             command once for each dataset name.  There is a
             restriction that there be no more than 20 datasets
             concatenated to one file (ddname).

))position - Specifies whether the dataset specified by dsname will be
             concatenated first or last.  Valid values for this
             parameter are:
                  FIRST  or  F   to concatenate your library first,
                  LAST   or  L   to concatenate your library last.


))NOTES -
   - DO NOT FREE the DDNAME before using it in ALLOCMOR.

   - Rules regarding dataset concatenation still apply, the dataset
     with the largest blocksize must be first in the concatenation.
