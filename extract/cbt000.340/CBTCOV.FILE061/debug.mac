)F       FUNCTION -
         THE DEBUGGER COMMAND IS A TOOL USED BY SYSTEM PROGRAMMERS
         TO MODIFY AND DISPLAY MAIN MEMORY LOCATIONS. ITS USE IS
         RESTRICTED TO SYSTEM SUPPORT PERSONNEL ONLY.

         CURRENTLY, ONLY THE VIRTUAL ADDRESS SPACE OF THE CALLER IS
         AVAILABLE. BOTH PROTECTED AND UNPROTECTED STORAGE MAY BE
         EXAMINED AND ALTERED.

)X       SYNTAX   -
         DEBUGGER  (TO OBTAIN HELP ABOUT SUBCOMANDS ENTER "HELP" WHEN
                    INSIDE THE DEBUGGER COMMAND)

)O       OPERANDS -
         DEBUGGER HAS NO COMMAND LEVEL OPERANDS

)S       SUBCOMMANDS -
         DEBUGGER SUPPORTS THE FOLLOWING SUBCOMMANDS:

         ASCB,C,CSCB,D,DELETE,END,F,H,HELP,LOAD,
         N,O,S,UCB,X,?C,?N,?T

         TO DISPLAY STORAGE AROUND A GIVEN ADDRESS ENTER
         THE ADDRESS (IN HEX) AROUND WHICH YOU WOULD LIKE
         THE DISPLAY TO BEGIN. A ">" OR "<" WILL MARK THE
         FIRST BYTE OF THE ADDRESS YOU HAVE ENTERED. TO ENTER
         A DECIMAL ADDRESS PLACE A PERIOD (".") AFTER THE
         ADDRESS VALUE. THIS WILL BE INTERPRETED BY DEBUGGER
         TO MEAN A DECIMAL OFFSET FROM LOCATION ZERO INSTEAD
         OF A HEX OFFSET.

         TRACE AND NAME TABLES ARE MAINTAINED FOR VARIOUS
         DISPLAY LOCATIONS. YOU CAN ASSIGN A NAME TO A
         STORAGE LOCATION AND REFER TO IT LATER BY THAT NAME.
         THE TRACE TABLE CAN CONTAIN UP TO 35 ENTRIES AND YOU
         MAY REFER TO THE ENTRIES BY SOME SPECIAL CHARACTERS
         THAT ARE OUTLINED BELOW.

         SPECIFYING AN ADDRESS IN EITHER HEXIDECIMAL OR DECIMAL
         WILL CAUSE DEBUG TO DISPLAY STORAGE AROUND THAT ADDRESS.

         EXAMPLES OF THE SYNTAX OF ADDRESS AND VALUES ARE AS FOLLOWS:
               01234DF   -  HEXIDECIMAL SELF DEFINING TERM
               123456.   -  DECIMAL     SELF DEFINING TERM
               'ABCDEF'  -  CHARACTER   SELF DEFINING TERM

         -- THE VALUE OF <ADDR> AND <VALUE> USED IN THE FOLLOWING
            DISPLAYS IS DETERMINED AS FOLLOWS:
            NUMBERS AND HEX DIGITS ENTERED WITHOUT A TRAILING '.'
            ARE INTERPRETED IN ALL CASES TO BE 'HEX';
            IF FOLLOWED BY A '.', IT IS INTERPRETED TO BE
            'DECIMAL'.

             NOTE: FOR PURPOSES OF STORAGE ALTERING COMMANDS,
             THE LENGTH OF STORAGE TO BE ALTERED IS ALWAYS:
             1+LEN_ENTERED/2 DROPPING ANY REMAINDER FOR HEX,
             4 FOR DECIMAL.
             THE MAXIMUM LENGTH IS:
             8 HEX DIGITS, OR
             AS MUCH AS 1 FULLWORD (DECIMAL)

            FOR PURPOSES OF INTERMEDIATE COMPUTATION, ALL
            VALUES ARE KEPT IN A FULLWORD, WITH HI ORDER BITS
            TRUNCATED AS NECESSARY.
                   (E.G.  D123456789 - WOULD BE INTERPRETED AS
                          D23456789)

            IF THE INPUT FOR AN <ADDR> VALUE IS INVALID,
            I.E. CONTAINS NON-HEX CHARACTERS, IT WILL BE ASSUMED
            TO BE A NAME.  IF IT IS NOT FOUND IN THE NAME TABLE,
            AN ERROR MESSAGE WILL BE DISPLAYED WITH A BAR ('×') UNDER
            THE APPROXIMATE LOCATION OF THE ERROR, IF POSSIBLE.

            <VALUE> INFORMATION MUST BE ENTERED AS A SELF-DEFINING
            TERM IN HEX, OR DECIMAL (FOLLOWED BY A '.').

            NOTE:
             SINCE 'C',AND 'D' ARE COMMANDS, HEX NUMBERS
             BEGINNING WITH THESE VALUES MUST BE SPECIFIED WITH
             A LEADING ZERO. NAMES BEGINNING WITH THESE LETTERS
             SHOULD BE AVOIDED.

         THE FOLLOWING SPECIAL CHARACTERS MAY BE USED AS
         SUBCOMMANDS:

         =         - ASSIGN A NAME TO CURRENT DISPLAY ADDRESS
                     EXAMPLE - =QQ - ASSIGN CURRENT ADDR TO NAME 'QQ'

         %         - INVOKE AN CLIST FROM SYSPROC.
                     EXAMPLE - %CVT - INVOKE 'CVT' EXEC FROM SYSPROC
                     N O T E - 'CONTROL LIST' IN A CLIST WILL NOT HAVE
                               ANY EFFECT.  THE STACK WILL BE FLUSHED
                               AT THE FIRST INVALID COMMAND.

         <         - BACKUP IN DISPLAY TRACE TABLE
                     EXAMPLE - <<< - BACK UP THREE ENTRIES

         >         - FORWARD IN DISPLAY TRACE TABLE
                     EXAMPLE - >>> - GO FORWARD THREE ENTRIES

         +         - ADD TO CURRENT DISPLAY ADDRESS AND DISPLAY
                     EXAMPLE - +40 - ADD X'40' TO CURRENT LOCATION
                               QQ+40 - ADD X'40' TO VALUE OF NAME 'QQ'
                                       AND DISPLAY THAT LOCATION

         -         - SUBTRACT FROM CURRENT DISPLAY ADDRESS AND DISPLAY
                     EXAMPLE - -40 - SUB X'40' FROM CURRENT LOCATION
                               QQ-40 - SUB X'40' FROM VALUE OF NAME 'QQ'
                                       AND DISPLAY THAT LOCATION

         ,         - SEPARATE COMMANDS
                     EXAMPLE - 10,F,F,+4,F - FINDS CURRENT TCB
                     N O T E - ',' CANNOT BE USED ON THE SAME INPUT
                               LINE AS A '%' INVOCATION OF A CLIST.

         *         - REDISPLAY CURRENT CORE ADDRESS

         (BLANKS)  - SAME AS '*'

         X SPACE   - P.C.F. TRANSFER TO OTHER TSO COMMAND
                     EXAMPLE - X MS - INVOKE ''MS'' COMMAND.
                     N O T E - WHEN YOU "X" TO ANOTHER COMMAND,
                               THE COMMAND WILL GAIN CONTROL IN AN
                               UNAUTHORIZED MODE. THEREFORE YOU CANNOT
                               TRANSFER TO APF AUTHORIZED COMMANDS
                               AND EXPECT TO KEEP YOUR AUTHORIZATION.
                               AUTHORIZATION WILL BE REINSTATED UPON
                               RETURN TO DEBUGGER.
