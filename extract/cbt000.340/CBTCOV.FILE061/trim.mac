)F            FUNCTION

              THE TRIM AND TRIMNP COMMANDS ALLOW A USER TO RELEASE
              UNUSED SPACE FROM TSO DATA SETS. THE USER CAN RELEASE
              ALL, OR OPTIONALLY, A PART OF, THE UNUSED SPACE IN ONE
              OR MORE DATA SETS.

              THE TRIMNP COMMAND WILL ACCEPT THE SAME OPERANDS AS TRIM
              AND FUNCTION EXACTLY THE SAME. THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT
              TRIMNP WILL SUPPRESS THE PRINTING OF ALL MESSAGES.

              THE TRIM COMMAND WILL ACCEPT A PATTERN NAME, ALLOWING
              THE USER TO RELEASE SPACE FROM ALL DATA SETS CONFORMING
              TO A PARTICULAR NAMING STRUCTURE.

              SPACE MAY BE RELEASED ONLY FROM DATA SETS HAVING EITHER
              PHYSICAL SEQUENTIAL (PS) OR PARTITIONED (PO) ORGANIZATION.

                         SPACE (KEEP(0)).

              NOTE     - THE DSNAME VALUE MAY CONTAIN AN * OR @ IN
                         ANY INDEX LEVEL, EXCEPT FOR THE FIRST LEVEL
                         WHEN QUALIFIED DATA SET NAMES ARE SPECIFIED.
                         THE USE OF THE * INDICATES THAT ALL NAMES AT
                         THIS LEVEL ARE REQUESTED. THE @ INDICATES ALL
                         NAMES AT AND BELOW THIS LEVEL.

)O            OPERANDS

))DSLIST         - SPECIFIES THE NAMES OF THE DATA SETS FOR WHICH THE
                   UNUSED SPACE IS TO BE RELEASED.

))SPACE(TRACKS)  - SPECIFIES THE AMOUNT OF UNUSED SPACE, IN TRACKS,
))LEAVE(TRACKS)    WHICH IS NOT TO BE RELEASED. IF THIS OPERAND IS
))KEEP (TRACKS)    NOT SPECIFIED, THEN ALL UNUSED SPACE IN THE DATA
))SAVE (TRACKS)    SET IS RELEASED.

  EXAMPLE:         TRIM *  OR TRIMNP *

                   WILL RELEASE ALL UNUSED SPACE FROM ALL SINGLE LEVEL
                   DATA SETS FOR YOUR USER I.D. (E.G. ASM, CNTL, LOAD)

                   TRIM TEST.@  OR TRIMNP TEST.@

                   WILL RELEASE ALL UNUSED SPACE FROM ALL DATA SETS
                   BEGINNING WITH USERID.TEST
