)F  FUNCTION
  THIS IS NOT A COMMAND, BUT IS A LIST (AND EXPLANATION) OF ERROR CODES
  WHICH MAY OCCUR DURING A TSO SESSION.  THESE ERRORS ARE ALL RELATED
  TO DYNAMIC ALLOCATION PROBLEMS AND MAY OCCUR WHEN USING ALLOCATE,
  FREE, EDIT, COPY, ETC.  DO NOT CONFUSE THESE ERRORS WITH SYSTEM
  ERRORS AND ABENDS.
)X SYNTAX -
  THERE IS NO SYNTAX AS SUCH FOR ERROR.  IT IS INTENDED FOR USE WITH
  THE HELP COMMAND (EG., HELP ERROR OR HELP ERROR O(4)  ).
)O OPERANDS
  THE OPERANDS OF ERROR ARE THE SPECIFIC ERROR CODES IN QUESTION (SEE
  HINTS).
))HINTS -
         IF AN ERROR CODE BEGINS WITH A LEADING ZERO, THE ZERO SHOULD
         NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE OPERAND.  ERROR CODES NORMALLY APPEAR
         AS SECOND LEVEL MESSAGES.

         EXAMPLE A:
             THE DYNAMIC ALLOCATION ERROR CODE 042 HAS BEEN RECEIVED.
             TO OBTAIN INFORMATION CONCERNING THIS ERROR, ENTER:
                 HELP ERROR O(42)
