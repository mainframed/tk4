)F FUNCTION -
  The REVIEW command allows a dataset to be examined at a 3270
  terminal in full screen mode.  Since this command can display
  a temporary dataset (using the 'FILE' keyword), it may be useful
  when other commands can not be used.

)X SYNTAX  -
         REVIEW  <DSNAME>  UNIT(<UNIT>)  VOLUME(<VOLUME>)
     OR
         REVIEW  <FILENAME>  FILE
  Required - <DSNAME> or <FILENAME>
  Defaults - None
  Alias    - REV
)O OPERANDS -
  <DSNAME(MEMBER)> The dataset to be examined.
  <FILENAME> - The DDNAME allocated to the dataset to be examined.
  The first operand is assumed to be a DSNAME unless it is followed
  by the keyword 'FILE'.
))FILE     - This keyword indicates that the first operand is
             a filename, not a DSNAME.  This is useful for looking
             at a temporary dataset.
))VOLUME('VOLUME') - For uncataloged datasets, the volume serial.
))UNIT('UNIT') - For uncataloged datasets, the unit type.  This can
             be omitted if your session default unit is appropriate.
             This operand is ignored if VOLUME is not specified.
))PFK      - This is not an operand, but a description of
             the Program Function Keys used by this command.
             PFK1  -         PFK2  -            PFK3  - END
             PFK4  -         PFK5  - FIND       PFK6  - HEX
             PFK7  - UP      PFK8  - DOWN       PFK9  - TOP
             PFK10 - LEFT    PFK11 - RIGHT      PFK12 - BOTTOM
             These can be changed using the PFKn subcommand, but
             the changes are in effect only until the command ends.
             Example: 'PFK6 RIGHT 1' would make PFK6 'RIGHT 1'.
))SUBCOMMANDS - This is not an operand, but a list of the
             subcommands that can be entered on the screen.
    UP     - Scroll backwards a specified number of records.
             If no operand is specified, the 'RANGE' value is
             used.  This is displayed in the upper right corner.
    '-'    - Same as 'UP'.
    DOWN   - Scroll backwards a specified number of records.
             If no operand is specified, the 'RANGE' value is
             used.  This is displayed in the upper right corner.
    '+'    - Same as 'DOWN'
    LEFT   - Scroll to the left a specified number of columns.
             If no operand is specified, 80 is used.
    '<'    - Same as 'LEFT'
    RIGHT  - Scroll to the right a specified number of columns.
             If no operand is specified, 80 is used.
    '>'    - Same as 'RIGHT'
    TOP    - Scroll up to the first record.
    BOTTOM - Scroll down to the last record.
    BOT    - Same as 'BOTTOM'.
    LIST   - Display the specified record number.
             Relative record number only, not sequence numbers.
    HEX ON - Display the screen in hexadecimal.
    HEX OFF - Display the screen in EBCDIC.
    HEX     - If HEX currently ON, turn it off.  If OFF, turn it ON.
    FIND   - Search forward until the specified string is found.
             String does not have to be in quotes unless it contains
             one or more imbedded blanks.
             String may be followed by a column number.
             If no operand, string from previous FIND is used.
    CAPS   - Display lower case data in caps.
    ASIS   - Display lower case data in lower case.
    MEMBER - Switch to a specified member within the same
             Partitioned dataset as the current member.
    PFKn   - Set Program Function Key 'n'.
    SMF ON - If SMF data is being examined, convert the record
             type, date, and time to understandable format.
    SMF OFF - Undo SMF ON.
    SMF     - If SMF currently ON, turn it OFF. If OFF, turn it ON.
    END    - End the command.
