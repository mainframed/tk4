)F FUNCTION -
     TASKLIB is a TSO command processor which allows the invocation
  of another command processor or procedure with the specification
  of a task library.  This is somewhat like being able to 'CALL' a
  command processor.  (Note that the library is not in effect during
  the execution of a command procedure, but only during the building
  of it.)
)X SYNTAX -
     TASKLIB  <FILE>  <COMMAND>  <OPERANDS>

  REQUIRED - <FILE>, <COMMAND>
  DEFAULT  - None
  ALIAS    - CP
  NOTE     - If the command is invoked by the alias 'CP', the <FILE>
             operand is not present ('SYSCP' is assumed) (the first
             operand is <COMMAND>)
)O OPERANDS -
))<FILE> - A filename to be opened as a task library (it should
           already be completely allocated -- we use a file instead
           of a dataset name to give us a concatenated ability);  if
           this operand is specified as '*,' no task library will be
           used.  Note: if the command is invoked by the alias 'CP',
           the <FILE> operand is not present ('SYSCP' is assumed)
           (the first operand is <COMMAND>).

))<COMMAND> - The invoking command of the CP to be executed under
              the task library;

))<OPERANDS> - Whatever the <COMMAND> processor wants.
