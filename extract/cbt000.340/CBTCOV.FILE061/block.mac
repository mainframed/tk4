  IS TO RESIDE ON A 3330 OR 3350 DISK DEVICE.
)X SYNTAX -
         BLOCK LRECL MIN(NNN) MAX(NNN) PC(NN) B3330 B3350

  REQUIRED - LRECL
  DEFAULTS - NO ADDITIONAL PARAMETERS
  ALIAS - BLK

)O OPERANDS -

  'LRECL'- THIS IS THE LOGICAL RECORD LENGTH FOR THE
             FILE IN QUESTION.

  'MIN(NNN)' - "NNN" DESIGNATES THE MINIMUM BLOCKSIZE
             WHICH IS ACCEPTABLE FOR THIS FILE.  IF "MIN"
             IS NOT SPECIFIED, NO MINIMUM IS ASSUMED.

  'MAX(NNN)' - "NNN" DESIGNATES THE MAXIMUM BLOCKSIZE
             WHICH IS ACCEPTABLE FOR THIS FILE.  IF "MAX" IS
             NOT SPECIFIED, TRACK SIZE FOR THE DEVICE IS
             ASSUMED.

  'PC(NN)'   - "NN" SPECIFIES THE PERCENT OF TRACK
             UTILIZATION DESIRED.  IF "PC" IS NOT SPECIFIED,
             THE DESIRED TRACK UTILIZATION DEFAULTS TO 90%.
