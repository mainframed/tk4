)F  FUNCTION -
  THE STATUS COMMAND IS USED TO FIND THE STATUS OF JOBS
  PREVIOUSLY SUBMITTED TO THE BACKGROUND EITHER THROUGH
  TSO OR A CARD OR INTERNAL READER. THE STATUS OF STARTED
  TASKS AND TSO USERS MAY ALSO BE LISTED.

  STATUS WILL SEARCH FOR JOB BY USING THE CHARACTERS YOU
  SUPPLY IN THE JOBLIST. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU ONLY ASKED FOR
  THE STATUS OF JOB 'A', THEN STATUS WOULD RETURN TO YOUR
  TERMINAL THE STATUS OF ALL THE JOBS WHOSE JOBNAMES BEGIN
  WITH THE CHARACTER 'A'.

  STATUS MAY ALSO BE RUN UNDER THE TSO TMP IN BATCH MODE,
  HOWEVER THE 'JOBLIST' OPERAND MUST BE ENTERED IN THIS MODE
  BECAUSE WHEN RUNNING THE TSO TMP IN BATCH, NO USERID IS
  ASSOCIATED WITH THE JOB.

  STATUS MAY BE USED WITH AN ALTERNATE JES2 SUBSYSTEM. IN
  THAT CASE, THE 'JOBLIST' OPERAND MUST BE ENTERED RATHER
  THAT LETTING YOUR USERID BE SUPPLIED BY DEFAULT.

)X SYNTAX  -
        STATUS    (JOBLIST) 'SUBSYSTEM NAME'
  REQUIRED - NONE

  DEFAULTS - IF NO (JOBLIST) IS GIVEN, STATUS WILL
             SEARCH THE QUEUES FOR JOBS BEGINNING WITH

             ENTRY, STATUS WILL RETURN STATUS FOR JOBS
             BEGINNING WITH THE CHARACTERS ENTERED. IF
             A SUBSYSTEM NAME IS SUPPLIED, THEN A JOBLIST
             MUST BE SUPPLIED. IT WILL NOT DEFAULT TO YOUR
             USERID IN THAT CASE.

             IF NO 'SUBSYSTEM NAME' IS GIVEN THE STATUS WILL
             SEARCH THE QUEUES OF THE SUBSYSTEM NAMED 'JES2'.
             OTHERWISE THE QUEUES OF THE ALTERNATE JES2 WILL
             BE SEARCHED.
