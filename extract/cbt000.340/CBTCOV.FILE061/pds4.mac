 SUBCOMMANDS - ALIAS, ATTR, CHANGE, DISPLAY, END, HISTORY, LIST,
               MAP, OPTIONS, PACK, RENAME, SCRATCH, AND USAGE.
)F FUNCTION -
               THE PDS3 COMMAND ALLOWS THE TSO USER TO
               ACCESS AND MANIPULATE THE DIRECTORY AND
               SELECTED MEMBERS OF A PARTITIONED DATA SET.

               THE PDS3 COMMAND PROVIDES OPTIONS TO DISPLAY THE
               DIRECTORY, SCRATCH, RENAME AND CREATE ALIASES
               FOR SELECTED MEMBERS, TO DISPLAY AND UPDATE
               THE ATTRIBUTES OF LOAD MODULES, AND TO PRODUCE
               A BRIEF MODULE MAP AND HISTORY SUMMARY FOR
               SELECTED LOAD MODULES.

               THE PDS3 COMMAND ALSO ALLOWS THE USER TO EXECUTE
               ANY TSO COMMAND PROCESSOR WITHOUT LEAVING PDS3.
               IT ALLOWS THE USER TO ENTER HELP, ALLOCATE, FREE,
               EXEC, AND SEND AS TRUE SUBCOMMANDS, AND THE OTHER
               COMMAND PROCESSORS AS COMMANDS.

               PDS3 ALSO ALLOWS THE USER TO ENTER THE NAME OF A
               UTILITY AND AN OPTIONAL PARM (WITHIN QUOTES) AND
               THE UTILITY WILL BE INVOKED.  THE UTILITIES ALLOWED
               ARE: AMASPZAP, IMASPZAP, IEBCOPY (MUST BE AUTHORIZED
               LOGON STILL), IEBUPDTE, IEBPTPCH, IEHPROGM, IEHPROGA,
               IEHLIST, AND IEHMOVE.  PDS3 WILL, FOR SELECTED
               UTILITIES, INFORM THEM THAT THEY SHOULD USE THE
               DATASET CURRENTLY UNDER INSPECTION.  THE FOLLOWING
               UTILITIES FALL IN THIS CLASS: AMASPZAP, IMASPZAP,
               IEBCOPY (SYSUT1 & SYSUT2), AND IEBPTPCH (SYSUT1).
