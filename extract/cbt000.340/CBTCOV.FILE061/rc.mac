)F FUNCTION -
     The RC command displays the return code from a previously issued
     command.  This is of particular value after using a command that
     appears to have ended normally.  A call to a compiler, as an
     example, will end with a 'READY' from TSO when, in fact, the
     compiler has set a non-zero return code to indicate an
     unsuccessful compile.  The RC command will display the return
     code which actually reflects the results of the compilation.

     Warning.....

     The RC command will reset an ABEND condition because it will be
     the last successfully completed command.  If the 'TEST' command
     is to be used the ABEND will have to be re-created.
