    DESCRIPTION:  STATS FORMATS INFORMATION ON ANY DISK DATA
         SET.  IT READS THROUGH THE ENTIRE DATA SET AND OUTPUTS DISK
         TRACK USAGE, BLOCKSIZE AND OTHER STATISTICS.


    OPERATION:
        A.  THE PROGRAM GETS THE INPUT DATA SET NAME AND VOLUME SERIAL
            NUMBER VIA "RDJFCB".

        B.  THE PROGRAM INPUTS THE FORMAT 1 DSCB TO DETERMINE OTHER
            DATA SET CHARACTERISTICS.

        C.  THE PROGRAM OPENS THE INPUT FILE, THEN FORMATS AND
            OUTPUTS DEB AND DSCB INFORMATION.

        D.  IF A PARM OF "LABEL" IS NOT CODED, THE PROGRAM READS
            EACH BLOCK OF DATA IN THE DATA SET AND COLLECTS RECORD
            COUNTS, RECORD SIZE AND TRACK USEAGE STATISTICS.

        E.  ADDITIONAL PROCESSING:

            1. FOR DSORG=PS, NONE.

            2. FOR DSORG=DA, NONE.

            3. FOR DSORG=IS, THE PROGRAM READS THROUGH THE ENTIRE
               DATA SET (THERE MAY BE UP TO THREE SEPARATE FILES OF
               DATA AND REPORTS ON EACH FILE.  ALSO, THE PROGRAM
               INPUTS THE ISAM LABEL (FORMAT TWO DSCB) RECORD AND
               PROVIDES A DATA SET PROFILE WHICH INCLUDES DATA SET
               REORGAINIZATION DATA AND DATA SET CHARACTERISTICS.

            4. FOR DSORG=PO, THE PROGRAM COMPARES DIRECTORY TTR'S
               AGAINST ACTUAL DISK ADDRESSES TO DETERMINE THE TTRS
               OF "GAS" MEMBERS (THE PROGRAM ALSO OUTPUTS THE FIRST
               79 CHARACTERS OF ANY GAS MEMBER).  STATISTICS ARE
               MAINTAINED ON THE SIZE OF GAS AND REAL MEMBERS AND
               THE NUMBER OF ALIAS MEMBERS.
               IF ANY ALIASES ARE IN THE DATA SET, A CHECK IS MADE
               TO SEE THAT CORRESPONDING REAL ENTRIES ALSO EXIST.
               NOTE: A PARM OF 'NO' WILL NULLIFY THE GAS TTR REPORT.
