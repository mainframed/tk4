)F FUNCTION -
   THE PRINTOFF COMMAND CAN BE USED TO OBTAIN HARDCOPY
   OF DATA SETS THROUGH FOREGROUND COPYING TO SYSOUT.
   THE COMMAND PRINTS A DATASET(S) WHICH IS SEQUENTIAL
   OR PARTITIONED, BLOCKED OR UNBLOCKED, WITH FIXED,
   VARIABLE, OR UNDEFINED LENGTH RECORDS OF ANY LENGTH
   UP TO A FULL TRACK.

                 OCCURED. RETURN CODES ARE LISTED BELOW:

                 RC=00 - NORMAL RETURN - NO ERRORS HAVE OCCURED

                 RC=20 - DATASET NOT PRINTED DUE TO ERROR
                 RC=24 - SYNAD ROUTINE ENTERED (SEE SYSTEMS SUPPORT)

)O OPERANDS -
))'DSLIST'  - 'DATA SET LIST' CONTAINS THE NAMES OF DATA SETS
            TO BE PRINTED OR PUNCHED.  THE NAMES SHOULD FOLLOW
            TSO CONVENTION,  IN QUOTES IF THE PRIMARY INDEX
            DIFFERS FROM YOUR USERID, OR WITHOUT QUOTES AND
            WITH THE PRIMARY INDEX OMITTED IF IT IS THE SAME
            AS YOUR USERID.
))CLASS('CLASS') - SYSOUT CLASS IN WHICH OUTPUT IS TO BE
            PRINTED.  DEFAULT IS A.
))COPIES('NNN') - NUMBER OF COPIES TO BE PRINTED.
            DEFAULT IS 1.
))DEST('REMOTE') - REMOTE LOCATION TO WHICH SYSOUT DATA SETS
            ARE TO BE ROUTED.
))HOLD      - OUTPUT IS TO BE PLACED ON A HOLD QUEUE UPON
            DEALLOCATION.
))NOHOLD    - OUTPUT IS NOT TO BE PLACED ON A HOLD QUEUE
            UPON DEALLOCATION.
))LIST      - MEMBER NAMES ARE ONLY TO BE LISTED UNLESS
            PRINT IS EXPLICITLY STATED.
))NOLIST    - MEMBER NAMES ARE NOT TO BE LISTED (ONLY
            PRINTED UNLESS NOPRINT IS EXPLICITLY STATED).
))PRINT     - MEMBERS ARE ONLY TO BE PRINTED (NOT LISTED
            UNLESS LIST IS EXPLICITLY STATED).
))NOPRINT   - MEMBERS ARE NOT TO BE PRINTED (ONLY LISTED
            UNLESS NOLIST IS EXPLICITLY STATED).
))FORMS('FORM')  - FORM TO BE USED WHEN THE DATA SET IS PRINTED.
                  (1-4 CHARACTER FORM NAME)
))FCB('IMAGE')   - THE FORMS CONTROL BUFFER LOAD IMAGE TO BE USED
             TO PRINT THE DATA SET.
                  (1-4 CHARACTER FCB IMAGE NAME)
))UCS('IMAGE')   - PRINT IMAGE TO BE USED WHEN PRINTED.
            THIS IS OFTEN CALLED THE TRAIN.
            (1-4 CHARACTER PRINT IMAGE NAME)
))TRAIN('IMAGE') - CHARACTER SET TO BE USED WHEN PRINTING DATA SET
            THIS IS AN ALIAS TO THE 'UCS' KEYWORD.
            (1-4 CHARACTER IMAGE NAME TO BE USED AS A CHARACTER SET)
))CHARS('IMAGE') - CHARACTER SET TO BE USED WHEN PRINTING DATA SET
            THIS IS AN ALIAS TO THE 'UCS' KEYWORD.
            (1-4 CHARACTER IMAGE NAME TO BE USED AS A CHARACTER SET)
))HEADING     - OUTPUT IS TO HAVE HEADING INFORMATION.
                THIS CONTAINS THE DATASET NAME.
))NOHEADING   - OUTPUT IS NOT HAVE HEADING INFORMATION.
))SS        - OUTPUT IS TO BE SINGLE SPACED BETWEEN LINES
))DS        - OUTPUT IS TO BE DOUBLE SPACED BETWEEN LINES
            (MULTIPLE LINE RECORDS WILL NOT BE SPLIT BETWEEN PAGES)
))CAPS      - OUTPUT IS TO BE CONVERTED TO UPPER CASE
            PRIOR TO PRINTING.
))ASIS      - OUTPUT IS NOT TO BE CONVERTED TO UPPER CASE
            PRIOR TO PRINTING.(IT IS LEFT AS IT IS)
))TEXT      - OUTPUT IS CONSIDERED TO BE TEXT. THIS OPERAND CHANGES
            CHANGES DEFAULTS TO BE ASIS CHARS(T11)
))LINELENGTH=LL('NNN') - NUMBER OF CHARACTERS ON EACH LINE OF
            PRINTED OUTPUT BETWEEN 1 AND 132 CHARACTERS WITH A DEFAULT
            OF 131.  LINES LONGER THAN SPECIFIED LINELENGTH WILL
            BE PRINTED ON MULTIPLE LINES.
))PAGELENGTH=PL('NN') - NUMBER OF LINES PER PAGE, BETWEEN 1 AND 120
            LINES WITH A DEFAULT OF 60.
))VOLUME('VOLSER') - VOLUME SERIAL OF VOLUME ON WHICH DATA SETS
            TO BE PRINTED ARE FOUND.  THIS VOLUME SERIAL
            WILL BE USED FOR ALL DATA SETS SPECIFIED IN
            THE DATA SET LIST.
))ASA       - SPECIFIES THAT 'PRINTOFF' IS TO CONSIDER THE FIRST
            CHARACTER OF THE INPUT DATASET AS A PRINTER CONTROL
            CHARACTER EVEN THOUGH THE DATA SET LABEL DOES NOT
            SPECIFY PRINTER CONTROL CHARACTERS. USEFUL WHEN PRINTING
            A SINGLE MEMBER FROM A PDS THAT IS NOT DEFINED AS HAVING
            PRINT CONTROL CHARACTERS.
))NOMSG     - SPECIFIES THAT INFORMATIVE, DATA, AND ERROR MESSAGES
            ARE NOT TO BE PRINTED AT THE TERMINAL. SUCCESSFUL
            EXECUTION OF 'PRINTOFF' CAN BE DETERMINED BY THE
            PRESENCE OF A ZERO RETURN CODE. THE RETURN CODE WILL BE
            NON-ZERO IF ANY KIND OF ERROR OCCURS.
