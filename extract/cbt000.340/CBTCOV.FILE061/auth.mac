)F       THE AUTH COMMAND CAN BE USED IN PLACE OF THE CALL COMMAND
         FOR PROGRAMS THAT ARE IN THE LINK LIST DATA SETS OR LPALIB;
         THIS INCLUDES ALL COMPILERS AND UTILITIES.

         NOTE: THE 'AUTH' COMMAND IS APF AUTHORIZED AND WILL CALL
               YOUR LINKLIST/LPA MODULE AS AUTHORIZED. IF YOU
               ATTEMPT TO CALL A MODULE OF THE SAME NAME FROM
               AN UNAUTHORIZED STEPLIB, YOU WILL BE ABENDED.
               USE THE 'XEQ' OR '#' ALIASES IF YOU WISH TO
               NOT BE AUTHORIZED. THE 'AUTH' COMMAND USAGE IS
               RESTRICTED TO MEMBERS OF SUPPORT GROUPS ONLY.
               APPLICATION PROGRAMMERS MAY ONLY USE THE '#'
               OR 'XEQ' ENTRY POINTS.

         ADVANTAGES OF THE AUTH COMMAND OVER CALL COMMAND:
         1) THE AUTH COMMAND REQUIRES NO DYNAMIC DD CARD NOR
            ALLOCATION AND IS, THEREFORE, CONSIDERABLY FASTER;
         2) THE AUTH COMMAND SIMPLIFIES SYNTAX AND REQUIRES
            LESS TYPING;
         3) THE AUTH COMMAND ALLOWS USE OF PROGRAMS IN ANY OF
            THE LINKLIB DATA SETS, WITHOUT KNOWING WHICH OF THE
            DATA SETS THE PROGRAM IS IN.
         4) THE AUTH COMMAND SEARCHES THE LPA QUEUE BEFORE THE
            LINKLIST, SO IT CAN EXECUTE PROGRAMS IN THE LPA
            THAT ARE NOT ALSO IN THE LINKLIST.

         DISADVANTAGES OF THE AUTH COMMAND:
         THE ONLY DISADVANTAGE OF THE AUTH COMMAND IS THAT
         THE PROGRAM BEING CALLED MUST BE IN A LINKLIB DATA SET;
         HENCE, TO CALL A USER'S PROGRAM FROM HIS LIBRARY, THE
         CALL COMMAND MUST STILL BE USED.
)X       THE SYNTAX OF THE AUTH COMMAND IS AS FOLLOWS:
         AUTH PROGRAM 'PARM'
         WHERE PROGRAM IS THE NAME OF THE PROGRAM TO BE EXECUTED AND
         'PARM' IS AN OPTIONAL PARM FIELD OF UP TO 100 CHARACTERS
         WHICH IS TO BE PASSED TO THE PROGRAM.
)O       THE OPERANDS OF THE AUTH COMMAND ARE:
         PROGRAM - THE 1 TO 8 CHARACTER NAME OF THE PROGRAM TO BE
                   EXECUTED.
         'PARM'  - THE OPTIONAL 0 TO 100 CHARACTER STRING, ENCLOSED IN
                   QUOTES, REPRESENTING THE PARAMETER TO BE PASSED TO
                   THE PROGRAM.

         EXAMPLE - INVOKING IEHLIST.  SYSPRINT AND SYSIN MUST BE
                   PREVIOUSLY ALLOCATED.

                   AUTH IEHLIST

         EXAMPLE - INVOKING ASSEMBLER F WITH PARMS OF TEST AND RENT

                   AUTH IEUASM 'TEST,RENT'
