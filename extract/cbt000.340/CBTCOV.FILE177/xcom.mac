XCOM - FPC CROSS MEMORY MESSAGE SWITHCING FACILITY AS OF 01/14/80

  THIS FACILITY ALLOWS ANY PROGRAM IN ANY ADDRESS SPACE TO SEND AND
  RECEIVE MESSAGES FROM ANY OTHER PROGRAM USING ANY NUMBER OF
  LOGICAL PATHS. EACH PROGRAM CAN POST THE OTHER ONE WHEN A
  MESSAGE IS READY.

  THE FACILITY WAS DEVELOPED TO ALLOW THE FPC TROUBLE ANALYSIS
  SYSTEM TO RUN IN A SEPARATE ADDRESS SPACE AND INTERFACE
  WITH CICS.  WITH THIS FACILITY, TROUBLE ANALYSIS CAN NOW
  INTERFACE WITH CICS PLUS TCAM, MCS, AND NOW ALSO TSO
  (ALL IN PARALLEL).

)F FUNCTION -
   THE XCOM COMMAND ALLOWS ANY AUTHORIZED TSO USER TO SEND AND RECEIVE
   MESSAGES TO ANY TSO USER, BATCH PROGRAM, OR ONLINE SYSTEM WHICH HAS
   DEFINED AN XCOM PATH.  THE CURRENTLY DEFINED XCOM PATHS ARE AS
   FOLLOWS

      CAMP - CUSTOMER SERVICE ONLINE SYSTEM (TC004ROP)

      TBLA - TROUBLE ANALYSIS ONLINE SYSTEM (TC005ROP)

      XNNN - TSO USER NNN

   TO USE THE FIRST TWO PATHS ABOVE FOR INQUIRY AND/OR LIVE DATA
   ENTRY REQUIRES SPECIFIC AUTHORIZATION (SEE STAFF SERVICES).

   ANY NUMBER OF TSO USERS CAN USE THE FACILITY IN PARALLEL.
   FOR MORE INFORMATION, THE XCOM DRIVER CONTAINS A HELP
   SUBCOMMAND.  THE DRIVER ALSO SUPPORTS OTHER SUBCOMMANDS
   TO CREATE A HARDCOPY LOG OF ALL INPUT AND OUTPUT MESSAGES,
   TO SWITCH XCOM PATHS, AND TO LIST CURRENT XCOM USERS.

)X SYNTAX -
          XCOM   'PATH'
          DEFAULT  - NONE
          REQUIRED - 4 CHARACTER NAME OF PATH OVER WHICH YOU
                     WISH TO SEND AND RECEIVE MESSAGES
)O OPERANDS -
     PATH   - THIS OPERAND IS NCESSARY AND MUST BE 4 CHARACTER
