)F FUNCTION-
  THE PANDIR COMMAND IS USED TO LIST INFORMATION ABOUT DATA
  STORED IN A PANVALET LIBRARY.  THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IS
  SIMILAR TO THAT PROVIDED BY THE NORMAL LIBRARY DIRECTORY
  LISTING PROGRAMS USED BY THE PROGRAM LIBRARIAN.  IT IS ALSO
  POSSIBLE TO PLACE THE INFORMATION IN A DATASET FOR LATER
  MANIPULATION.
)X SYNTAX-
  PANDIR  'PAN-DATASET'/*  LIBRARY('PAN-LIBRARY')
          DATASET('DATASET'/*)
          COMMENT/NOCOMMENT

 REQUIRED -
 DEFAULTS - LIBRARY('FPC.WORK')
            DATASET(*)
            NOCOMMENT
 EXAMPLES -
   1) LIST INFO ON ALL DATASETS STARTING WITH THE STRING CA3
      ON 'FPC.WORK'.

       PANDIR CA3

   2) LIST INFO ON DATASET GU987000 LOCATED ON 'FPC.SOURCE'.

       PANDIR GU987000 LIB('FPC.SOURCE')

   3) LIST INFO ON ALL DATASETS STARTING WITH THE STRING DD2
      ON 'FPC.PROCLIB'.

       PANDIR DD2 LIB('FPC.PROCLIB')

   4) CREATE AN OS DATASET WITH INFORMATION ON ALL PAN-DATASETS
      STARTING WITH THE STRING MM ON 'FPC.PROCLIB'.  THE DEFAULT
      DATASET NAME OF PANDIR.DATA WILL BE USED.

       PANDIR MM LIB('FPC.PROCLIB') DATASET

      TO PLACE THE RECORDS IN A DIFFERENT NAMED DATASET SUCH AS
      MMDIR  USE:

       PANDIR MM LIB('FPC.PROCLIB') DA(MMDIR)

)O OPERANDS-
  'PAN-DSNAME' - THE NAME OF THE PANVALET DATASET FOR WHICH YOU
                 NEED INFORMATION.  THIS MAY BE THE ENTIRE NAME
                 OR A PREFIX.  FOR EXAMPLE GU9 WILL LIST INFORMATION
                 ABOUT ALL DATASETS WHICH BEGIN WITH THE STRING
                 GU9.  AN ASTERISK MAY BE SPECIFIED WHICH WILL
                 LIST ENTRIES FOR THE ENTIRE LIBRARY.

))LIBRARY('PAN-LIBRARY')
               - THE NAME OF THE PANVALET LIBRARY TO BE REFERENCED
                 TO OBTAIN THE REQUESTED INFORMATION.

))DATASET('DATASET'/*)
               - THE NAME OF THE DATASET TO RECEIVE A CARD IMAGE
                 FOR EACH PAN-DSNAME REQUESTED. IF NOT EXISTENT,
                 A NEW DATASET IS CREATED WITH THE NAME SPECIFIED;
                 IF EXISTENT, THE DATA SET IS REUSED WITH ITS
                 ESTABLISHED ATTRIBUTES.  BEWARE OF VARIABLE
                 LENGTH DATASETS AS THEY WILL BE DESTROYED.
                 IF THE DATASET IS EXISTENT AND IT IS A PDS
                 AND NO MEMBER NAME WAS SPECIFIED THEN THE STRING
                 PANDIR IS USED AS THE MEMBER NAME.  IF THE
                 THE MEMBER NAME IS SPECIFIED IT WILL BE USED
                 TO CREATE A NEW MEMBER OR REUSE AN EXISTING
                 ONE DEPENDING ON ITS PREVIOUS EXISTENCE.
                 IF A MEMBER NAME IS SPECIFIED FOR A NEW
                 DATASET THEN THE DATASET WILL BE PARTITIONED.

               - IF NO DATASET NAME IS SPECIFIED NOR AN ASTERISK
                 IS ENTERED A DATASET NAMED  PANDIR.DATA WILL
                 BE CREATED OR REUSED DEPENDING ON ITS PREVIOUS
                 EXISTENCE.

               - IF AN ASTERISK IS SPECIFIED THE INFORMATION WILL
                 BE FORMATTED ONTO THE TERMINAL.  THIS IS THE
                 DEFAULT.
))COMMENT
               - THE OPTION SPECIFIES THAT COMMENT RECORDS WILL
                 FORMATTED ONTO THE TERMINAL FOR THOSE PAN-DATASETS
                 WHICH HAVE COMMENT RECORDS.
))NOCOMMENT
               - THIS KEYWORD INHIBITS THE LISTING OF COMMENT
                 RECORDS.  IT IS THE DEFAULT AND SHOULD BE
                 USED UNLESS COMMENT RECORDS ARE AVAILABLE.
