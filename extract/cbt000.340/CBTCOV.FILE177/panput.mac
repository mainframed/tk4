)F FUNCTION -
  THE PANPUT COMMAND IS USED TO TRANSFER THE CONTENTS OF A TSO
  DATASET TO A PANVALET LIBRARY.  THE FORMAT IS RESTRICTED TO
  80 BYTE CARD IMAGES.  SPECIAL FEATURES OF THE PANPUT COMMAND
  ENABLE IT TO BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH PANGET TO RETRIEVE
  MEMBERS FROM FPC.SOURCE, UPDATE THEM WITH QED, AND STORE THEM
  IN FPC.WORK MAINTANING SYNCRONIZATION BETWEEN THE LIBRARIES.

)X SYNTAX -
  PANPUT 'PAN-DSNAME'/*  LIBRARY('PAN-LIBNAME')
         DATASET('TSO-DSNAME')
         UPDATE/ADD('TYPE')
         CONTROL/NOCONTROL

  REQUIRED - PAN-DSNAME OR *
  DEFAULTS - LIBRARY('FPC.WORK')
             DATASET(PAN-DSNAME + QUAL)
             UPDATE
             NOCONTROL
  NOTES-
    THE TSO DATASET NAME USED IF NOT SPECIFIED IS A CONCATINATION
    OF THE PAN-DSNAME AND THE VALID QUALIFIER.  FOR EXAMPLE IF
    THE PAN-DSNAME IS ZX103000 AND IT IS A COBOL DATASET, THEN A
    TSO DATASET WITH THE NAME ZX103000.COBOL WILL BE ALLOCATED
    TO PROVIDE THE INPUT.
  EXAMPLES -
    1) PLACE A MEMBER PREVIOUSLY RETRIEVED FROM 'FPC.SOURCE' WITH
       PANGET INTO 'FPC.WORK'.  THE PANGET COMMAND USED WAS
         PANGET ZX105000 LIB('FPC.SOURCE')
       THE PANPUT COMMAND REQUIRED IS
         PANPUT ZX105000
    2) PLACE A PROC INTO 'FPC.PROCLIB' FROM A DATASET PROC.CNTL
         PANPUT RR050R0P LIB('FPC.PROCLIB') DA(PROC.CNTL)
    3) PROCESS A PAN#1 INPUT DATA SET PAN.CNTL AGAINST 'FPC.WORK'
         PANPUT * DA(PAN.CNTL)
       THE ASTERISK IMPLIES CONTROL INPUT.

)O OPERANDS -
  'PAN-DSNAME' - THE NAME OF THE PANVALET MEMBER CONTAINED WITHIN
                 THE PANVALET LIBRARY WHICH IS TO BE ADDED OR
                 REPLACED.
    *          - IMPLIES A CONTROL INPUT STREAM.  SEE CONTROL KEYWORD
                 FOR DETAILS.
))LIBRARY      - SPECIFIES THE PANVALET LIBRARY TO BE OPERATED ON.
))DATASET      - SPECIFIES THE SOURCE OF INPUT TO BE USED.  THIS MUST
                 BE A CARD-IMAGE DATASET.  A MEMBER OF A PDS MAY BE
                 SPECIFIED.
))UPDATE       - THIS SPECIFIES THAT THE PANVALET DATASET IS ALREADY
                 EXISTENT AND IS TO BE REPLACED.  FPC.WORK AND
                 FPC.SOURCE ARE TREATED AS A COMMON LIBRARY SO THAT
                 IF THE PAN-DSNAME IS EXISTENT IN EITHER LIBRARY
                 THEN UPDATE SHOULD BE SPECIFIED.  IF UPDATE IS
                 SPECIFIED BUT THE PAN-DSNAME IS NOT EXISTENT
                 AN ERROR IS FLAGGED.  UPDATE IS THE DEFAULT.
))ADD          - SPECIFIES THAT THE PAN-DSNAME IS NEW.  IF ADD IS
                 IS SPECIFIED AND THE PAN-DSNAME IS EXISTENT THEN
                 THE PUT IS ABORTED.
  'TYPE'       - SPECIFIES THE TYPE OF DATASET TO BE ADDED.  THIS IS
                 THE SAME AS LISTED IN THE PAN#1 MANUAL UNDER THE
                 ADD COMMAND DESCRIPTION.
))CONTROL      - INDICATES THAT THE INPUT DATASET CONTAINS VALID PAN
                 COMMANDS.  THIS MODE IS USEFUL TO PROCESS A PAN
                 INPUT STREAM UNDER TSO.
))NOCONTROL    - INDICATES THAT ANY PAN#1 COMMANDS FOUND IN THE INPUT
                 DATASET SHOULD BE INGNORED.  THIS DOES NOT AFFECT
                 EMBEDDED INCLUDES STARTING IN COLUMN 8 OF A COBOL
                 PROGRAM.  NOCONTROL IS THE DEFAULT.
