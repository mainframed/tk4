)F FUNCTION-
  THE PANGET COMMAND IS USED TO COPY 80-BYTE LOGICAL RECORDS
  FROM AN ON-LINE PANVALET LIBRARY TO AN OS-TYPE DATASET WHICH
  CAN THEN BE ACCESSED BY TSO.  THE RESULTING DATASET CAN BE
  A SEQUENTIAL OR PARTITIONED DATASET.  IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE
  TO LIST THE PAN-DATASET ON THE TERMINAL DIRECTLY.
)X SYNTAX-
  PANGET  'PAN-DATASET'  LIBRARY('PAN-LIBRARY')
          DATASET('DATASET'/*)
          NUMBER/NONUMBER
          INCREMENT('VALUE')
          EXPAND/NOEXPAND

  REQUIRED 'PAN-DATASET'
 DEFAULTS - LIBRARY('FPC.WORK')
            DATASET(PAN-DSNAME + QUALIFIER)
            NONUMBER
            NOEXPAND
  NOTE - IF THE DATASET KEYWORD IS NOT SPECIFIED A SEQUENTIAL
         DATASET NAME IS GENERATED FROM THE THE PAN-DSNAME PLUS
         AN APPROPRIATE QUALIFIER.  FOR EXAMPLE, IF A JCL TYPE
         DATASET IS STORED ON PANVALET UNDER THE NAME TS930R0P
         THE THE RESULTING TSO DATASET NAME WOULD BE
         TS930R0P.CNTL   .  IF THAT DATASET ALREADY EXISTS THEN
         IT WILL BE REUSED; IF IT DOES NOT EXIST, THEN A NEW
         DATASET WILL BE CREATED.

         THIS PROCESSOR WILL ONLY PROCESS FIXED LENGTH RECORDS
         WITH A LOGICAL RECORD LENGTH OF 80.  ANY ATTEMPTS TO
         WRITE INTO A VARIABLE LENGTH PARTITIONED DATASET SUCH
         AS A CLIST DATASET WILL RESULT IN THE DESTRUCTION OF
         THE RECEIVING DATASET.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!

         THE DEFAULT BLKSIZE OF NEW DATASETS IS 4240.

)O OPERANDS-
  'PAN-DSNAME' - THE NAME OF THE PANVALET DATASET TO BE COPIED.
                 THIS NAME MUST BE 1-10 ALPHA-NUMERIC CHARACTERS.

))LIBRARY('PAN-LIBRARY')
               - THE NAME OF THE PANVALET LIBRARY TO BE REFERENCED
                 TO OBTAIN THE SPECIFIED PAN-DSNAME.

))DATASET('DATASET'/*)
               - THE NAME OF THE DATASET TO RECEIVE THE COPY.
                 THE DATASET MAY BE EXISTENT.  IF NOT EXISTENT,
                 A NEW DATASET IS CREATED WITH THE NAME SPECIFIED;
                 IF EXISTENT, THE DATA SET IS REUSED WITH ITS
                 ESTABLISHED ATTRIBUTES.  BEWARE OF VARIABLE
                 LENGTH DATASETS AS THEY WILL BE DESTROYED.
                 IF THE DATASET IS EXISTENT AND IT IS A PDS
                 AND NO MEMBER NAME WAS SPECIFIED THEN THE
                 PAN-DSNAME IS USED AS A MEMBER NAME TRUNCATED
                 TO A MAXIMUM LENGTH OF 8 CHARACTERS.  IF THE
                 THE MEMBER NAME IS SPECIFIED IT WILL BE USED
                 TO CREATE A NEW MEMBER OR REUSE AN EXISTING
                 ONE DEPENDING ON ITS PREVIOUS EXISTENCE.
                 IF A MEMBER NAME IS SPECIFIED FOR A NEW
                 DATASET THEN THE DATASET WILL BE PARTITIONED.

               - IF AN ASTERISK IS SPECIFIED THE PAN-DSNAME WILL
                 BE LISTED ON THE TERMINAL.  FOR 3270-TYPE TERMINALS
                 ONLY THE FIRST 78 COLUMNS WILL BE DISPLAYED.

))NUMBER
               - THIS OPERAND WILL CAUSE THE PROCESSOR TO GENERATE
                 TSO COMPATIBLE SEQUENCE NUMBERS IN COLUMNS
                 73 THROUGH 80.  NOTE THAT THIS IS NOT COMPATIBLE
                 WITH COBOL DATASET NUMBERING BUT IT HAS BEEN
                 FOUND THAT COBOL-TYPE DATASETS ARE EASIER TO
                 EDIT UNDER FSE IF THEY ARE TREATED AS DATA-TYPE
                 DATASETS.

))NONUMBER
               - THIS OPERAND WILL LEAVE COLS 73-80 AS PANVALET
                 WOULD NORMALLY GENERATE A LISTING.  IT IS THE
                 DEFAULT.

))INCREMENT('VALUE')
               - IF THE NUMBER OPTION IS USED, THIS KEYWORD CAN
                 BE USED TO SPECIFY THE INCREMENT USED FOR
                 SEQUENCING.  THE DEFAULT IS 10.

))EXPAND
               - THE OPTION SPECIFIES THAT IMBEDDED INCLUDE ARE
                 TO BE EXPANDED.

))NOEXPAND
               - THIS KEYWORD INHIBITS EXPANSION OF IMBEDDED
                 INCLUDES.  IT IS THE DEFAULT AND SHOULD BE
                 USED FOR MOST WORK.
