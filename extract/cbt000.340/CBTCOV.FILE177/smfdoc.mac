    ARE RECORDED ON MICROFICHE AND SELECTED REPORTS ARE PRINTED
    ON PAPER AND ROUTED TO CSD STAFF MEMBERS.  THE SYSTEM CONSISTS
    OF THE FOLLOWING STEPS:

     1.  CS301000 READS SMF MASTER AND DOES MONTH TO DATE REPORTS.
     2.  SORT SELECTED SMF RECORDS IN JOB SEQUENCE.
     3.  CS303000 READS SORTED SMF RECORDS AND DOES DAILY REPORTS.
     4.  SORT SELECTED XREF RECORDS IN XREF KEY SEQUENCE.
     5.  CS304000 READS SORTED XREF RECORDS AND DOES XREF REPORTS.
     6.  CS312000 CREATES FICHE AND SELECTED REPORTS

CS326R74 DEVICE UTILIZATION REPORT 8-5

THIS REPORT SHOWS THE MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, AND AVERAGE IO USAGE FOR EACH
5 MINUTE INTERVAL DURING THE PREVIOUS DAY.  IT ALSO SHOWS THE AVERAGE
IO RATE PER SECOND.  IN ADDITION IT CALCULATES A UTILIZATION PERCENTAGE
BASED ON THE NUMBER OF INTERVALS WITH SOME IO ACTIVITY DIVIDED BY THE
TOTAL NUMBER OF INTERVALS.  THE IO COUNTS ARE TAKEN FROM THE UNIT
CONTROL BLOCK (UCB) FIELD WHICH IS A CYCLICAL COUNT OF THE START IO
OPERATION ISSUED TO THE DEVICE.  THE COUNT IS A HALF WORD UNSIGNED
BINARY FIELD.  THIS REPORT ASSUMES THAT THE COUNTS DO NOT CYCLE WITHIN
A SINGLE 5 MINUTE INTERVAL (THIS WOULD REQUIRE A DEVICE WITH AN IO
RATE OF OVER 109 PER SECOND).


MIN   -  MINIMUM NUMBER OF IO OPERATIONS IN ANY INTERVAL

MAX   -  MAXIMUM NUMBER OF IO OPERATIONS IN ANY INTERVAL

AVG   -  AVERAGE NUMBER OF IO OPERATIONS FOR TOTAL PERIOD

SIOS  -  AVERAGE NUMBER OF IO OPERATIONS PER SECOND

%UTL  -  PERCENT UTILIZATION BASED ON NUMBER OF INTERVALS WITH
         NON ZERO IO COUNTS DIVIDED BY THE TOTAL NUMBER OF INTERVALS
