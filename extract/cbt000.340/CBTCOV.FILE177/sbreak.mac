 1. CALL NAME - SBREAK(ECB) AND EBREAK
 2. PAN  NAME - SR312000
 3. FUNCTION  - SETUP BREAK KEY CONTROL FOR TSO PROGRAMS
 4. ARGUMENTS - ECB - 4 BYTE EVENT CONTROL BLOCK POSTED EACH
                      TIME BREAK KEY IS HIT. ECB IS CLEARED
                      BY SBREAK BUT USER MUST CLEAR IT AFTER
                      EACH BREAK KEY HIT. ENTRY EBREAK MAY BE
                      CALLED TO CANCEL BREAK CONTROL EXIT.

 8. REF. DOCS.- SEE SR313000 FOR SAMPLE FORTRAN PROGRAM WHICH DOES
                THE FOLLOWING:
                 1.  CALL SBREAK(ECB)
                 2.  START LOOP
                 3.    PRINT CURRENT VALUE OF V.
                 4.    IF ECB NOT ZERO,
                          SET ECB TO ZERO
                          READ NEW VALUE FOR V
                          IF  V EQUAL 999 STOP.
                 5.  END LOOP
                IN SUMMARY, THIS PROGRAM KEEPS PRINTING WHATEVER
                VALUE OF V YOU ENTER EACH TIME YOU HIT BREAK UNTIL
                YOU ENTER 999.

                THE PRIMARY VALUE OF SBREAK IS TO ALLOW CONTROL AND
                MONITORING OF LONG RUNNING PROCESS FUNCTIONS.
