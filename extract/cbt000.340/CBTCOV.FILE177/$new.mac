  2.  FPCMON   - CONTINUOUS SYSTEM MONITOR WHICH LOGS THE FOLLOWING
                 INFORMATION AT SPECIFIED INTERVALS:
                   A.  CURRENT SIO COUNT FOR EVERY UCB.
                   B.  CPU, MEMORY, AND I/O COUNTS FOR
                       SELECTED FIXED TASKS AND THE MOST
                       ACTIVE REMAINING TASKS.
                   C.  DATE AND TIME OF LAST IPL.
                 THE INFORMATION IS STORED IN A DIRECT ACCESS FILE
                 AND IS IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE FOR ONLINE TSO
                 INQUIRY.  AT FPC THE INFORMATION IS LOGGED EVERY
                 5 MINUTES AND THE FILE IS LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD
                 THE LAST 7 DAYS ACTIVITY BEFORE THE FILE RECYCLES.
                 THE CURRENT DISPLAY FUNCTIONS INCLUDE:
                   A.  SELECT ANY PERIOD DURING THE LAST 5 DAYS.
                   B.  DISPLAY MINIMUM, MAXIMUM, AND AVERAGE UCB
                       SIO RATE FOR SELECTED UCBS DURING PERIOD.
                       THIS HAS BEEN USED VERY SUCCESSFULLY TO
                       IDENTIFY PROBLEM TP LINES AND UNBALANCED
                       DISK USAGE DUE TO SPECIFIC JOBS.  IT ALSO
                       SHOWS UTILIZATION OF ALL DEVICES.  YOU CAN
                       FIND VERY LOW USAGE DEVICES THIS WAY.
                   C.  DISPLAY CPU, MEMORY, AND I/O USAGE FOR
                       SELECTED AND HEAVY TASKS DURING ANY INTERVAL.
                       THIS IS VERY USEFUL FOR LOOKING AT WHAT WAS
                       HAPPENING WHEN THE SYSTEM SLOWED DOWN. THE
                       INFORMATION CAN BE LISTED OR GRAPHED.  IT
                       IS GREAT FOR LOOKING AT CICS ACTIVITY AND
                       GETTING A FEEL FOR THE DAILY LOAD CYCLE AND
                       THE IMPACT OF CHANGES OR PROBLEMS.
                   D.  DISPLAY SELECTED TASK AND SYSTEM INTERRUPTIONS
                       FOR ANY PERIOD.  THIS IS PERHAPS THE MOST
                       VALUABLE FUNCTION.  YOU CAN GET A VERY
                       OBJECTIVE REPORT OF EVERY CICS, TSO, AND
                       MVS INTERRUPTION FOR THE LAST HOUR, DAY, OR
                       WEEK.  YOU KNOW WITHIN 5 MINUTES, HOW LONG
                       EACH SYSTEM COMPONENT WAS DOWN.
