                    How to Process Tape Requests
                    ----------------------------

 1. Send anything other than a normal request for a copy of the SHARE
    MVS Group Modifications Tape to DJS.
 2. Add the name, address, and phone number of each requestor to
    SSD.SHARE.FILE014.DATA(LIST).
 3. Label each tape or cartridge as necessary so you can associate
    each one with its owner and mail it to the correct person.
 4. Update member SHRCOPYT in SSD.SHARE.FILE014.DATA to produce the
    desired number of tapes and submit the job. (Move the //EXTRA
    card after the last //MODnn card required.)
 5. Update member SHRCOPYC IN SSD.SHARE.FILE014.DATA to produce the
    desired number of cartridges.
 6. Enter "submit" on the command line of each member.
 7. Take the tapes and cartridges to operations for processing.  Give
    them the name of each job to be run (SHRCOPYT and SHRCOPYC).  The
    tapes will be processed by SHRCOPYT and the cartridges by SHRCOPYC.
    It is not necessary that the tapes or cartridges be processed in
    any particular order.
 8. Verify that the jobs ran correctly:
        - go into IOF (from spf master menu)
        - select SHRCOPYC/SHRCOPYT
        - select LOG
        - check to make sure there are only M's and K's and no error
          messages.
    OR:
        - m.q (from spf master menu)
        - enter h
        - select shrcopyc or shrcopyt
        - enter "find 134-files" on command line
        - there should be as many "134-files" as there are tapes/
          cartridges copied.
 9. Fill out the receipt on the cover letter.
10. Mail the tape and cover letter to each requestor.
11. Have DJS sign any checks which have his name on them.
12. Send the checks to Jackie Weatherspoon to be applied to account
    code SDC #5380 Misc. Income.

 Note:  You can print more cover letters by submitting member COVERPRT
        in SSD.SHARE.FILE014.DATA.  The cover letters are printed on the
        6670.
