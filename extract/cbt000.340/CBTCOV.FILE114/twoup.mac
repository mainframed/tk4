Dear SHARE member:

Enclosed is a copy of the SHARE MVS GROUP modification tape.  It is a
non-labeled tape recorded at 6250 bpi.  The first four files are as
follows:

.fo off
 FILE RECFM LRECL BLKSIZE  DESCRIPTION

  1    VB     84   32760   Tape Abstract in INFO/SYS format
  2    FB     80   32720   JCL used to create the tape
  3    FB     80   32720   JCL to load the entire tape to disk
  4    FB     80    3200   Object for unload program
.fo

All files above file 4 are in a compressed format (except load module
libraries).  The program in file 4 must be used to retrieve them.  Refer
to the JCL in file 3 for program usage.

The abstract on the first file of this tape is formatted to be built as
a separate INFO/SYS database.  This will permit online scanning of the
abstract.  Using Vxx, where xx is the version number of this tape, as a
keyword search will let a user find what has changed for this version.

For installations that do not have INFO/SYS, the first file can be
printed with IEBGENER and still used as an abstract.

Neither SHARE, INC. nor FEDERAL EXPRESS make any warranty as to the
accuracy or usefullness of the material on this tape, and no
responsibility is assumed for any consequence of using this material.

I would encourage you to submit any mods you have which would be of use
to others.  A submittal form and instructions are included on file 1 of
this tape.

I would also like to encourage all comments and suggestions on the
useability of this tape, especially on the format of the INFO/SYS
database.

The following JCL can be used to create the INFO/SYS database from the
first file of the tape and copy the unload JCL from the third file of
the tape to someplace you can modify it for your system.

.fo

You must then add a DD card to your INFO/SYS clist:

  ALLOC F(VSAMx) DA('SYS4.SHARE.OZ') SHR

Where "x" is a number between 2 and 9.  To get to the new database,
you enter SWITCH "x" while in INFO/SYS.  SWITCH with no operands will
return to the standard database.
