2. VERIFY THAT THERE ARE THE PROPER NUMBER OF MODN STEPS TO CREATE
   THE NUMBER OF MODS TAPES THAT YOU WANT.  E.G. IF YOU WANT TO CREATE
   10 MODS TAPES, YOU SHOULD HAVE 10 MODN STEPS.  YOU MAY WANT TO INSERT
   A TAPEMAP SETP TO DETERMINE THE LENGTH REQUIRED.
3. SUBMIT JOB AND CANCEL CHANGES.
4. WHEN JOB IS FINISHED, CHECK OUTPUT.  YOU MUST CHECK BOTH THE JOB
   LOG AND THE SAS LOGS AS SAS PROC TAPECOPY SOMETIMES WILL GIVE A

   OFF THE END OF THE REEL AND GIVES INTERVENTION REQUIRED.
5. FOR THOSE TAPES THAT COPIED CORRECTLY, EDIT SHARE.FILE014.DATA(LIST)
   AND ENTER THE NAME, ADDRESS, CONTACT INFORMATION, DATE RECEIVED,
   DATE SHIPPED, AND VERSION SHIPPED.  BOX THEM BACK UP WITH A MODS
   TAPE COVER LETTER AND GIVE THEM AND THE CHECKS TO ELLA.  THE CHECKS

   MODS TAPE 'SORRY ABOUT THAT' LETTER AND GIVE THEM TO ELLA.
