      This is the OS/MVT Release 21.8 SYS1.TCAMMAC from IBM.

      You don't have to worry about software licensing--you can use
all these macros for free.  At the time these macros were written,
IBM was giving away all its software for free.  Therefore these
macros are in the public domain.

      They are being included here for your use and enjoyment.
Please use them at your own risk.  The OS operating systems have
"changed a bit".  Good luck.
