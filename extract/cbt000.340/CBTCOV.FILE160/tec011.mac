    :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   :   8
     --------------------------------- -
  EACH QUADRANT IS DIVIDED INTO 100 SECTORS.






))WA     WARP ENGINES:

  COURSE = A REAL NUMBER FROM 0. TO 12..
 NUMBERS CORRESPOND TO THE DIGITS ON A CLOCK (I.E.
 2.5 INDICATES THE DIRECTION THAT THE HOUR HAND
 POINTS WHEN IT IS 2:30)


  WARP FACTOR = A REAL NUMBER FROM 1. TO 10.
 THE HIGHER THE WARP FACTOR, THE LESS TIME USED
 AND THE MORE ENERGY CONSUMED IN TRAVELLING FROM POINT TO
 POINT. WARP FACTORS GREATER THAN 6. MAY CAUSE
 ENGINE DAMAGE.



   WHEN YOU CHANGE QUADRANTS, HOWEVER, THE POSITIONS OF
  ALL OBJECTS IN THE NEW QUADRANT ARE RANDOMIZED TO SIMULATE 3-D TRAVEL.

  *** NOTE:  EVERY USE OF THE WARP ENGINES TAKES TIME.
  THE AMOUNT OF TIME USED IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE
  WARP FACTOR USED.
  IF THE ENTERPRISE IS BLOCKED BY SOMETHING
  DURING INTRA-QUADRANT TRAVEL IT WILL STOP IN FRONT
  OF IT (AND WASTE TIME) ***

  ***NOTE: THERE IS A TIME PORTAL AVAILABLE BY TRAVELLING
  AT WARP 10.  YOU MAY BE CARRIED EITHER FORWARD OR
  BACKWARD IN TIME

  ***NOTE:  IF THE ENTERPRISE RAMS A KLINGON VESSEL, EITHER
  DELIBERATELY OR ACCIDENTALLY, THE KLINGON WILL BE
  DESTROYED AND THE ENTERPRISE HEAVILY DAMAGED.

  ***THERE IS A COMMAND AVAILABLE TO MAINTAIN POSITION.
 ONE CAN SPECIFY THE LENGTH OF TIME TO REST (RE).
 THIS COMMAND ALLOWS ONE TO REPAIR DAMAGED DEVICES.



))IM     IMPULSE ENGINES:

 IMPULSE ENGINES ARE A SUPPLEMENT TO THE WARP
 ENGINES.  THEY COST 200 UNITS OF ENERGY TO ENGAGE
 AND 100 UNITS PER STARDATE; WITH IMPULSE ENGINES
 ONE CAN MOVE AT 1/2 QUADRANT PER STARDATE.





))SR     SHORT RANGE SENSORS:

     THE SHORT RANGE SENSORS OF THE ENTERPRISE DISPLAY
  A DETAILED VIEW OF THE QUADRANT IT IS CURRENTLY IN.
  THE ENTERPRISE LOOKS LIKE /E/ ON THE SCREEN.
  KLINGON BATTLE CRUISERS LOOK LIKE /K/ ON THE SCREEN.
  STARBASES LOOK LIKE /B/ AND STARS LOOK LIKE * .
  THE KLINGONS MAY HAVE POWERFUL COMMAND SHIPS, /C/.

  ***NOTE: DOCKING IS A TWO STEP PROCEDURE--FIRST YOU
  MUST MOVE ADJACENT TO THE BASE.  THEN EXECUTE "DO" TO DOCK.
  WHILE DOCKED, STARBASE SHIELDS PROTECT THE STARSHIP.

  ***NOTE: CONDITION YELLOW MEANS YOU ARE DANGEROUSLY
  LOW ON ENERGY AND SHOULD MAKE FOR A BASE POSTHASTE.






))LR     LONG RANGE SENSORS:

     THE LONG RANGE SENSORS OF THE ENTERPRISE DISPLAY
  THE NUMBER OF OBJECTS IN THE 9 CLOSEST QUADRANTS,
  WITH THE ENTERPRISE IN THE CENTRAL ONE.
  EACH DIGIT OF THE NUMBER IN EACH BOX MEANS SOMETHING:
     THE ONES DIGIT REPRESENTS THE NUMBER OF STARS.
        TENS                                STARBASES.
        HUNDREDS                             KLINGONS.
        THOUSANDS                            SUPERNOVA.
  FOR EXAMPLE:
  319 MEANS  3 KLINGONS, 1 STARBASE, AND 9 STARS.
  206 MEANS 2 KLINGONS, 0 STARBASES, AND 6 STARS.
  7 MEANS 0 KLINGONS, 0 STARBASES, AND 7 STARS.



))SU     ENERGY SHIELDS:

     WHILE THE ENERGY SHIELDS OF A STARSHIP ARE ACTIVATED,
  KLINGON ATTACKS ARE NULLIFIED.  EVERY TIME YOU MOVE WITH
  YOUR SHIELDS UP, ENERGY IS USED PROPORTIONAL TO WARP FACTOR

  SHIELD STRENGTH IS A MEASURE OF HOW MUCH ENERGY
  THE SHIELDS CAN WARD OFF DURING ATTACKS.   IT IS
  PRINTED AFTER SHIELD STATUS IN A S.R. SCAN.
  WHEN ATTACKED, SHIELD STRENGTH IS LOWERED,AND
  THE EFFECT IS CUMULATIVE.  WHEN STRENGTH REACHES
  0.0 THE SHIELDS ARE DISABLED.  STRENGTH MAY BE
  REGAINED BY DOCKING.



))PH     PHASERS:

     ANY PORTION OF THE ENERGY AVAILABLE CAN BE FIRED.
  THE BATTLE COMPUTER DIVIDES THIS AMOUNT AMONG THE
  KLINGON CRUISERS IN THE QUADRANT AND DETERMINES
  THE VARIOUS DIRECTIONS OF FIRE.  THE EFFECTIVENESS
  OF A HIT DEPENDS MOSTLY ON THE DISTANCE TO THE
  TARGET.  A KLINGON BATTLE CRUISER STARTS WITH  400
  UNITS OF ENERGY.  IT CAN FIRE AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO
  WHATEVER ENERGY IT HAS LEFT.


))PT     PHOTON TORPEDOES:

     INITIALLY THE ENTERPRISE HAS  10 PHOTON TORPEDOES.
  ONE TORPEDO DESTROYS WHATEVER IT HITS.  THE RANGE
  OF PHOTON TORPEDOES (LIKE PHASERS) IS LIMITED TO
  THE CURRENT QUADRANT.  THE COURSE OF A PHOTON TORPEDO
  IS SET THE SAME WAY AS THAT OF THE ENTERPRISE.
  YOU MAY, IF YOU WISH, FIRE A BURST OF THREE TORPEDOES
  AT ONCE.  THERE IS A TIME LAG IN LAUNCHING THEM, AND
  THEY ARE FIRED IN A COUNTERCLOCKWISE SEQUENCE.
  FOR EXAMPLE, A TORPEDO COURSE OF 3.49 WITH A BURST
  ANGLE OF 0.24 WOULD FIRE TORPEDOES AT DIRECTIONS
  3.25, 3.49, AND 3.73 . IF A PHOTON TORPEDO HITS
  A STAR THAT STAR NOVAS AND DESTROYS ANYTHING IN
  ADJACENT SECTORS. THE ENTERPRISE WILL NOT BE DESTROYED
  BUT WILL LOSE 2000 UNITS OF ENERGY.
  THERE IS ONE CHANCE IN TWENTY THAT THE STAR WILL SUPERNOVA,
  IN WHICH CASE THE ENTERPRISE WILL AUTOMATICALLY ATTEMPT
  TO LEAVE THE QUADRANT (GOOD LUCK).




))DA     DAMAGE CONTROL REPORT:

     THE DAMAGE CONTROL REPORT LISTS THE MAIN DEVICES AND
  TIME REQUIRED TO BE REPAIRED. REPAIR  IS 10 TIMES FASTER WHILE DOCKED.



))CH     STAR CHART:

        AT ANY TIME, ONE CAN OBTAIN A STAR CHART THAT SHOWS WHAT IS
  IN ALL QUADRANTS THAT THE ENTERPRISE HAS SCANNED, WITH EITHER LONG
  OR SHORT RANGE SENSORS.  THE FORMAT OF EACH QUADRANT IS IDENTICAL
  TO THAT OF THE LONG RANGE SCAN.




))BC     BATTLE COMPUTER:

        A BATTLE COMPUTER IS AVAILABLE WHICH MAKES AVAILABLE MANY
  USEFUL CALCULATIONS. COMMANDS ARE:
        PH      PHASER STRENGTH NEEDED TO KILL EACH KLINGON IN QUADRANT
        CO      COURSE TO ANY OTHER POINT (SECTORS OR QUADRANTS)
        DI      DISTANCE TO ANY OTHER POINT.
        BO      BOTH COURSE AND DISTANCE
        ST      EXIT FROM BATTLE COMPUTER MODE.


  *** NOTE: KLINGONS ARE NOT STATIONARY. THEY CAN EITHER
  MOVE IN AND ATTACK OR RETREAT. KLINGONS WILL NOT
  MOVE INTO A QUADRANT CONTAINING A STAR BASE NOR WILL
  THEY RETREAT FROM A QUADRANT CONTAINING A KLINGON
  COMMAND SHIP. HOWEVER, WITHIN ANY GIVEN QUADRANT, KLINGONS
  ARE STATIONARY (I.E. DO NOT MOVE ABOUT
  WITHIN THE QUADRANT).



*** NOTE ***:A RECENT IMPROVEMENT (BY P.L.DEWOLF) ALLOWS YOU TO TYPE ALL
THE ARGUMENTS TO A GIVEN COMMAND ON ONE LINE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE SEQUENCE
        COMMAND:MO
        COURSE:3.14159
        DISTANCE:1.57

CAN BE ABBREVIATED TO THE FOLLOWING:
        COMMAND:MO 3.14159 1.57
IF A COMMAND TAKES N ARGUMENTS AND YOU TYPE N-1 OF THEM ON ONE LINE,
THE LAST QUESTION ORDINARILY ASKED WILL BE ASKED JUST AS IF YOU HAD TYPE
EACH ARGUMENT ON A SEPARATE LINE (THE BATTLE COMPUTER IS AN EXCEPTION TO
TYPE EACH ARGUMENT ON A SEPARATE LINE OR TYPE ALL ARGS ON ONE LINE, BUT
NOTHING IN BETWEEN).



))DE    SELF DESTRUCT:

THE COMMAND "SELF DESTRUCT" (DE), PLUS THE SECRET PASSWORD REQUIRED
FOR ACTIVATION, SETS IN MOTION THE SHIP'S DESTRUCT MECHANISM. USED ONLY
IN THE MOST DESPERATE OF CIRCUMSTANCES, THE END IS SHORT AND SWEET. AT
COMPLETION OF THE SELF DESTRUCT SEQUENCE, THE USER IS LOGGED OFF. NEEDLE
TO SAY, THIS IS THE COWARD'S WAY OUT.


))AB    ABANDON SHIP:

THIS COMMAND ALLOWS THE CAPTAIN OF THE ENTERPRISE AND SELECT CREW MEMBE
TO ESCAPE ANY IMPENDING DOOM IN A SHUTTLE CRAFT. YOU MAY BE CAPTURED BY
THE DEADLY KLINGONS, BUT IF YOU ARE CAPTURED, YOU MIGHT FIND YOUR WAY
BACK TO THE FEDERATION. IF SO, MAYBE YOU CAN TALK THEM INTO GIVING YOU
COMMAND OF ANOTHER SHIP, BUT YOU WILL NEVER BE GIVEN A THIRD SHIP.
))LO     LOG ENTRY:

THE LOG ENTRY WILL RECORD VARIOUS INFORMATION IN THE CAPTAIN'S LOG. THI
INFORMATION IS STORED IN THE "STARTR.LOG" FILE IN THE USER'S AREA. IT
WILL ALSO BE PRINTED ON THE TERMINAL WHEN THE COMMAND IS GIVEN (LO). AN
AUTOMATIC LOG ENTRY IS MADE AT THE COMPLETION OF EACH MISSION. FROM TIME
TO TIME, THE CAPTAIN SHOULD RETRIEVE THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THE
LOG.
))TP     TELEPORTER:

THE TELEPORTATION UNIT ABOARD THE ENTERPRISE TRANSMITS A SECRET SIGNAL
TO A RANDOM STARBASE WHICH ACTIVATES THE STARBASE'S TELEPORTATION
EQUIPMENT WHEN THE COMMAND (TP) IS GIVEN BY THE CAPTAIN. THE SHIP IS
THEN TELEPORTED TO THE DISTANT STARBASE AND DOCKED AUTOMATICALLY. THE
TELEPORTATION PROCESS REQUIRES A TIME EXPENDITURE OF .75 STARDATES. THE
UNIT ABOARD THE SHIP MAY BECOME DAMAGED AND RENDERED USELESS FOR A
PERIOD OF TIME.
))DR     EXPERIMENTAL DEATH RAY:

EXPERIMENTAL MEANS EXPERIMENTAL. FEDERATION SCIENTISTS HAD HOPED TO
PERFECT THE DEATH RAY BEFORE IT WAS INSTALLED IN YOUR SHIP, BUT THEY
LACKED THE NECESSARY FUNDS TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT, DUE TO COST
OVERRUNS. IT WAS DESIGNED TO DESTROY ALL OF THE DEADLY KLINGONS IN
THE QUADRANT WHERE IT WAS USED, BUT FIELD REPORTS HAVE VARIED
SIGNIFICANTLY WITH REGARD TO REPORTED OPERATION OF THE EXPERIMENTAL
DEATH RAY. UTMOST CAUTION, THEREFORE, SHOULD BE EXERCISED IN THE USE OF
THIS WEAPON UNTIL THE BUGS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. THE COMMAND (DR) WILL
PROMPT A QUESTION AS TO WHETHER YOU ARE SURE YOU WISH TO FIRE THE
EXPERIMENTAL DEATH RAY. YOU SHOULD RESPOND WITH A YES (Y) OR A NO (N).
SHOULD YOU WISH TO BYPASS THE QUESTION, TYPE "DR YES (Y)" OR "DR NO (N)"
INSTEAD. GOOD LUCK . . . YOU'LL NEED IT.
