                  PROGRAM START

        SOMEWHERE NEARBY IS COLOSSAL CAVE, WHERE OTHERS HAVE FOUND FORTU
        TREASURE AND GOLD, THOUGH IT IS RUMORED THAT SOME WHO ENTER ARE
        SEEN AGAIN.  MAGIC IS SAID TO WORK IN THE CAVE.  I WILL BE YOUR
        AND HANDS.  DIRECT ME WITH COMMANDS OF 1 OR 2 WORDS.  I SHOULD W
        YOU THAT I LOOK AT ONLY THE FIRST FIVE LETTERS OF EACH WORD, SO
        HAVE TO ENTER "NORTHEAST" AS "NE" TO DISTINGUISH IT FROM "NORTH"
        (SHOULD YOU GET STUCK, TYPE "HELP" FOR SOME GENERAL HINTS.  FOR
        MATION ON HOW TO END YOUR ADVENTURE, ETC., TYPE "INFO".)

                     IF YOU TYPE IN HELP

        I KNOW OF PLACES, ACTIONS, AND THINGS.  MOST OF MY VOCABULARY
        DESCRIBES PLACES AND IS USED TO MOVE YOU THERE.  TO MOVE, TRY WO
        LIKE FOREST, BUILDING, DOWNSTREAM, ENTER, EAST, WEST, NORTH, SOU
        UP, OR DOWN.  I KNOW ABOUT A FEW SPECIAL OBJECTS, LIKE A BLACK R
        HIDDEN IN THE CAVE.  THESE OBJECTS CAN BE MANIPULATED USING SOME
        THE ACTION WORDS THAT I KNOW.  USUALLY YOU WILL NEED TO GIVE BOT
        OBJECT AND ACTION WORDS (IN EITHER ORDER), BUT SOMETIMES I CAN I
        THE OBJECT FROM THE VERB ALONE.  SOME OBJECTS ALSO IMPLY VERBS;
        PARTICULAR, "INVENTORY" IMPLIES "TAKE INVENTORY", WHICH CAUSES M
        GIVE YOU A LIST OF WHAT YOU'RE CARRYING.  THE OBJECTS HAVE SIDE
        EFFECTS; FOR INSTANCE, THE ROD SCARES THE BIRD.  USUALLY PEOPLE
        TROUBLE MOVING JUST NEED TO TRY A FEW MORE WORDS.  USUALLY PEOPL
        TRYING UNSUCCESSFULLY TO MANIPULATE AN OBJECT ARE ATTEMPTING SOM
        BEYOND THEIR (OR MY!) CAPABILITIES AND SHOULD TRY A COMPLETELY
        DIFFERENT TACK.  TO SPEED THE GAME YOU CAN SOMETIMES MOVE LONG
        DISTANCES WITH A SINGLE WORD.  FOR EXAMPLE, "BUILDING" USUALLY G
        YOU TO THE BUILDING FROM ANYWHERE ABOVE GROUND EXCEPT WHEN LOST
        FOREST.  ALSO, NOTE THAT CAVE PASSAGES TURN A LOT, AND THAT LEAV
        ROOM TO THE NORTH DOES NOT GUARANTEE ENTERING THE NEXT FROM THE
        GOOD LUCK!

                     WHEN YOU TYPE IN INFO


        IF YOU WANT TO END YOUR ADVENTURE EARLY, SAY "QUIT".  TO SUSPEND
        ADVENTURE SUCH THAT YOU CAN CONTINUE LATER, SAY "SUSPEND" (OR "P
        OR "SAVE").  TO SEE WHAT HOURS THE CAVE IS NORMALLY OPEN, SAY "H
        TO SEE HOW WELL YOU'RE DOING, SAY "SCORE".  TO GET FULL CREDIT F
        TREASURE, YOU MUST HAVE LEFT IT SAFELY IN THE BUILDING, THOUGH Y
        PARTIAL CREDIT JUST FOR LOCATING IT.  YOU LOSE POINTS FOR GETTIN
        KILLED, OR FOR QUITTING, THOUGH THE FORMER COSTS YOU MORE.  THER
        ALSO POINTS BASED ON HOW MUCH (IF ANY) OF THE CAVE YOU'VE MANAGE
        EXPLORE; IN PARTICULAR, THERE IS A LARGE BONUS JUST FOR GETTING
        DISTINGUISH THE BEGINNERS FROM THE REST OF THE PACK), AND THERE
        OTHER WAYS TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH SOME OF THE
        HARROWING SECTIONS.  IF YOU THINK YOU'VE FOUND ALL THE TREASURES
        KEEP EXPLORING FOR A WHILE.  IF NOTHING INTERESTING HAPPENS, YOU
        HAVEN'T FOUND THEM ALL YET.  IF SOMETHING INTERESTING *DOES* HAP
        IT MEANS YOU'RE GETTING A BONUS AND HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GARNE
        MORE POINTS IN THE MASTER'S SECTION.  I MAY OCCASIONALLY OFFER H
        IF YOU SEEM TO BE HAVING TROUBLE.  IF I DO, I'LL WARN YOU IN ADV
        HOW MUCH IT WILL AFFECT YOUR SCORE TO ACCEPT THE HINTS.  FINALLY
        SAVE PAPER, YOU MAY SPECIFY "BRIEF", WHICH TELLS ME NEVER TO REP
        THE FULL DESCRIPTION OF A PLACE UNLESS YOU EXPLICITLY ASK ME TO.
