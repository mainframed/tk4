With the new year upon us the following changes have been implemented:

1.  Attendance Authorization Form Dialog
    All references to D.C. Parcell must be changed to T.R. Whitby since
    they have exchanged positions effective January 3rd 1989.  This
    change must be made by each user when creating or re-printing an
    Attendance Authorization Form.

2.  Change Notice Dialog Update
    The Change Notice File referenced by 'CURRENT' now contains only
    change notices for 1989.  All references to 1988 change notices will
    require that the Change Notice File be specified as YEAR88.
