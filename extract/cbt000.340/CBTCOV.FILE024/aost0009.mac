 Updates to various AOST ISPF Panels:

 The Change Notice Management ISPF Panels have been updated to clarify
 the meaning of many of the required fields.  For those of you with
 color terminals there is an added bonus of having colorful panels.

 The PRINTOFF and GENPRINT ISPF Panels have also been updated to
 simplify use and to add color.

 Thanks to Mike Theys of the SWCC for these changes.
