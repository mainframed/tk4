                Technical Proposal Dialog (status update)

The Rockwell Technical Proposal Dialog will be updated on the AOST Admin
panel on Thursday evening (10-22).  Any proposals that have been created
to this date will not be able to be printed with this new dialog.

If you wish to use the old dialog, it can be accessed via the %TECHPROP
command under ISPF option 6.

The new dialog is entered via %RTP and can be defined in one of the user
specified menu panels with different application id's to allow for multi
technical proposal tables and thus support multiple default requestors.

Note: do NOT use the same table dataset as the old dialog and do NOT use
same table dataset for more than one application id (NEWAPPL).

Use the OS&T Feedback dialog with questions or call Lionel Dyck on COMNE
374-1125.
