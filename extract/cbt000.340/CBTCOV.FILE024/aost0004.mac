 The production version of the PDS TSO Command Processor Version 8 has b
 installed on WCC1/2/3 and will be installed in Dallas shortly.

 An improvement over the Version 8 BETA level is the addition of two com
 which allow a quick exit from PDS instead of being prompted for the exi
 option.  The new commands are 'QUIT', which can be entered anywhere and
 'XX' which can be entered everywhere except the final prompt panel.
