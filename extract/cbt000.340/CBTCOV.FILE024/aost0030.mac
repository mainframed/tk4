A new command, SAFECOPY, has also been installed.

PFKINIT dialog.  This dialog was written/updated by Dave Fay based upon
from the GUIDE ISPF Mods tape.  This dialog allows you to copy the PFK
definitions from one ISPF application id to another.

AA dialog update.  A new option, C, is now available that will allow you
copy an existing AA so that it can be updated.

SAFECOPY command.

     SAFECOPY is a copy command which enables several users to update
     the same dataset simultaneously, without conflicting with each
     other or with users who are reading the dataset.  SAFECOPY is
     especially useful in CLISTs which write to a common dataset.
