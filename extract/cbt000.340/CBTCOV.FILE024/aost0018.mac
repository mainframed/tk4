                    Dialog to Compliment Info/Access

A new dialog has been developed to compliment the IBM Information/Access
product by taking the sequential file created that contains multiple SYS
adding them as members to a partitioned dataset.

The dialog can be accessed from the AOST System Programmer Menu (2.4 fro
AOST Master Menu) as option 28, or by invoking the clist ADDSYSMD.

Use the OS&T Feedback dialog with questions or call Lionel Dyck on COMNE
374-1125.
