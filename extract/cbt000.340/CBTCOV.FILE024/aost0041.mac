The PDS Command and ISPF Dialog will be updated to Version 8.2 effective
on October 17th (Monday).  This TSO Command and ISPF Dialog have proven
to be very popular because of the powerful capabilities that it provides
when working with partitioned data sets.  Below is the description from
the author of the enhancements to this new version (followed by the
description for Version 8.1 for those still running with PDS 8.0).

This command is a direct result of our participation in SHARE and a
relationship that we have developed with the author of PDS.

Any questions should be directed to the AOST System Coordinator using
the AOST Feedback dialog.
