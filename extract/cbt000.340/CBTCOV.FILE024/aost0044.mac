                 VSAM Data Set Browse ISPF Dialog

A new ISPF Dialog is now available from the AOST Data Set Management
Utilities Menu (option 1 on the AOST Primary Application Menu).  This
simple dialog is based on a sample assembler program provided by IBM
that uses the ISPF BRIF (Browse InterFace) to process VSAM KSDS and ESDS
data sets.

The source for this dialog can be found in AOST.SOURCE as member VSAMBR.
It is an excellent example of how to write an ISPF dialog to process any
data set organization using ISPF Browse.
