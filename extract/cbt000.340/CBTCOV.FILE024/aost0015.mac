 Revised Technical Proposal Form to be installed 10/16 7AM

The Rockwell Technical Proposal Form has changed and per IL 87-JRN-321 t
form that is generated by the AOST ISPF Dialog will be changed effective
on Friday the 16th of October.  This change will prevent ALL Technical
Proposals that have been previously entered from being printed as the fo
will no longer support the old format.

Therefore it will be mandatory that ALL proposals that are currently bei
worked on MUST be printed before this date.....!!!!

 Direct any questions/problems via OS & T Feedback.
