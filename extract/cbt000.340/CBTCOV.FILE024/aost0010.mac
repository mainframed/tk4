 Updates to AOST Change Notice Dialog:

 The Change Notice Dialog has been updated to support history files for
 change notices.  This means that all change notices for 1984, 1985 and
 are now contained in seperate datasets to reduce the amount of change
 notices in the current dataset that must be processed each time a repor
 generated.

 To access change notices created in prior years enter YEARnn in the yea
 prompt on the change notice primary panel.  nn should be a valid year f
 which a change notice catagory exists (e.g. 84, 85).
