          GENPRINT now Supports Suppression of Sequence Numbers

A new parameter has been added to the GENPRINT program that will support
suppression of sequence numbers that are found in JCL, SOURCE and CLIST
members that might wish to be printed.  By specifying SNUM=Y, you are in
to GENPRINT that all sequence numbers are to be suppressed when the memb
data set is printed.

The AOST ISPF Dialogs X2700 and X9700 have also been updated to reflect
option.
