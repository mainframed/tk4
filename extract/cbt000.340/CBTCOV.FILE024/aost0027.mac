To run the macro:

   The DIAGRAM macro (part of DRAW Clist) can be used to set up the
   environment for drawing.  You can use it as an initial macro or enter
   the editor command line.  It will set your PF keys (by calling the DR
   macro) and redefine the END and CANCEL commands to reset the keys (vi
   NORMKEYS macro) when you leave the editor.  You can also call the DRA
   and NORMKEYS macros directly if you do not wish to use DIAGRAM.  Modi
   DRAWKEYS and NORMKEYS macros to suit your particular needs.

   The DRAW macro (part of DRAW Clist) is run only if you do not defined
   as a program macro (DEFINE DRAW PGM MACRO) or do not prefix DRAW with
   After you have done either of these things once during an edit sessio
   editor will run the program version directly.

   A complete tutorial on the functions of DRAW is available by entering
   !DRAW HELP command on the editor command line.
