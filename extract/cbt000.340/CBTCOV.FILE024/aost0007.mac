 A new updated version of the JES3 Spool Display Facility has been insta
 and is now available for use on WCC1, WCC2, WCC3 and WCC6.  This new
 version incorporates a number of enhancements.

 1.  When you are in Browse on a sysout dataset for a job that is curren
     active you can type REFRESH or REF on the command line and the
     dataset will be refreshed so that you will be browsing a more recen
     copy of the data being written to spool.

 2.  Several changes in the control block formatting and console interfa
     are now available for system programmers.

 3.  On the job selection panel it is now possible to select all jobs
     active on all processors by specifying MAIN S in the Scheduler
     Element selection field.  By specifying MAIN SH you can select
     all jobs active on processor H.

 Direct any questions/problems to Lionel Dyck via the AOST Feedback dial
