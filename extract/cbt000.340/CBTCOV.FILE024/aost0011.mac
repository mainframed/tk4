     NEW COMMAND TO SHOW CALENDAR FOR CURRENT OR GIVEN MONTH YEAR:

  An ISPF command is available that will 'popup' a calendar for the
  current month in a window on your screen.  This calendar will overlay
  a small portion of what is currently displayed on your terminal.  It
  will remain on your screen for about 10 seconds and will then
  automatically disappear.  Your original display will be fully
  restored.  You do NOT have to use your end key to terminate this
  function.  The name of the ISPF command is  MONTHPOP.

  When the current month is requested, the output includes the current
  time in AM/PM format, julian date, and the current day is marked on
  the calendar.  The display format is similiar to VM/PROFS.  You may
  also display the calendar for any month in 1583 thru 9999.  The ISPF
  command "MONTHPOP" can be entered from any ISPF panel with a COMMMAND
  OPTION ===> line.
