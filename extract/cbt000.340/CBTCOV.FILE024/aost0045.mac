                  PTF in Error (PE) Reporting Utility

A new ISPF Dialog is now available on the AOST System Utilities Menu
(option 4 on the AOST Primary Application Menu) that will generate the
necessary JCL to execute the PELIST utility.

The PELIST utility processes SMP/E CSI zones and reports on all PTFs
that are marked PE (PTF in Error) that are in APPLY status.  It also
reports on what the correcting APAR and/or PTF is if one is available.
