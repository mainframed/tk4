A new version of the JES3 Spool Display Facility (SDF) will be installed
use by AOST and ATSO.SYS users.  This new version incorporates a number
enhancements, including performance improvements.

Installation Dates:     WCC1   12-10-87  first shift
                        WCC2   12-14-87  first shift

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+



Spool Display Facility (SDF) is a full-screen  ISPF  dialog  application
which performs JES3 utility functions for a TSO user.

With SDF you can perform functions such as the following:

o   Search/display the JES3 job queue
o   Browse/requeue/reprint/transmit SYSIN/SYSOUT data sets
o   Modify/cancel output
o   Cancel jobs including DJC networks
o   Place jobs on hold and release jobs
o   Browse/reprint/copy/transmit SYSLOG by date/time
o   Examine spool SRF/MRF data sets
o   Display scrollable JES3 console
o   Enter JES3 commands (authorized users)

SDF  can  be  used  to  access  both  held  and non-held data sets.   In
addition, SDF can access data sets for a job either before,  during,  or
after job execution.

SDF  is  normally used to access spool data belonging to the user's JES3
complex.  SDF may also, however, be used to access spool data sets owned
by another JES3 complex.  This is often very useful  for  examining  job
output  or  JES3  control blocks for a system which is down or otherwise
inaccessible.

When accessing spool in another JES3  complex,  many  SDF  commands  and
options  are  not available to the user.  All features which require use
of the Subsystem Interface are then disabled.

SDF includes security exits which an installation  can  use  to  protect
output and restrict functions.

This  section explains how to invoke SDF and shows the primary functions
available to the user.



INVOKING SDF AS A TSO COMMAND


The Spool Display Facility can be used under ISPF  only.    SDF  may  be
called by entering the TSO SDF command from the ISPF command line.

The command syntax for the TSO SDF command is as follows:

    SDF  OPTION
          SSI/NOSSI                     (default SSI)
          CHKPNT(DDNAME)
          TRACE(N)
          REINIT

OPTION              Specifies any valid option that can be selected from
                    the  SDF main selection panel.  Causes the specified
                    option  to  be  selected  without   displaying   the
                    selection panel.

                    Valid select options that can be specified are:

                        J - perform job queue functions
                        L - perform system log functions
                        B - browse SRF/MRF spool file
                        C - console display
                        P - specify SDF parameter defaults
                        T - SDF tutorial

SSI                 Specifies  that regular subsystem services are to be
                    used for spool access.  This is the default mode and
                    allows access only to spool data sets  belonging  to
                    the user's JES3 complex.

NOSSI               Specifies  that no subsystem services are to be used
                    for spool access.  This allows read-only  access  to
                    spool  data  sets  in  another  JES3 complex.   Many
                    internal SDF options and  features  are  unavailable
                    when NOSSI is specified.

CHKPNT(DDNAME)      Specifies a ddname to which the JES3 checkpoint data
                    set  has  been allocated.  This operand is used only
                    when NOSSI is specified.  If NOSSI is specified  and
                    this parameter is omitted, a panel will be displayed
                    for  the user to the data set name and volser of the
                    JES3 checkpoint  data  set  for  the  system  to  be
                    accessed.

TRACE(N)            This  parameter activates an internal trace table of
                    all subroutine calls, returns, register contents and
                    return  codes.    This  operand  is   intended   for
                    debugging  purposes  only.   The value 'n' specifies
                    the size of the trace table in 1K units.

REINIT              This parameter forces the Spool Display Vector Table
                    (SDVT) in Extended CSA to  be  rebuilt.    The  SDVT
                    contains information extracted from the JES3 address
                    space  and is automatically built the first time SDF
                    is called after a system IPL.

                    This operand is intended for debugging purposes when
                    testing a new version of SDF.   It  could  be  used,
                    however,  if the SDVT were to become corrupted.  Use
                    of the REINIT operand requires OPER authority.

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+

CHANGES: OCTOBER 1987


o   Several areas of  internal  SDF  processing  redesigned  to  provide
    reduced CPU utilization and reduced paging.

o   The  SDFINIT  load  module  no  longer  requires an entry in the TSO
    authorized program table IKJEFTE8/IKJEFTAP.

o   The key 1 I/O interface has been eliminated.    This  requires  that
    JES3 APAR fix OY05654 be applied to your system.

o   SDF now requires a Type 3 SVC (SDFSVC).

o   SDF now requires an ISPF table library (ISPTLIB).

o   You  should  now specify NEWAPPL(SDF) when invoking SDF from an ISPF
    panel to reduce processing on initialization.

o   New UPDATE command to update status of all jobs on the  current  job
    selection list without rereading the entire JCT.

o   Changed  to  retain  purged  jobs  on job selection list (in *PURGED
    status) until UPDATE or REFRESH command is issued.

o   New HALT command to stop automatic scrolling on Console Display.

o   New SNAP command to take a snap dump for  diagnostic  purposes  from
    any panel while in SDF.

o   New TUTORIAL command to access the SDF tutorial from any panel while
    in SDF.

o   Added support for printing output on a VM 3812 printer.

o   On  the SRF/MRF Browse function, you may now specify '*' for the SRF
    identifier to browse a single spool block.

o   Format of search argument to  request  jobs  active  on  any  system
    changed to 'MAIN *'.

o   Transmit  function  now  validates the NJE node name on the transmit
    function.

o   Transmit function displays an NJE node selection list  if  the  user
    leaves the node name blank.

o   Copy,  transmit,  and  reprint  functions now allow the user to copy
    selected portions of a data set by line number.

o   Copy, transmit, and reprint functions now allow  the  user  to  copy
    data  from one job to multiple locations.  It is no longer necessary
    to exit from the data set selection list and enter it again.

o   Requeue select option changed from 'R' to 'Q' on both job  selection
    list and data set selection list.

o   RACF  and  ACF2  versions  of user exits combined into common source
    members.

o   New expanded parameter lists passed to security exits.

o   SDF now checks the security user  id  for  a  job  as  well  as  the
    submitting TSO user id for access authorization.

o   SDF  now  schedules  an SRB to the JES3 address space the first time
    SDF is called after an IPL  only.    The  information  retrieved  is
    retained in Extended CSA and chained from field SVTUSER1 in the JES3
    SSVT.

o   GENPRINT option no longer supported.
