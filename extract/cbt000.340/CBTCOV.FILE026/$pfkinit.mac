%FUNCTION
+    The PFKINIT command allows you to copy PFKey settings from one APPL
+    another, with certain restrictions. It should normally be used to c
+    special key settings from your standard APPLID (usually ISR) to oth
+    functions, such as EZOUT, which operate under a unique APPLID.
+
%SYNTAX+

     You may determine at any time the APPLID under which you are operat
     invoking the SESSION command. If no APPLID is displayed by that com
     the default (ISR) is in effect.
