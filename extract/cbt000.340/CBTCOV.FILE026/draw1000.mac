+  The%MOVE+and%OMOVE+functions are used to move the marked block to the
   cursor position.  Place the cursor at the position to which you want
   upper left hand corner of the marked block to be moved.

   The%MOVE+function will move the block destroying any characters that
   within the range of the block.  The marked block will travel to the c
   position.

   The%OMOVE+(Overlay Move) function will move the block to the cursor
   position but will not change any non-blank characters within the rang
   the block.  This is useful, for example, to move a box around a porti
   text.

  %Note:+You cannot move a block if the cursor is positioned such that p
   of the block would be moved past the record length of the data.
