    o  Clist example using special BUILD notation to handle trailing opt

       When a clist is used with a NEWAPPL(id) you can't use the techniq
       using "ISPEXEC VGET(ZTRAIL)" to get the passed trailing options.
       is usually done in this case on a ISPF Menu (w/o BUILD) is to act
       TRUNCate the entered option and to set the TRAILing options to a
       ISPF variable (say RTRAIL).  Then if RTRAIL is NOT a null value t
       clist is invoked with  say "OPT(&&RTRAIL)" keyword.  If the value
+      null then this keyword is not appended to the command.

       Since the BUILD facility must be general purpose and doesn't know
       commands or keywords need this feature, the following notation is
       available with Menu BUILD ISPF Command definitions:  The tilda sy
       ×~+ indicates that a Trailing option needs to be inserted (if it

       EXAMPLE:  How the File-AID clist is implemented for Menu BUILD:
         CMD(%ROCFA OPT('~')) NOCHECK NEWAPPL(FAXE)
         The 's around ~ are ONLY neccessary if nothing is passed { OPT(
         This is needed since clist keyword operands MUST have a value.
         If F.3.7 is used to invoke File-AID then  %ROCFA OPT('3.7') is
