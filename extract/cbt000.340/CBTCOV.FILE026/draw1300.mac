   macro from another edit macro.  You can use it to query whether or no
   block of text has been marked.

   The%FINDMARK+function will issue a return code of 0 if a marked block
   found.  The coordinates of the marked block will be placed in the fol
   shared pool variables:  MARKTROW (top row number), MARKBROW (bottom r
   number), MARKLCOL (left column), and MARKRCOL (right column).  If a b
   is not defined, a return code of 8 will be issued.
