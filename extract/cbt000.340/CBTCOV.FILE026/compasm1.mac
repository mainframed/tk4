%Command ===>_ZCMD

%COMPASM+compares two versions of an assembly language module. Normally
+content of the two modules is used for comparison; sequence numbers are
+used.
+
+Multiple passes are made over the two modules.  Source macro definition
+matched separately from open code.  Within matching macros or within op
+matching sequence symbols are identified. Then matching ordinary names
+identified between matching sequence symbols.  Matching non-trivial car
+identified between matching names.  Finally, matching trivial cards bet
+matching non-trivial cards are identified. Trivial cards are comments w
+simple repeated patterns or assembler control cards such as EJECT or SP
+
%SIZE ===> nnnnn+is the number of cards in whichever is the larger versi
+the module.
+
%COLUMN ===> nn+is the number of columns in a statement to compare. This
+normally 72, meaning columns 1-72. It can be reduced to avoid comparing
+comments. For example%COLUMN ===> 63+would avoid comparing APAR/PTF
+numbers.%COLUMN ===> 80+would allow comparing sequence numbers.
