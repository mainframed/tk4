%OPTION  ===>_ZCMD
%
+  The%OPTIONS+function displays a panel on which you can select which
   character set to use. %Option 1+selects the Text character set.  This
   character set is for terminals that support the text characters (for
   3278T). %Option 2+selects the Non-Text character set.  This character
   is for use on all terminals. %Option 3+selects the user-defined chara
   set. %Options 4 and 5+can be used to prime the user-defined character
   if you wish to only make a small change.

+  The%OPTIONS+parameter can be followed by a valid panel option (1-5).
   has the same effect as displaying the panel, entering the option and
   pressing enter.
