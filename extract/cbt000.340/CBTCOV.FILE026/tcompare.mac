+Tutorial ------------------% COMPARE  +--------------------------------
+
+
+   This program is used to compare two versions of the same source
+   program.  It will compare columns 1 through 72 or optionally columns
+   through 80.  A report of the comparison is written to the SYSPRINT
+   file.
+
+   The COMPARE program uses only columns 1 through 72; thus, any two
+   versions of a program may be easily compared even if one (or both) o
+   the files has been resequenced.  If neither file has been resequence
+   a PARM of "FULL" may be coded to request that all eighty columns be
+   used in the comparison.  A facility is also provided to ignore trivi
+   card images (such as " EJECT " or " SPACE 3 " in an assembler source
+   program). Parm option of COBOL will restrict the compare to columns
+   7 thru 72 only.
+
+
+   This COMPARE program originated at YALE University and was obtained
+   from the Connecticut Bank and Trust Company mods tape (file 226).
