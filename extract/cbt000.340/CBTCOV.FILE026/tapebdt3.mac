+
+      The dataset '&ZUSER..&TAPEVOL1..CNTL' already exits.
+
+      Either &TAPEVOL1 is currently being transferred or a transfer was
+      aborted.
+
+      If STATUS shows no jobs and BDT I Q does not show transactions
+      TD&TAPEVOL1 and IN&TAPEVOL1 in the BDT queue, then a transfer has
+      aborted and the datasets created by the dialog need to be deleted
+      before the tape can be successfully transfered.
+
+      Delete the following datasets to clean up an aborted transfer:
+
+     %'&ZUSER..&TAPEVOL1..CNTL' at &Z$CENTER..
+     %'&ZUSER..&TAPEVOL1..DISK' at &Z$CENTER..
+     %'&ZUSER..&TAPEVOL1..DISK' at &TOCEN
+
+      Not all of the above datasets may exist, depending on when the
+      transfer aborted.
