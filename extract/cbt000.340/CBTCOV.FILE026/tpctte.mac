%PRTTE+formats trace table entries:
+
+Limit output to a specific ASID:
+  %ASID+specifies the address space ID number.
+
+Obtain trace table from RTM2 Work Area pointed to by a TCB:
+  %ASID+specifies the address space ID number.
+  %TCB+specifies the relative TCB number in the address space.
+       The number is in a base 26 number system, where A = 0, B = 1, ..
+       Z = 25. Leading zeros (A's) are suppressed. You will rarely have
+       calculate this, since IPCS normally supplies the TCB name as out
+       other commands.
+
+       Examples:
+            TCB  #0 = A
+            TCB  #1 = B
+            TCB #25 = Z
+            TCB #26 = BA
+            TCB #27 = BB
