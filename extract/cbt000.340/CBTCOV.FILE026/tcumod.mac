%Tutorial ------------------  CUMOD    ---------------------------------
+
+  CUMOD is designed to create an SMP USERMOD by comparing your modified
+  source to that of the SMP managed source or macro.  All differences a
+  reported and a delta deck is generated with all appropriate SMP contr
+  cards.
+
+  The SMP pre-req's, FMID, SYSLIB and DISTLIB are determined by invokin
+  SMP to do a list on the given element.
+
+  You may also provide any pre-req's or co-req's that SMP does not know
+  about at this point in time.
+
+  NOTE: if SMP=N is specified then only the report is generated and no
+        delta deck is produced.
