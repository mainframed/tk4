+      THIS UTILITY WILL READ A GDG INDEX STRUCTURE AND CHANGE THE
+      NUMBER OF ENTRIES DEFINED BY UNCATALOGING ALL ENTRIES UNDER
+      THE STRUCTURE, DELETING THE INDEX STRUCTURE, REBUILDING THE
+      INDEX STRUCTURE, AND RECATALOGING THE NECESSARY NUMBER OF
+      ENTRIES UNDER THE REBUILT INDEX. IF THE NEW INDEX CONTAINS
+      LESS ENTRIES THAN THE PREVIOUS INDEX AND THERE ARE GENERATIONS
+      LEFT OVER AFTER THE RE-CATALOGING, THE REMAINING GENERATIONS
+      ARE SCRATCHED IF THEY RESIDE ON A DASD DEVICE.
+
+      THIS UTILITY WILL ALSO LIST THE GDG INDEX STRUCTURE AND THE
+      ENTRIES CATALOGUED UNDER THE INDEX, ADD NEW INDEX STRUCTURES,
+      AND DELETE OLD INDEX STRUCTURES.
