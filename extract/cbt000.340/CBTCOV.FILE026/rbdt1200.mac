+ Any MVS/BDT transaction or command will produce messages on your scree
+ non-full screen mode. These messages are always produced after a varyi
+ delay.
+
+ If the messages are generated when you are not logged on, they will ap
+ the next time you logon. If you do not see expected messages at logon
+ execute the TSO  'LISTBC' command.
+
  Normal messages are:
  - a message indicating the transaction has been queued
  - a message establishing the transaction as a "Job"
  - messages indicating job completion (2 for a SEQ operation, 4 for a P
       operation)
  - a message for each "non-replaced" member in a partitioned dataset
