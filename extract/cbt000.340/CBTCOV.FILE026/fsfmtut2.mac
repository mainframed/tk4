%OPTION  ===>_ZCMD

 The Library search type of  USER  is set up so that you can search any
 own groups of libraries.  These may be your own personal data sets and/
 software libraries for your group.  You may set up as many groups as yo
 When you specify the "Search Library==>" USER  , FINDMEM will execute t
 FSFMUSER located in a clist library in SYSPROC.  There is a sample clis
 ATSO.SYS.CLIST that can be executed.  To execute your own version make
 like FSFMUSER and place it in a clist allocated via the PREISPF PREPROC
 operand. The PDSs to be searched must all be cataloged!

 FSFMUSER must allocate a FILE to a filename that is passed to the clist
 FINDMEM will see what datasets are allocated to the file and then searc
 PDS for the specified member.  The following variables are passed to yo
 FSFMUSER and can be used to determine which datasets to allocate:

`FSFMUSER:  `PROC 0 CENTER() MVS() CPU() ALLOCDD() PARM() +
+     where `&&CENTER+is SWCC, SWC2 etc.
+           `&&MVS   +is XA or 370.
+           `&&CPU   +is R, Q, W, etc.
+           `&&PARM  +is from the "USER option parm==>" on the main menu
+          `&&ALLOCDD+is the ddname to use in your final  ALLOC+FI(&&ALL
