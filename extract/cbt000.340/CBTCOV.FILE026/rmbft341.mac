×TUTORIAL ------ REBUILD your Saved Menu/Alias Options Utility --------
×COMMAND ===>_ZCMD
+
  This utility is used when you need to REBUILD or RELOAD your previousl
  menu and alias/instant access options.  Menu and alias options must ha
  SAVEd with the provided Menu Build SAVE Utility, either by you or some
  else.

  The format in which your options were saved determines how you must re
  them.  You must rebuild from a saved ISPF TABLE,  TEXT file, or by usi
  %RMBFINIT clist (which uses a saved table).

  Normally the table name or text file name on the REBUILD menu will be
  names you last used to save your options.  You should insure that your
  datasets are still available or that the saved table is in a PDS that
  currently allocated to the ISPTLIB ddname.  ISPTLIB is the file name u
  ISPF as an "input" table file.  This must be allocated prior to enteri
  and can be done by using the %PREISPF PRETLIB(table) option in your
  PROC.CLIST($ON).  After setting the REBUILD Type to its proper format,
  press ENTER and the options will be added and be available immediately
  the menu being restored.
