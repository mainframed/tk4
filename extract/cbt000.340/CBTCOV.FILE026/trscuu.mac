+
+ Because the device address is not a numeric field,  the search
+ and comparisons are done as character compares.  What this means
+ is that the HEX numeric order is not preserved.  On a character
+ collating sequence, A thru F come before 0 thru 9.  This means
+ that FFF is less than 000 in a character comparision.  And that
+ device address 8A0 is less than 810.
+
+ Use the   DeviceAddress GE xxx  AND  DeviceAddress LT xxx
+ selection as follows:
+
+ 1) To find all devices on channel 8. (i.e. device addresses 8xx.)
+    Use     ADDR GE 8   AND  ADDR LT 9
+ 2) To find all devices with address of the form 4Ax.
+    Use     ADDR GE 4A  AND  ADDR LT 4B
+ 3) To find all devices with address between 430-438
+    Use     ADDR GE 430 AND  ADDR LE 438    since all numeric in range
+ 4) To find all devices with address between 430-4E0
+    Must character scan ranges  4A <= ADDR <= 4E9  OR 43 <= ADDR <= 499
+    FOR EXAMPLE 4 FORGET THIS FEATURE FOR NOW !!
