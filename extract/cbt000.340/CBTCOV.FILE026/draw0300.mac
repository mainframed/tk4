+  The%POINT+function defines a point within the data.   The cursor must
   positioned on a valid data line when you define a point.  The current
   character will be placed at the cursor position.  The line that conta
   the point will be labelled with .POINT.

   You must use POINT before you use the LINE, ARROW, DARROW, or BOX
   functions.

   If a point is defined on a line that contains a MARK label (.MARK, .M
   or .MARKB), the marked block will be unmarked.
