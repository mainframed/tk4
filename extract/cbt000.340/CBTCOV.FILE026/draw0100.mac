   one user-definable character set (selectable via the%OPTIONS+function

   In addition to the drawing functions, a number of block manipulation
   functions are also available.  These functions enable you to selectiv
   copy, move, fill, or erase a block of characters.  These functions ar
   useful for types of data sets that do not even contain graphics.

   For example,%P+is sufficient for%POINT+but%M+is not sufficient for%MA
   because%MOVE+also starts with an M.

   functions such as%!DRAW POINT+and%!DRAW MARK.

  %Note: NUMBER+must be set to%OFF+before using the !DRAW macro.
