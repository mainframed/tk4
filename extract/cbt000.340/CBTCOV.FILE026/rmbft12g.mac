    Another facility exists to have options added to your menus by eithe
    Division or Group or by yourself.  This is done by re-loading many
    pre-defined menu options either manually initiated or automatically
    part of a Group Startup facility.  All of the menu and instant acces
    options can be saved in an ISPF table for future re-load. This saved
    information is similiar the Supported Options List, but includes the
    position on the panel to add the menu option.

    These tables or lists of saved options are built using a BUILD utili
    option to save the current menu/alias options into an ISPF table nam
    RMBFxxxx where xxxx is a name such as GRP (GROUP), USER, or other na
    These are re-loaded to merge with your current options by either usi
    BUILD utility to REBUILD your menu/alias options OR by you or your
    Group/Division execution a Menu Build Facility support clist called
    "RMBFINIT".  When  %RMBFINIT TABLE(xxxx) is invoked as part of an au
    Group Startup clist then the ISPF variables necessary to define your
    dynamic options on either the PDF primary menu or other BUILD suppor
    menus can be set and ready even before the new Primary Menu is displ
    The RMBFINIT clist is discussed futher in another section of the tut
