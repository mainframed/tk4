%Tutorial ---------------  AUTONUM  ------------------------------------
+
+
+     Autonum is designed to automatically number source statements whic
+     have been inserted into a source deck without sequence numbers.
+
+     Autonum reads the entire source deck into virtual storage and then
+     proceeds to insert sequence numbers in all records which have a
+     blank in columns 73-80.  If not enough virtual storage is getmaine
+     then AUTONUM will terminate with a user 001 abend.  The inserted
+     sequence number is generated from the last valid sequence number
+     plus the specified increment.  If the specified increment is too
+     large and causes a generated sequence number to equal or exceed a
+     pre-existing sequence number then AUTONUM will issue a TPUT and
+     terminate.
+
+     If processing finishes successfully then AUTONUM will write the
+     updated source deck back to where it read it if UPDATE=Y was
+     specified.  If UPDATE=N was specified then it will write it to the
+     specified output file.
