+THE I/O TO TAPE WOULD BE REDUCED BY 99.5 PERCENT.  WHATEVER BLOCK
+SIZE WAS USED TO WRITE THE DATA TO TAPE, IS WHAT WILL BE USED TO
+READ THE TAPE.  TO CHANGE HOW TAPE DATASETS ARE BLOCKED THEY MUST
+BE REWRITTEN.
+
+EACH BLOCK ON TAPE CAUSES AN IBG (INTERBLOCK GAP), WHICH MEANS
 A PORTION OF TAPE IS WASTED FOR EVERY BLOCK.  IN ADDITION, THE
 THE TAPE DRIVE READ-WRITE MECHANISM STOPS AND STARTS FOR EACH IBG,
 INCREASING THE I/O TIME AND ULTIMATELY THE JOB EXECUTION TIME.
