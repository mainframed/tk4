+      Two JCL streams have been built.
+
+      The first is JCL to copy the disk copy of the dataset in &TOCEN
+      to tape.  It will be submitted from BDT after the data has been
+      moved to &TOCEN .  The  JCL is in the following dataset:
+            '&ZUSER..&TAPEVOL1..CNTL'
+
+      The second dataset is JCL to copy the tape to disk here at &Z$CEN
+      Once the dataset is on disk, it will submit two BDT transactions.
+      The first, TP&TAPEVOL1, will copy the data from disk here to disk
+      &TOCEN.  The second, IN&TAPEVOL1, will submit the JCL to copy the
+      disk data to tape at &TOCEN.  The JCL is in the following dataset
+            '&ZTEMPF'
+
+      Do you wish to Browse (B), or Edit(E)
+      %===> _D1+ '&ZUSER..&TAPEVOL1..CNTL'

+      Do you wish to Browse(B), Edit(E), Submit(S), or Cancel
