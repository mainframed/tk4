  A Dependent Transaction Control (DTC) Network is made up of two or mor
  transactions whose sequential execution is controlled by the transacti
  in the Network.

+ Each transaction in a DTC Network is designated as a%predecessor+ and/
  a%successor+of other transactions. A particular transaction may not ex
  until it has been "released" by one or more predecessors; the executio
  that particular transaction may then cause the release of one or more
  successors.
