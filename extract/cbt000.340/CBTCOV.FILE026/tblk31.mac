+
+THE BLOCK SIZE ON 1600 BPI TAPES SHOULD APPROACH 16K WHILE THE
+BLOCK SIZE ON 6200 BPI SHOULD APPROACH 32K.  SINCE A DEFAULT OF
+5 BUFFERS IS USED FOR READING OR WRITING DATA, 32K WOULD USE
+TOO MUCH STORAGE IF REAL STORAGE IS LIMITED IN YOUR INSTALLATION.
+
+FOR THIS REASON, AN OPTIMUM BLOCK SIZE FOR TAPES IS CALCULATED
+CLOSEST TO 16K.
