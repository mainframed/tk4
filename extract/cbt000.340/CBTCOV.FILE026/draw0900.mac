+  The%COPY+and%OCOPY+functions are used to copy the marked block to the
   cursor position.  Place the cursor at the position to which you want
   upper left hand corner of the marked block to be copied.

   The%COPY+function will copy the block destroying any characters that
   within the range of the block.  If the block is not copied past the e
   of the record, the marked block will travel to the cursor position.

   The%OCOPY+(Overlay Copy) function will copy the block to the cursor
   position but will not change any non-blank characters within the rang
   the block.  This is useful, for example, to copy a box around a porti
   text.
