%TUTORIAL --------------------- DRAW - OPTIONS ------------------------
%OPTION  ===>_ZCMD
%
+  The%DRAW+macro uses the edit CHANGE command to draw the graphics.  Th
   characters are therefore defined as 'TO' parameters of the CHANGE com
   You can use options 4 or 5 to view the definitions for the built-in c
   sets.

  %Note:+ The dialog does%not+validate the definitions that you make
   other than verifying that they are non-blank.  If you define a charac
   improperly, you will not get the expected results.  Remember that if
   want an asterisk as a character, you must put it in quotes.  An unquo
   asterisk tells PDF to use the previous 'TO' string.
