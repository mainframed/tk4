+---------------------% COPY and REBLOCK Load Library +-----------------
%
+   COPYMOD function of IEBCOPY is used to reblock a load library from o
+   blocking factor to another (either larger or smaller).  The RLD and
+   control information is also reconstructed during the copy.
+
+   The maximum output blocking factor is 18K, as this is the maximum
+   blocking factor supported by the linkage editor.
+
+   The input library dataset name must be entered following standard IS
+   dataset naming conventions.  If a member name is specified then only
+   that member will be copied.  If the member name specified is '*' the
+   the entire library will copied.  If the member name is not specified
+   then the user will be prompted to specify the desired members to be
+   copied.
+
+   The output library will be allocated if it does not currently exist.
+
+   The assumption is that the DFP version of IEBCOPY is installed.
