   The Primary Option indicates whether the Rockwell Option Panel will
   be treated as a "primary" panel or not. This setting of the panel
   governs what will happen when you enter either RETURN or any 'jump
   command (an option path beginning with an '=' sign).

   When you are operating under an option on the Rockwell Menu and it is
   set to "PRIMARY - YES", RETURN will go to the Rockwell Menu, and any
   '=' commands will jump to an option on the Rockwell Menu. An
   exception is '=X', which will perform an Exit from the Rockwell Menu

   Menu, and an '=X' will leave the ISPF Primary Menu.
