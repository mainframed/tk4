%TUTORIAL ----------- SAVE your Menu/Alias Options Utility ------------
%COMMAND ===>_ZCMD
+
  You can SAVE your definitions of your added displayable menu, hidden m
  options, and all of your instant access options.  This information can
  saved in any of two formats: as a text file or as an ISPF table.

  Since all of the BUILD options are saved in your ISPF profile, you may
  save these definitions elsewhere in case your ISPF profile dataset is
  destroyed.  If any of the following happen to you immediately after de
  your BUILD menu options, then you have lost your BUILD definitions:  a
  error occurs OR you are cancelled from TSO before you have a chance to
  ISPF.

  Your BUILD options are only permanent when you exit ISPF normally afte
  have added them.  After that has been done, being canceled from TSO wi
  cause you to lose your original BUILD added options.

  Options can be reloaded or rebuilt by using the "REBUILD Menu/Alias Op
  Utility.
