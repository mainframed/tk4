LPALINK PROVIDES THE FACILITY TO DYNAMICALLY LOAD MODULES INTO
LPA.  THE LOADING IS ACCOMPLISHED AS FOLLOWS: IEAVLK01 IS
MODIFIED TO CAUSE THE REQUESTED MODULE TO BE LOADED INTO CSA
SUBPOOL 241, INSTEAD OF USER REGION SUBPOOL 251 OR 252.
IEAVLK01 WILL PERFORM THIS SPECIAL LOADING UNDER THE FOLLOWING
CONDITIONS:
  1 - THE REQUESTED MODULE IS MARKED REENTRANT,
  2 - THE REQUESTED MODULE IS AN AUTHORIZED PROGRAM, CONTAINED
      IN AN AUTHORIZED LIBRARY, EXPLICITLY MENTIONED IN THE APF
      LIST IN PARMLIB (IEAAPF00),
  3 - THE PREVIOUS RB ON THE RB CHAIN (AS SEEN BY IEAVLK01) IS
      A PRB POINTING TO A CDE WITH THE NAME SDLODLPA.

TO USE THIS FACILITY, AN AUTHORIZED PROGRAM LINKS TO SDLODLPA,
PASSING A PARAMETER LIST CONTAINING THE FOLLOWING:
  - THE 8 BYTE NAME OF THE MODULE TO BE LOADED,
  - THE 4 BYTE ADDRESS OF AN OPEN DCB FOR THE AUTHORIZED PROGRAM
    LIBRARY FROM WHICH THE MODULE IS TO BE LOADED, OR ZERO IF
    STEPLIB/JOBLIB IS TO BE USED.

SDLODLPA LOADS THE MODULE INTO LPA AND ISSUES A WTO GIVING THE
MODULE NAME AND ENTRY POINT ADDRESS.  THE CDE AND EXTENT LIST
ARE THEN COPIED INTO STORAGE GETMAINED FROM SQA SUBPOOL 245, AND
THE NEW CDE IS INSERTED AT THE HEAD OF THE ALPA QUEUE.  THE USE
COUNT IN THE NEW CDE IS INCREMENTED SO THAT IT REMAINS ON THE
ACTIVE LPA QUEUE.

THE DYNAMICALLY LOADED MODULE RESEMBLES A MEMBER OF MLPA IN
3 WAYS:
  1 - IT IS AUTOMATICALLY A MEMBER OF THE ACTIVE LPA QUEUE,
  2 - IT MAY BE PAGED OUT IF IT IS MODIFIED,
  3 - IT WILL NOT WARM-START, THOUGH IT MAY BE RE-LOADED.

THIS FACILITY IS COMPRISED OF TWO PROGRAMS, LPALINK AND SDLODLPA.

LPALINK IS A DRIVER ROUTINE WHICH PROVIDES THE INTERFACE TO
SDLODLPA AS A BATCH PROGRAM OR STARTED TASK. IT OPENS THE
REQUIRED DCBS, OBTAINS THE REQUESTED MODULE NAME FROM THE
EXEC STATEMENT PARMS, AND LINKS TO SDLODLPA.

SDLODLPA PERFORMS THE ACTUAL LOAD AND SETS UP THE NEW CDE IN
THE ALPA QUEUE.

BOTH OF THESE ROUTINES MUST BE GIVEN AN AUTHORIZATION CODE OF 1,
AND MUST RESIDE IN AN APF AUTHORIZED LIBRARY.

THE JCL REQUIRED FOR LPALINK IS AS FOLLOWS:


//LPALINK PROC MOD=,              NAME OF LOAD MODULE
//  LIB=,                         LIBRARY IN WHICH MODULE RESIDES
//  LODLIB=                       LIBRARY IN WHICH SDLODLPA RESIDES
//LOAD EXEC PGM=LPALINK,PARM=&MOD
//SDLODLPA DD DSN=&LODLIB,DISP=SHR
//MODULE DD DSN=&LIB,DISP=SHR
