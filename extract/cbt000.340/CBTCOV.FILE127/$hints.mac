1. IF YOUR RACF DATA SET (OR ALTERNATE RACF DATA SET) IS UNUSABLE AT IPL
   THE IPL WILL NOT WORK, WHICH CAN BE A PROBLEM. TO AVOID THIS PROBLEM,
   DONE THE FOLLOWING:
   A. HAVE AN ALTERNATE RACF DATA SET, SPECIFIED IN LOAD MODULE
      ICHRDSNT. OURS IS UPDATED AS CHANGES HAPPEN TO THE PRIMARY
      DATA SET, BUT STATISTICS CHANGES ARE NOT MAINTAINED IN THE
      ALTERNATE DATA SET. THE RACF INSTALLATION MANUAL DESCRIBES
      HOW TO SET UP ICHRDSNT. OURS IS INCLUDED AS MEMBER ICHRDSNT IN
      THIS PDS.
   B. ICHRDSNT MUST BE IN A LINK LIST DATA SET, BUT NEED NOT BE IN
      SYS1.LINKLIB. OURS IS IN A DATA SET CALLED SYS1.ICHRDSNT, WHICH
      IS THE LAST DATA SET IN THE LNKLST00 MEMBER OF OUR SYS1.PARMLIB.
      BEING LAST, IT CAUSES NO OVERHEAD PROBLEMS DURING NORMAL LINK
      LIST SEARCHES, AS THE USER IS ABOUT TO GET AN S806 ABEND IF THE
      SEARCH GETS THAT FAR, ANYWAY.
   C. WE HAVE AN ALTERNATE VERSION OF ICHRDSNT, WHICH IS MEMBER
      ICHRDSNU IN THIS PDS. THIS VERSION OF ICHRDSNT IS SET UP TO CAUSE
      A PROMPT FOR THE NAME OF A RACF DATA SET OR 'NONE' AT IPL TIME,
      SO THAT IN AN EMERGENCY WE CAN COME UP USING ONLY ONE OF THE RACF
      DATA SETS, IF ONE OF THEM IS BAD. WE CAN ALSO IPL WITH RACF
      INACTIVE IF NECESSARY.
   D. IF WE HAVE A RACF DATA SET PROBLEM, AND WE NEED TO SPECIFY A
      DIFFERENT DATA SET AT IPL TIME, THEN WE SPECIFY LNK=NR WHEN
      ASKED FOR SYSTEM PARAMETERS, WHICH CAUSES LNKLSTNR TO BE USED
      INSTEAD OF LNKLST00. LNKLSTNR IS A COPY OF LNKLST00 EXCEPT THAT
      THE LAST DATA SET LISTED IS SYS1.ALT.ICHRDSNT INSTEAD OF
      SYS1.ICHRDSNT.  SYS1.ALT.ICHRDSNT CONTAINS THE ALTERNATE VERSION
      OF ICHRDSNT, WHICH LETS US SPECIFY THE NAME OF THE DATA SET TO
      USE.

2. WE USE ICHRAU00 TO LOG INFORMATION TO SMF IN THE SAME FORMAT THAT
   RACF USES, SO THAT THE HOME-GROWN AND IBM-SUPPLIED RACF REPORT
   WRITERS CAN FORMAT THE INFORMATION. THE INTERFACE SEEMS STRANGE TO
   ME, BUT HAS CAUSED NO PROBLEMS. THE CALLER OF ICHRAU00 MUST BE
   APF-AUTHORIZED OR IN SYSTEM KEY OR IN SUPERVISOR STATE. SEE IEFUJV
   OR IKJEFF10 FOR EXAMPLES OF HOW TO DO THIS.
