//***FILE 006 is a tape copy program from the Air Force Finance     *
//*           Center in Denver.  This pgm will copy all files of    *
//*           an input tape to one to sixteen output tapes.  The    *
//*           original purpose of this program was for copying      *
//*           the SHARE MVS Mods Tape.  This program is quite       *
//*           fast.  The name of this program is "COPYMODS".        *
//*                                                                 *
//*           When first written, the intent of this program was    *
//*           to copy NL tapes.  I have modified COPYMODS very      *
//*           extensively, to teach it about Standard Labeled       *
//*           tapes, and have modified it to copy large-blocked     *
//*           files of up to 64K.  (SG 07/00)                       *
//*                                                                 *
//*           I USE THIS PROGRAM FOR CREATING COPIES OF THE CBT     *
//*           MVS UTILITIES TAPE.  (SG 10/93)                       *
//*                                                                 *
//*           This program is useful in making "carbon copies"      *
//*           from one tape to another, and it can also convert     *
//*           from one tape medium to another.  For example, it     *
//*           can convert from reels to cartridges, or vice-versa.  *
//*                                                                 *
//*           My advice is, however, that you should not mix        *
//*           media types when you make multiple output tapes in    *
//*           one run.  For example, //OUT1 and //OUT2 should       *
//*           both be reels, or both cartridges of the same         *
//*           format (like 3480, 3490IDRC, or 3490E).  Do not mix   *
//*           these.  //IN can be different from //OUTx, however.   *
//*           It is my experience that when the //IN (input tape)   *
//*           was of different media type than the //OUTx (output   *
//*           tapes), this program has always worked flawlessly     *
//*           to convert the tape to a different media format.      *
//*                                                                 *
//*           I fixed the COPYMODS program to copy tapes with       *
//*           up to 64K blocks.  I've also added many other fixes,  *
//*           most of them having to do with teaching the program   *
//*           about Standard Labels.                                *
//*                                                                 *
//*           I've also solved the 2-tape-marks-together problem    *
//*           when you have a null SL tape file.  The program will  *
//*           now copy past that point, if it has seen a HDR1 or    *
//*           HDR2 label before the 2 tape marks.                   *
//*                                                                 *
//*           Under PARM control, this program can now copy         *
//*           initted tapes, and optionally change the VOLSER       *
//*           of the copied SL initted tape.  Thus, you can init    *
//*           a large number of tapes at the same time.             *
//*                                                                 *

//*       NEW FEATURES ADDED:                      SBG 07/00        *

//*           1.  64K BLOCKS ON A TAPE CAN BE COPIED.               *
//*                                                                 *

//*           3.  INITTED TAPES, AND SL MULTIVOLUME TAPES CAN       *
//*               BE CORRECTLY COPIED.                              *
//*                                                                 *
//*           4.  ALL STANDARD LABEL INFORMATION, OR ANY            *
//*               PARTICULAR LABEL TYPES, CAN BE PRINTED, IF        *
//*               FOUND ON THE INPUT TAPE.                          *
//*                                                                 *
//*           5.  A FLEXIBLE TABLE-DRIVEN PARM KEYWORD SCANNER      *
//*               WAS ADDED.  THIS ALLOWS FOR EASY SETTING OF       *
//*               PROGRAM DEFAULTS, AND KEYWORD SYNONYMS.  SEE      *
//*               LABEL PARMTABL.                                   *

//*           6.  OPTIONALLY, THE VOLSER OF THE OUTPUT TAPES        *
//*               CAN BE SET TO THE JCL VOLSER, INSTEAD OF THE      *
//*               INPUT TAPE'S VOLSER.                              *
//*                                                                 *
//*           7.  TAPES WITH LEADING TAPE MARKS CAN BE COPIED       *
//*               EITHER AS-IS, OR WITH THE LEADING TAPE MARKS      *
//*               LEFT OFF.                                         *
//*                                                                 *
//*           8.  EOV LABELS IN THE MIDDLE OF A TAPE, CAN NOW BE    *
//*               CHANGED TO EOF LABELS, IF THE TAPE WAS CREATED    *
//*               AS A COMPOSITE, BY THE COPYFILE PROGRAM.  THE     *
//*               PARM IS EOV2EOF (SEE PARMTABL FOR ALL ACCURATE    *
//*               AND CURRENT PARM KEYWORD SETTINGS).               *
//*                                                                 *
//*           9.  COPYMODS CAN NOW BE RUN READ-ONLY FOR THE INPUT   *
//*               TAPE, USING PARMS OF READ, READONLY, OR NOWRITE.  *
//*                                                                 *
