   FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN YOU CHANGE THE%OWNER+FOR A RESOURCE, NO CHECK IS
   MADE TO INSURE THAT THE%OWNER+ IS A VALID USER OR GROUP UNTIL THE %RA
   COMMAND IS ISSUED. IF IT IS INCORRECT, %RACF+ WILL PROMPT YOU.

   CERTAIN %RACF+COMMANDS HAVE BEEN INTENTIONALLY LEFT OUT OF THE INTERF
   IN MANY CASES THIS WAS BECAUSE THE FEATURE IS NOT CURRENTLY IN USE BY
   MILLER AND IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT IT WILL BE IN THE NEAR FUTURE. FOR
   EXAMPLE, THERE IS NO SUPPORT FOR VOLUME MANIPUTLATION FOR THE TAPEVOL
   CLASS. WITH THE %MILLER/RACF TAPE SUPPORT+ THE CLASS OF TAPEVOL WILL
   ALWAYS BE EMPTY. OTHER COMMANDS, SUCH AS SETROPTS ARE SO INFREQUENTLY
   USEDS, THAT AN%SPF/RACF+INTERFACE WAS NOT WARRANTED. THE DESIGN OF
   THE INTERFACE IS SUCH THAT ANY OF THESE FUNCTIONS COULD EASILY BE
   ADDED AT A LATER DATE IF NEEDED.
