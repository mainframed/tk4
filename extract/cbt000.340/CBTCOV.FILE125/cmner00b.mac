   THE%SPF/RACF+INTERFACE WAS WRITTEN TO PROVIDE A CONVENIENT WAY
   OF EXECUTING MOST COMMON%RACF+COMMANDS. THE INTERFACE WAS DESIGNED
   TO USE THE DIALOG MANAGER AND REQUIRES NO MODIFCATIONS TO%RACF+.

   MOST OF THE FUNTIONS ARE IMPLEMENTED BY BUILDING THE APPROPRIATE%RACF
   COMMAND AND USING AN SPF SUBROUTINE (ISPCAT) TO ATTACH THE COMMAND.
   BEFORE THE COMMAND IS ISSUED, APF AUTHORIZATION IS GAINED BY ISSUING
   A USER SVC. AUTHORIZATION IS REMOVED WHEN THE COMMAND COMPLETES.
   THIS TECHNIQUE ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR MUCH OF THE AUTHORIZATION
   CHECKING IN THE SPF FUNCTION. WHEN THE COMMAND IS ISSUED,%RACF+
   CHECKS WHETHER THE USER HAS THE PROPER AUTHORITY. IN ADDITION,
   BECAUSE OF THIS TECHNIQUE THERE ARE VERY FEW VALIDITY CHECKS IN
   THE SPF FUNCTION.
