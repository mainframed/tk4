00000040WRITE     THE COMMAND PROCEDURES IN THIS DATASET HAVE BEEN SELECTED
00000050WRITE FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS:
00000060WRITE
00000070WRITE A) THEY MIGHT PROVE USEFUL TO SOMEONE ELSE.
00000080WRITE B) SOME CONTAIN TECHNIQUES DEVELOPED OVER SEVERAL YEARS WHICH
00000090WRITE    OTHERS MIGHT NOT HAVE DISCOVERED.
00000100WRITE C) SOME CONTAIN INTERESTING OR HUMOROUS INFORMATION.
00000110WRITE D) MOST WERE FUN TO WRITE, AND I AM HOPING TO STIMULATE
00000120WRITE    INTEREST IN COMMAND PROCEDURE WRITING AS AN ART FORM.
00000130WRITE E) I AM HOPING THAT PERHAPS THERE ARE OTHER INSTALLATIONS
00000140WRITE    WITH CLISTS THAT THEY ARE WILLING TO INCLUDE IN THIS
00000150WRITE    COLLECTION.
00000160WRITE
00000170WRITE      THESE COMMAND PROCEDURES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED UNDER
00000180WRITE MVS 3.7 (PUT 7811), INCLUDING SU11 - THE TSO COMMAND PACKAGE.
00000190WRITE SEVERAL OF THEM ARE DEPENDANT UPON OTHERS - HOWEVER THEY WILL
00000200WRITE RUN IF THE ENTIRE LIBRARY IS ALLOCATED TO SYSPROC - WITH THE
00000210WRITE FOLLOWING EXCEPTION: MEMBER "PFKEYS" IS AN ECHO CLIST TESTING
00000220WRITE THE KOMM COMMAND. KOMM MAY BE FOUND ON THE CBT MODS TAPE.
00000230WRITE
00000240WRITE COMMENTS: IN CERTAIN TABLE DEFINITIONS, A NUMERIC STRING WILL
00000250WRITE CONTAIN EITHER A BLANK OR AN "X". THIS TO CIRCUMVENT A PROBLEM
00000260WRITE THAT AROSE WITH SU11. THE CLIST PROCESSOR INSISTS UPON EVALUATING
00000270WRITE NUMERIC STRINGS, AND THEN GENERATING AN ERROR. THE EXTRA CHARACTER
00000280WRITE FORCES DATATYPE TO "CHAR".
00000290WRITE      SEVERAL OF THE CLISTS ARE DESIGNED TO RUN UNDER TSO EDIT
00000300WRITE ONLY. THEY WON'T WORK FROM READY.
00000310WRITE      IT WOULD BEHOOVE ONE TO READ THE COMMENTS (AND EVEN THE CODE)
00000320WRITE PRIOR TO INVOKING THE COMMAND. CAVEAT EMPTOR.
00000330WRITE      MANY OF THE CLISTS HAVE "HELP" BUILT INTO THEM. READ MEMBER
00000340WRITE "BLDHELP" FOR EXPLANATION OF HOW THIS WORKS.
00000350WRITE      REGARDING "BLDHELP" AND "BLDJCL", THESE WERE DEVELOPED FOR
00000360WRITE A MULTI-ACCESS SPOOL ENVIRONMENT. THEY AVOID VOLUME RESERVE
00000370WRITE PROBLEMS AND ARE ADMITTEDLY A DATASET INTEGRITY EXPOSURE. WE
00000380WRITE ARE STILL IN THE PROCESS OF CLOSING THIS EXPOSURE.
00000390WRITE
00000400WRITE =>  I WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE ANY COMMENTS, CRITICISMS, OR
00000410WRITE     ADDITIONS REGARDIN THIS STUFF. I AM A MEMBER OF THE TSO
00000420WRITE     PROJECT, AND CHAIRMAN OF THA "RATSO" COMMITTEE. ANY
00000430WRITE     CORRESPONDENCE SHOULD BE ADDRESSED TO:
