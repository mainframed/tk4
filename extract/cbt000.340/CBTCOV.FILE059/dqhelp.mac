)F FUNCTION -
             DISPLAY STATUS OF JOBS IN JES2 JOB QUEUES

             JOBS WHICH MATCH THE USERID (PLUS ADDITIONAL
             CHARACTERS) ARE DISPLAYED.  THE USER MAY OVERRIDE
             THIS DEFAULT AND ENTER A NEW STRING AS AN OPERAND.
             AN * MAY BE SPECIFIED TO SELECT ALL JOBS.

             FOR EACH SELECTED JOB, THE JOBNAME,
             JES2 JOB NUMBER, CLASS, QUEUE POSITION, AND
             NUMBER OF JOBS HELD UP TO AND INCLUDING THE
             DISPLAYED JOB IS DISPLAYED.  AN INDICATOR IS
             DISPLAYED IF THE JOB IS HELD.

             FOR JOBS IN EXECUTION, THE STEP NAME AND PROCEDURE
             STEP NAME FOR THE CURRENT STEP IS DISPLAYED.

             FOR JOBS AWAITING OUTPUT, ONLY "OUT" IS SHOWN.
             THE OUTPUT CLASS IS NOT INDICATED NOR IS A DATA SET
             IN A HELD OUTPUT CLASS INDICATED.

             SINCE THE JES2 CHECKPOINT RECORD WHICH RESIDES
             ON DISK MUST BE ALLOCATED AND READ, EXCESSIVE
             USE OF THIS COMMAND CAN CAUSE PERFORMANCE DEGRADATION
             FOR BOTH TSO AND JES2.  A REASONABLE TIME SHOULD
             BE ALLOWED TO ELAPSE BETWEEN COMMAND EXECUTIONS.

                     IS FOUND, THE JOB IS DISPLAYED.  IF A
                     JOBNAME IS LONGER THAN THE JOBID, BUT
                     CONTAINS THE JOBID IN THE INITIAL CHARACTERS,
                     IT IS CONSIDERED A MATCH.

                     IF AN * IS ENTERED, ALL JOBS ARE DISPLAYED.
