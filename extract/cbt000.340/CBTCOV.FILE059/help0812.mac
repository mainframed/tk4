=FIND=F
)F FUNCTION
               SEARCH AN ADDRESS RANGE FOR A SPECIFIED VALUE AND
               DISPLAY THE LOCATION OF THE FIRST CHARACTER OF THE
               STRING.

               THE FIND SUBCOMMAND OF TEST MAY BE USED TO LOCATE A
               SPECIFIC DATA STRING IN A PROGRAM BEING TESTED.  THE
               USER MUST SPECIFY AN ADDRESS RANGE WHERE THE STRING IS
               TO BE LOCATED AND A STRING OF DATA TO BE FOUND.  THE
               ADDRESS RANGE MAY BE SPECIFIED IN ANY FORM ACCEPTABLE
               TO TEST.  THE STRING TO BE LOCATED MUST BE SPECIFIED
               AS A DATA-TYPE AND VALUE.

               THE ADDRESS RETURNED IS ALWAYS AN ABSOLUTE ADDRESS.

               THE ENTIRE STRING MUST BE CONTAINED WITHIN THE ADDRESS
               RANGE SPECIFIED.

               ADDRESS-RANGE
                    SPECIFIES THE ADDRESSES BETWEEN WHICH THE SEARCH
                    IS TO BE PERFORMED.  SEE DESCRIPTION OF THE TEST
                    COMMAND FOR VALID ADDRESS FORMATS.  THIS OPERAND
                    MUST BE ENTERED AS A RANGE.

               DATA-TYPE'VALUE'
                    SPECIFIES THE TYPE OF DATA AND THE VALUE THAT IS
                    TO BE FOUND.  THE TYPE OF DATA IS INDICATED BY A
                    TYPE CODE CHARACTER.

                    THE VALUE IS ENTERED FOLLOWING THE CODE.  THE
                    DATA MUST BE ENCLOSED WITHIN APOSTROPHES.  ANY
                    SINGLE APOSTROPHES WITHIN THE DATA MUST BE CODED
                    AS TWO SINGLE APOSTROPHES.  CHARACTER DATA IS
                    ENTERED AS IS; ALL OTHER DATA TYPES WILL BE
                    TRANSLATED TO UPPERCASE (IF NECESSARY).

                    VALID DATA TYPES, TYPE CODES, MAXIMUM LENGTH,
                    LIMIT VALUES, AND ALLOWABLE CHARACTERS ARE
                    DEFINED BY THE FOLLOWING TABLE:

                    MAXIMUM LENGTH INCLUDES ONE CHARACTER FOR A SIGN
                    FOR DATA TYPES WHERE A SIGN IS VALID.  THE
                    NUMERIC PORTION HAS A MAXIMUM LENGTH OF ONE LESS
                    THAN THE VALUE SHOWN.

))ALL               SPECIFIES THAT ALL OCCURRENCES OF THE SEARCH
                    STRING WITHIN THE SPECIFIED RANGE ARE TO BE
                    IDENTIFIED.  IF ALL IS NOT SPECIFIED, PROCESSING
                    TERMINATES AFTER THE FIRST OCCURRENCE IS FOUND.
