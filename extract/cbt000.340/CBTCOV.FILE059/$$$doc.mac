1                         TABLE OF CONTENTS

 THE FORMAT IS ONE PDS

 SYSTEMS WHICH SUPPORT EXECUTION OF THE TMP IN THE BACKGROUND WILL
 SUPPORT DVOL, DSN, DENQ, AND DSAT (EXCEPT PDS OPTION) UNDER THE TMP
 AS BATCH JOBS.

 MVS SYSTEMS WHICH ALSO SUPPORT BACKGROUND DYNAMIC ALLOCATION WILL
 SUPPORT ALL OF THE TSO COMMANDS UNDER THE TMP AS BATCH JOBS.

 THE SOURCE FOR DSAT, DVOL, DSN/DENQ, AND FREEALL IS OPERATING
 SYSTEM DEPENDENT.  THE PROPER OPERATING SYSTEM MUST BE SPECIFIED
 AS THE VALUE FOR &OPSYSTM BEFORE ASSEMBLING.  THE REMAINING
 PROGRAMS ARE OPERATING SYSTEM INDEPENDENT (MVT-SVS-MVS).

 THE MVT ASSEMBLER F WILL NOT ASSEMBLE SOME OF THE MACROS PROPERLY.
 THE SVS AND MVS ASSEMBLER XF, THE H ASSEMBLER, AND SOME VERSIONS OF
 THE G ASSEMBLER WILL ASSEMBLE THE MACROS WITHOUT ERROR.  THE F
 ASSEMBLER DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THE &SYSDATE AND &SYSTIME SYSTEM
 VARIABLE SYMBOLS IN THE $ENTER MACRO AND DOES NOT ALLOW THE MNOTE
 STATEMENT BEFORE THE LOCAL AND GLOBAL SYMBOL DEFINITIONS IN
 SEVERAL OF THE MACROS.

 THE FOLLOWING IS A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE MEMBERS IN THIS PDS.

 MORE DETAILED DOCUMENTION IS INCLUDED IN COMMENT STATEMENTS
 IN EACH SOURCE PROGRAM AND MACRO.

 THE DATE SHOWN UNDER UPDATE IS THE DATE THE MODULE WAS ADDED TO
 THE DISTRIBUTION TAPE OR THE DATE OF THE MOST RECENT CHANGE.
