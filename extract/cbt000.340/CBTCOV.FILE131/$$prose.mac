                     -----------------------------------

                   THIS IS A COLLECTION OF BATCH UTILTITY PGMS. MY
                   INTENT IS TO PUT TOGETHER A FILE OF THESE PGMS FOR
                   SHARE. SOME ARE ORIGINAL AND MOST WERE OBTAINED FROM
                   OUR OS/MVT DAYS AND CONVERTED. IT IS EMBARRASSING TO
                   TELL MANAGEMENT THAT USERS HAVE LOST FUNCTION MIGRAT-
                   ING TO MVS AND ALL OF ITS WONDERS. HOPEFULLY I CAN
                   DONATE SOME OF THESE HANDY UTILITIES TO OTHERS WHO
                   WERE NOT LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE AN IBM 360 WITH OS/MVT
                   ALOT WAS DEVELOPED FOR OS/MVT AND MUCH OF IT IS STILL
                   APPLICABLE.

           10 OCT 86 - AS I CHECK OUT THE DIFFERENT PGMS ON AN MVS/XA
                       SYSTEM I WILL NOTE IT IN THE REL FIELD. MY
                       SCHEME OF THINGS IS AS FOLLOWS:
                       X     - CHECKED OUT ON MVS/XA
                       Y     - RUNS ONLY MVS/SP AND I WILL NOT PURSUE
                               THE CHANGES TO MVS/XA, YOU CAN DO IT
                               AND I WOULD APPRECIATE THE CODE IF SO.
                               (MAY WORK IN MVS/SP, YOU CAN TRY).
                       N     - ONLY RUNS IN MVS/SP, NEEDS CONVERSION
                       Z     - RUNS NOW IN MVS/XA BUT WAS CONVERTED
                               AND IF YOU WANT IT TO WORK IN MVS/SP
                               YOU NEED TO LOOK IN CODE AND CHANGE A
                               CONDITIONAL ASSEMBLY.
                       BLANK - NEEDS TO BE DETERMINED, WILL GET TO IT

                         12X12 BLOCK LETTERS UP TO 8 ACROSS THE PAGE
                         AND FOUR BLOCK LINES PER PAGE.

          BLOKHF    1X   FORTRAN INTERFACE MODULE SO YOU CAN CALL
                         'BLOKHD' FROM FORTRAN CODE.

          BLOKLTR   1X   FORTRAN PGM THAT PRODUCES BLOCK LETTERS ONE
                         PER PAGE (SIDEWAYS).

          BLOKPDS   1X   TAKES A SEQUENTIAL SOURCE FILE CREATED BY
                         UTIL 'LISTPDS' AND CREATES A PRINT FILE WITH
                         12X12 BLOCK LETTERS BEFORE EACH MEMBER IN THE
                         LISTING. GREAT FOR WHEN YOU PUT SOURCE ON
                         MICROFICHE. SEE DOC IN CODE.

          CATLIST   1    THIS PROGRAM IS FROM MIKE LOOS, DELUXE CHK
                         PRINTERS. THIS WILL DO A VERY FAST LIST OF
                         AN ICF CATALOG FOR GDG'S AND NONVSAM DSNS.
                         LISTING IS IN THE SAME FORMAY AS IDCAMS
                         (WE USED IT TO BUILD A TMC) BUT THE OUTPUT
                         FORMAT WOULD BE VERY EASY TO CHANGE. SEE
                         COMMEMTS IN THE CODE FOR AN EXPLANATION
                         OF ITS SPEED AND RELATION TO RACF.

                         R2D2 NEEDS A TASK OF SOME KIND GOING TO BUMP
                         THE SRB OFF OF. MOST PEOPLE HAVE BEEN USING
                         #CMD SUBSYSTEM AND SOME OTHER BRAVE SOLES,
                         JES2. PLUS NOW C3PO WILL TALK TO YOU IF YOU
                         WANT. ANYONE WANTS TO INCREASE HIS VOCABULARY
                         IS WELCOME. HAVE NOT INSTALLED IT THIS WAY
                         BUT WILL WHEN I GO TO MVS/SP1.3.

          C3PO2     1Y   SAME AS ABOVE, BUT WITH A STIMER IN IT FOR
                         PEOPLE WHO DO NOT WNAT TO RUN C3PO WITH
