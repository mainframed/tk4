*     THE ISPF "SMOKE AND MIRRORS" MODIFICATION TAPE IS BROUGHT TO
*     YOU FROM THE "SHARE" ISPF PROJECT.  THIS TAPE IS AN ATTEMPT TO

*     DISCUSSED, SPOKEN AT SHARE, AND LOOSELY DISTRUBUTED TO SOME.
*
*     THIS TAPE IS BEING PROVIDED TO FOSTER THE GOOD THINGS WHICH
*     ISPF/PDF CAN DO THROUGH EXAMPLES OF WORKING SYSTEMS.  THIS
*     MUTAL SHARING OF CODE WILL HELP EDUCATE US ALL AND BENEFIT OUR
*     INSTALLATIONS.

*
*     PRESENTLY PAUL BANKS AND MYSELF ARE WORKING OUT SOME SORT OF
*     ARRANGEMENT FOR PEOPLE TO OBTAIN THE TAPE.  THERE MAY BE A SMALL
*     FEE INVOLVED TO COVER THE COST OF COPYING, HANDLING, POSTAGE,
*     ETC.  WE WANTED TO GET THE TAPE OUT TO THE WORLD AS SOON AS
*     POSSIBLE TO GET PEOPLE'S SUBMISSIONS AND BEGIN TO BUILD A
*     COLLECTION OF THE "NEAT AND NIFTY" ISPF THINGS PEOPLE HAVE
*     ACCOMPLISHED.  WE HOPE TO HAVE THE DETAILS WORKED OUT BY THE
*     ANAHEIM SHARE, FEBRUARY 1994.
*
*     PEOPLE WHO CONTRIBUTE TO THE TAPE CAN RECEIVE A FULL COPY OF THE
*     TAPE AT NO CHARGE, FOR MAKING THE EFFORT.  FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
*     WORKERS SHOULD CONTACT ME PERSONALLY, JIM MARSHALL, 202-874-8353
*     TO DISCUSS HOW WE CAN GET YOU A TAPE AT NO CHARGE.
*
*     USERS WHO "JUST GOTTA HAVE A COPY" WITH NO CONTRIBUTION TO START,
*     SHOULD CALL ME.  I PLAN TO KEEP SOME RECORDS OF WHO AND WHERE
*     TAPES ARE SHIPPED.  MAYBE SOMEONE NEAR TO YOU HAS GOTTEN A TAPE
*     AND WOULD GIVE YOU A COPY.
*
*     HOPE TO SEE ALL OF YOU AT THE ANAHEIM SHARE IN 1994.

*
*     THE ISPF IS CONSTRUCTED AS A MULTIPLE FILE NON-LABELED TAPE. THE
*     TAPE IS PRIMARILY INTENDED FOR A MVS/TSO ENVIRONMENT.  BUT THE
*     TAPE MIGHT BE USEFUL TO VM (THE OTHER OPERATING SYSTEM) USERS.
*     THE DATA FILES ARE BUILT AS SOURCE FILES. IT WAS FIRST THOUGHT TO
*     BUILD THE CONTRIBUTION FILES USING IEBCOPY "UNLOADED" FORMAT.
*     IF DONE, THEN OUR VM BROTHERS/SISTERS WOULD NOT HAVE ACCESS TO
*     OUR GOOD STUFF;  TSO PIGS ARE A THOUGHTFUL LOT.
*
*     THE FIRST FILE IS DOCUMENTATION BUILT AS A CARD IMAGE, SEQUENTIAL
*     FILE.  THE SECOND FILE IS AN IEBCOPY UNLOADED PDS OF PROGRAMS
*     TO BE USED BY MVS/TSO'ERS TO EASILY EXPLODE EACH CONTRIBUTION
*     FILE (THIS WHOLE FILE SHOULD BE SKIPPED BY VM'ERS).
*
*     FILE 3 IS BEING RESERVED FOR LATER USE.
*
*     FILES 4-N ARE IN IBM'S IEBUPDTE "./" FORMAT WITH ONE MEMBER
*     FOR PANELS, ONE MEMBER FOR SKELETONS, ONE MEMBER FOR CLISTS,
*     ETC.  EACH FILE ALSO HAS A $README MEMBER.  THIS MEMBER IS
*     IN THIS FILE BELOW.
*
*     INTERNAL TO EACH MEMBER WILL BE MULTIPLE MEMBERS, EACH
*     PRECEDED BY " >< ADD " WHICH LOOK VERY SIMILAR TO " ./ ADD "
*     IEBUPDTE FORMAT.  THE 'PDSLOAD' UTILITY FROM BILL GODFREY,
*     PLANNING RESEARCH CORP, MCCLEAN, VA IS INCLUDED.  WHEN
*     EXPLODING EACH PDS MEMBER INTO A SEPARATE PDS, PDSLOAD
*     WILL AUTOMATICALLY CONVERT THE "><" TO "./" AND RESTORE THE
*     ISPF STATISTICS IF THE PDS WAS CREATED BY THE LISTPDS OR
*     OFFLOAD (ENHANCED VERSION SOON TO BE INCLUDED IN FILE2)
*     UTILITIES.
*
*     FOR THOSE WHO ARE INTO GOOD THINGS, THE "LISTPDS" UTILITY,
*     COMPLETE WITH DOCUMENTATION, HAS BEEN INCLUDED TO SHOW ONE
*     HOW TO UNLOAD A PDS INTO IEBUPDTE "./ ADD" FORMAT AND
*     ADDITIONALLY PRESERVE THE ISPF STATISTICS.  AGAIN, MANY
*     THANKS TO BILL AND THE MODIFICATIONS HE PUT INTO THE LISTPDS
*     UTILITY FROM THE GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER, GREENBELT, MD.
*     IT IS NOT NEEDED TO RETRIEVE THINGS FROM THIS TAPE BUT WAS
*     INCLUDED FOR OTHER USES YOU MAY FIND.
*
*     HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE STEPS NECESSARY TO RETRIEVE FILE 15.
*
*     1. READ THIS FILE.
*
*     2. IEBCOPY LOAD FILE=(2,NL) INTO A PDS.
*
*     3. INSTALL PDSLOAD PROGRAM INTO A LOADLIB.  THE PROGRAM
*        AND DOCUMENTATION (SEE THE CODE), PLUS JCL TO INSTALL,
*        IS IN FILE 2.  PLUS EXECUTION JCL SAMPLES.
*
*     4. FOR OUR EXAMPLE, USE FILE=(15,NL) INTO IEBUPDTE (OR
*        PDSLOAD WITH NO PARM PASSED) TO CREATE A PDS.  IF YOU
*        CHOOSE TO USE IEBUPDTE, YOU PROBABLY WANT TO "DUMMY"
*        SYSPRINT.
*
*     5. NOW THE PDS CONTAINS MEMBERS CALLED 'PANELS',
*        'SKELETONS', 'SYSPROC', ETC.
*
*     6. USE PDSLOAD WITH PARM='><' TO EXPLODE EACH MEMBER INTO
*        A SEPARATE DATA SET; ONE PDS FOR PANELS, ONE PDS FOR
*        SKELETONS, ONE PDS FOR CLISTS (SYSPROC), ETC.
*
*     7. IF YOU ARE STILL CONFUSED, CALL ME.   JIM MARSHALL
*                                              202-874-8353

Installation:
  Use IEBUPDTE on EXEC into your SYSPROC or SYSEXEC library
  Use IEBUPDTE on PANELS into your ISPPLIB
  Use IEBUPDTE on SKELS  into your ISPSLIB

Brief Documentaiton:

The ISPF Edit SPELL macro has been enhanced. SPELL verifies the spelling
words in a document by invoking SCRIPT/VS.

To use it, simply enter:
     COMMAND ===> SPELL

For additional information, enter:
     COMMAND ===> SPELL ?

The new version incorporates the following new features:

o Uncataloged and VIO data sets are now supported.

o Documents greater than 80 bytes wide should no longer cause errors.

o Documents with SCRIPT control words should no longer cause errors.

o All special (nonalphanumeric) characters are now treated as SCRIPT
  word delimiters, except for single quote marks and hyphens, which are
  treated as SCRIPT punctuation characters.  That is, words containing
  single quotes or hyphens will be verified (e.g., can't, built-in).
  Words containing numeric characters are not verified (i.e., will not
  cause errors).

o BookMaster GML tags and their attributes will no longer cause errors.
  The attributes are not examined for correctness.  Unrecognized tags
  are still considered erroneous.

o You may have your own personal spelling dictionary to supplement those
  built in to SCRIPT/VS. Specify:
       COMMAND ===> SPELL Dictionary

  A panel will be displayed with instructions.

o All potentially misspelled words will be displayed in a table.  There
  will be one row per uniquely misspelled word, along with a count of
  the number of times that word was found. The table may be sorted by
  order of first occurrence in the text, by the number of times the word
  was found, or alphabetically. Line commands allow you to:

    . add correctly spelled words to your personal spelling dictionary;
    . correct all occurrences of a word in the text;
    . exclude words which are correct or of no interest.

o Adding, correcting, or excluding words affects the following
  messages:

o Messages are inserted above the first line of text stating how many
  words on how many lines were misspelled, and how many uniquely
  misspelled words were found.

o A list of uniquely misspelled words is inserted just after the above
  messages. This is the same list displayed in the above table, minus
  any words which have been removed from the table.  The list is
  compacted onto as few lines as possible.  The words are in the order
  of first occurrence in the text.

o A message is inserted just above each line containing a misspelled
  word.  The message contains all misspelled words on that line, aligned
  with the corresponding words in the line. You may correct a word by
  overtyping it or by using the CHANGE command.

o All error free lines are excluded, making it easy to find errors.

    This file contains the Rockwell front-end to IBM's BookManager
    Read/MVS and is provided with not guarentee.  If you use it you
    should review it completely so that you understand it before
    installing for production use.

>>>Overview.

The IBM BookManager Read/MVS product is intended to display lists of sof
publications and then individual softcopy publications.  It provides a 3
hierarchy (Library Shelf -> Shelf -> Book).

The Rockwell front-end provides an unlimited (but not to exceed in total
levels via a replacement for the Library Shelf known as Categories.  Cat
may be nested and within a Category a Shelf, Book or sub-Category may be
defined.  The IBM Read/MVS is invoked when a user selects either a Shelf
Book for processing.

There are two (2) elements to this front-end, a User Application and an
Administrative Application which are described below.

Access restrictions are build into the application using information
extracted by a Rockwell unique routine to extract the users department
from our ACF2 data base.

This application is written using TSO/E REXX and ISPF dialog elements.

>>>Installation.

This file contains the following members:

   $README     What you are reading
   DOC         Some documentation on the application that our Tech Pubs
               staff uses.
   EXEC        REXX execs used by the dialog
   MSGS        ISPF Messages
   PANELS      ISPF Panels
   SKELS       ISPF Skeleton
   TABLE       Sample application tables

Each member, other than this one and DOC, are in IEBUPDTE format.  Load
the EXEC member into your SYSPROC or SYSEXEC library (you may need to
change the members from FB,80 to VB,255).  The IEBUPDTE members have wit
them a +/ which should be changed to ./ and then those members should
be processed using IEBUPDTE one more time to place them into their
correct libraries.

>>>User Applications.

The user interface to BookManager Read/MVS will be via the
SOFTPUB exec instead of the BOOKMGR clist.  This is simplified by the ad
of a command to the ISPF Command table (documented below).

Command syntax from the ISPF command line is:

   BOOKMAN  option

   where option is:   null for the normal display of all categories that
                      user is authorized to view.

           DEfault to display the DEFAULT Category

           PRivate to display the users private shelf
           OWn is an alias of Private

           FInd xxx   - find the character string in the primary list
           DFind xxx  - find the character string in the default list


>>>Administration Applications.

   4.  Dialog Elements

1. Overview

   This administration application is written to support the locally
   developed ISPF front-end interface to the IBM BookManager Read/MVS
   product.  It is written using standard ISPF services and is driven
   using procedures written in TSO/E REXX.

   The Rexx procedure SOFTPDFT contains variables that define the
   high-level qualifier for the softcopy application and the names of th
   production and build control data sets.  The control data sets are
   partitioned and contain text and ISPF tables.

2. Administration Applications

   This application is intended to be used by selected individuals to
   define and control the Softcopy Publications environment.  The follow
   options are available as part of this application:

   1+ Build            Build the Softcopy ISPF Tables

      This application will take the BUILD member of the Softcopy
      Work ISPF Table data set and construct a set of ISPF tables
      that are used by the SOFTPUB application that is the front-end
      to the IBM provided BookManager/Read MVS application.

      The BUILD will copy the BUILD member into a member name MASTER
      and rename previous MASTER members as OMASTnnn for future
      reference.

      Table Name "SOFTCOPY" is the primary ISPF table that defines the
      hierarchy of softcopy categories.  Sub-tables are of the format
      SFTggnnn, where 'gg' is a generation qualifier so that COPY can
      be performed without impacting a currently active user.  'nnn'
      is a sequential number starting with 001 for each category
      defined.

   2+ Review           Review Contents of Softcopy ISPF Tables

      A simple ISPF and Rexx application to just display the work
      control data set tables.  Simplier than the Test option to just
      review what has been defined and built.

   3+ Test             Test the built tables

      This option will invoke the softcopy Display application using
      a special parm that causes it to use the Work ISPF table data
      set.

   4+ Copy             Copy the built tables into Production

      This option copies the current tables from the BUILD work data
      set into the production data set.  Current minus 2 versions of
      the tables are also removed.  Member GG is replaced which
      defines the current generation of tables.

   5+ Update Shelf     Update a Book Shelf (Edit)

      Using ISPF Edit update a book shelf and then once the shelf
      has been saved it is transmitted to the other softcopy
      centers using MVS/BDT.


   6+ Collect          Collect a report of all Book Shelves for use in 5

      This option will list all data sets under the defined high-level
      index.  From this list all Book Shelves (.BKSHELF) are checked for

      -  If the second qualifier is UPLOAD then the index file is
         checked and the .BKSHELF is updated to reflect the correct
         dsname for the index.  All Book names are also updated with
         the correct index and suffix and the correct control
         statement inserted into the .BKSHELF.
      -  The title of the shelf is extracted and saved along with
         the dsname in member REPORT of the work control data set.
      -  Prior to saving the REPORT member, the previous REPORT member
         is processed and compared to find any new book shelves.  If
         new shelves are found then member NEWSHELF is created with
         just the new shelves.  This member can then be copied into
         member BUILD under the Construct option.

   7+ Update           Update the BUILD control member

      Invokes ISPF Edit on the work control data set to allow the
      administrator to update the BUILD member with new shelves from
      member NEWSHELF - or to change the current BUILD member
      structure.

   8+ Index Build      Invoke BookManager Read/MVS Index Utility

      Invoke the IBM provided Book Manager Read/MVS Index creation
      utility.

   9+ Usage Report     Generate Softcopy Usage Reports

      This option will generate a series of report files that
      identify all softcopy files that are (1) installed,
      (2) referenced, and (3) unreferenced.  A DCF tag'd file
      is prepared with all referenced file names for reporting
      and a REXX procedure is generated to delete all unreferenced
      files.

  10+ Bulk Xmit        Transmit a 1 or more files to other centers

      Allow the Softcopy administrator to transmit one or more data sets
      to the other softcopy centers using MVS/BDT.


>>>Book Upload Instructions.

  All softcopy elements must be uploaded using the following defaults:

  File    Data     DCB                  Dsname
  Type    Type     Recfm Lrecl Blksize  Format
  ---------------------------------------------------------------
  Shelf   Text     VB    256   6233     ABOOK.UPLOAD.name.BKSHELF
  Book    Binary   FB   4096   8192     ABOOK.name.BOOK
  Index   Binary   FB   4096   8192     ABOOK.name.BKINDEX

  Using TCP/IP FTP:
  ftp mvs-host-name
  ..enter your userid when prompted
  ..enter your password when prompted
  >cd 'abook'
  >nmap $1.$2 UPLOAD.$1.BKSHELF
  >mput *.bks
  >nmap $1.$2 $1.BOOK
  >binary
  >site recfm=fb,lrecl=4096,blksize=8192 pri=300 sec=300 tr
  >mput *.boo
  >nmap $1.$2 $1.BKINDEX
  >mput *.bki
  >quit

  Note that some Books and Book Indexes may exceed the default file
  allocation size.  In this case it is easier to preallocate the data
  set using ISPF and then the upload will use that allocation.

>>>Dialog Elements

ISPF Commands:      The following commands must be added to the
                    ISPCMDS command table by the ISPF administrator:

The ISPF STORage command displays main storage in your address space.
The command has been enhanced to support a Find command. The syntax is:

     Find string <NEXT|PREV> <CHARs|PREfix|SUFfix|WORD>

The parameters all function the same as the Find command under ISPF
Browse. In particular, "string" may be a simple string, a quoted string,
a Character string, a Picture string, a heXadecimal string, or an
asterisk (*). See the Browse tutorial for more information on the Find
command.

The STORAGE command tutorial may be viewed by pressing your HELP key
while under the STORAGE application, or by entering:

     Command ===> STORage ?

The tutorial has confused some people. It is implemented as a single
scrollable panel, rather than as a set of several panels. The easiest
way to view the entire tutorial is the same as a tutorial with multiple
panels:  simply press ENTER to view each panel/page.

The tutorial program, ISPTUTOR, has always interpreted the scroll
commands in a way which is different from the rest of ISPF:

    UP    (PF7/PF19)  displays a higher level tutorial panel.
    DOWN  (PF8/PF20)  skips to the next tutorial topic panel.
    RIGHT (PF10/PF22) displays the next tutorial panel, or scrolls a
                      scrollable panel to the next page. This is the
                      same as pressing ENTER.
    LEFT  (PF11/PF23) displays the previous tutorial panel, or scrolls
                      a scrollable panel to the previous page.

 Note: use of the RFIND command requires entries in the ISPCMDS table
 in file ISPTLIB in the following order:

 VERB     T  ACTION
                DESCRIPTION
 RFIND    0  &USRRFIND
                Repeat FIND

This file contains the following members:

$DOC    -  what you are reading
CLIST   -  Copy this member into your clist library as member PREP
           (use this member only if you do not have REXX)
EXEC    -  Copy this member into your REXX exec library as member PREP
MSGS    -  Copy this member into your ISPF messages library as member PR
PANELS  -  Copy this member into your ISPF panels library as member PREP

Both a CLIST and a REXX version are provided of this dialog for those wh
currently do not have REXX installed.  It is also a good comparison of
how to do the same thing in CLIST vs. REXX.

This file contains a much improved approach for using the IBM ISPPREP
utility to preprocess ISPF panels.  It is best installed as an ISPF
command in the ISPCMDS table:

    VERB    T    ACTION

This data set is in IEBUPDTE format and must be loaded into a
partitioned data set (recfm=FB,lrecl=80,blksize=80*n).  Each member is
an IEBUPDTE stream with the './' changed to '+/' for purposes of this
unload and transfer.

This data set contains an ISPF dialog that was developed using TSO/E 2.1
and ISPF 3.2 to process mail and files sent to and from TSO using the
IBM provided TSO TRANSMIT and RECEIVE commands.

A new addition is an ISPF Command Table for use with the dialog to suppo
the use of the LOG command to enter the mail log dialog.  This must be
created using the following steps:

    1.  Enter ISPF 3.9 (Commands)
    2.  Specify MAIL for the application id
    3.  Specify a verb of LOG
                  t of 0

Also included as part of this package is a TSO/E SAFE Mail application
that will receive mail messages and mail files for user's who are out
of the office and thus unable to RECEIVE their mail before the JES SPOOL
is purged of aged data.

Caveats:  Use this at your own risk and only after you have reviewed
every line of Rexx code to insure that you understand it and that there
is nothing that might be contrary to your installation standards or
practices.  I have tried to remove or document all of the installation
dependencies that I could find or think of, but I may have missed a
few - please let me know of any that need to be fixed or documented.

If you find a problem, please let me know.  I may or may not be able to
fix it depending upon your and my operating environment, but I will try.
Also, if you have any extensions, fixes, etc. for this dialog please let

This data set contains the following members:

$README  -  What you are currently reading...
CHANGES  -  Short list of changes to the dialog
DOCUMENT -  Brief Documentation on this dialog.
ASM      -  The source for the SHOW and SHOWTSO modules and HELP
            and samples for IMNXZ02 (for JES2 and JES3)
            Also the TMAILQRY source is included here.
EXEC     -  Set of REXX EXECs that are the driving force behind this
            dialog.
IBMMAIL  -  IMPORTANT information if using this with IBMMAIL addresses
MACROS   -  Assembler macros needed for the ASM members
MSGS     -  The ISPF Message for the dialog.
OTHER    -  Contains a dummy exec for RMBFMAIL (that I can't ship)
PANELS   -  The ISPF Panels used by the dialog.
PROCLIB  -  The started task JCL for SYS1.PROCLIB member SAFEMAIL.
SAFECDS  -  Sample primer for the SAFEMAIL.CDS data set
            (copy this member into the data set that you
             allocate for the Safe mail control data set).

The dialog now uses a new TSO command, TMAILQRY, that checks to
determine if there is mail to receive.  This command must be authorized
and thus must be included in your SYS1.PARMLIB list of authorized
TSO commands.  If you have ACF2 then it must also be included in your
command limiting table.

JES3 users should code IATUX42 to generate a message to TSO users when
mail is received from another node.

JES2 users should code Exit 13 to generate a message to TSO users when
mail is received from another node.

Special note about sending messages from TSO to PROFS.  The dialog now
supports the sending of messages from TSO to PROFS in the PROFS format.
This means that the PROFS user will see the messages in their mail menu
correctly with a valid subject.  There currently exists a problem when
acknowledgements are requested for these types of messages in that the
acknowledgement is returned to the MVS system in a form that cannot be
processed by the TSO RECEIVE command.  I have no circumvention for this
at this time and IBM does not recognize this as a problem.

SAFEMAIL is a very helpful and unique capability that is designed to be
a started task that wakes up every 24 hours or is started by some
automation or job scheduling system once a day and it will read a users
mail and save it for them while they are on vacation or out of the
office for whatever reason.  This is to prevent their mail from being
purged from the JES spool because of age.

SAFEMAIL requires TSO OPER authority as it performs a RECEIVE on behalf
of other users and the RECEIVE command enforces this.  SAFEMAIL should
also be given the ability to allocate data sets under any high level
index as the RECEIVE command will generate data sets for those users
who request it and you will not want to have SAFEMAIL abending because
of security.

Note:  There exist within this dialog a number of Rockwell dependencies
that you will have to address before you can completely install and
utilize this dialog.  These dependencies are:

Asm:     SHOW and SHOWTSO
         These are the sub-routine and the TSO command that we use to
         extract information from various system control blocks and
         from ACF2.  You should look VERY closely at the SHOW subroutine
         to remove anything that is local to Rockwell or does not apply
         to your environment.  The full SHOW package is now included
         as of 4/28/92 and includes a CLIST and REXX function as well
         as a SHOWSPF module - sample link jcl is also included.

Panels:  TMAILMNU
         This menu panel calls the TMAILDEF exec to establish a set of
         defaults for use by the other parts of the dialog.

Execs:   TMAILDEF
         This exec uses the Rockwell TSO Command SHOWTSO to extract
         basic information that is used by other elements of the ISPF
         dialog.  You can/should replace the use of SHOWTSO with your
         own default specification.  Or you can remove the use of
         SHOWTSO here as this exec displays an ISPF Panel for the
         defaults and requires that they be filled in.

         TMAILSAF
         This exec is used for the TSO Safe Mail process and uses the
         SHOWTSO command to extract the center name.  Based upon center
         it sets a high-level index that is used for the control data
         set name and the log data set (this log is only used when the
         RECEIVE command is issued for SAFEMAIL userid processing).

         TMAILSM
         This exec allocates a temporary file used for the message text
         that is sent to the SAFEMAIL application to register or
         un-register for safe mail processing.  The unit value is
         SYSVIO.  This exec also used the SHOWTSO command to extract
         the current home node (center).

         TMAILPTF
         This exec will unterse IBM PTF files received via Expedite/Mail
         (ordered via IBMLINK).  The load library that contains the
         unterse load module must be updated to reflect your library.

         TMAILSND
         This exec allocates a temporary file used for entering the text
         of messages to a unit of SYSVIO.  If you have SYSVIO defined
         for VIO then you do not have to change this exec, otherwise
         SYSVIO must be changed to either real disk or your VIO
         esoteric.

         You will also need to update the SMTP information variables
         if you wish to send mail via SMTP (e.g. Internet, Bitnet).

         This exec also contains a list of node names that are used to
         determine if the node is TSO or non-TSO.  You will need to
         update this list of node names.

         TMIBMFAX

         This exec is an ISPF Edit Macro that will build the appropriate
         header information for sending a note to the IBMMail FAX
         service for delivery via a fax machine.  It is invoked by
         entering FAXIBM on the ISPF Command Line while in the note
         creation Edit panel.

         TSOMAIL
         This exec uses the Rockwell TSO Command SHOWTSO to extract the
         current NJE Node Name.  You should replace this with your own
         command/clist/exec or hard code the node name in the exec.
         This exec also defaults the name of the users TSO mail log data
         set to userid.LOG.MISC.  If this is not your default (look at
         your INMXPARM assembly) then you must change this exec.  This
         exec also uses the PDS TSO command when the current mail table
         data set is full and must be reallocated and copied.  If you do
         not have the PDS command (it's free from various MVS tools
         tapes) then you should change the copy to use IEBCOPY or some
         other copy command.  Another dependency is the use of the
         Rockwell %RPRINT clist which invokes a Rockwell dialog of
         various print drivers for different vendors printers.  This
         dialog is not provided with this data set as you can probably
         do it better.

This data set contains an ISPF Dialog that simplifies the processing of
the ISPF command tables.

Members:

   CMDSA     ISPF Panel
   CMDSB     ISPF Panel
   CMDS00    ISPF Messages
   CMDS      ISPF REXX Procedure

The entry to this dialog is via the CMDS REXX Procedure.

To use this dialog you will also have to create an ISPF Command Table of
name CMDSCMDS.  Enter ISPF 3.9 and enter CMDS as the Application ID and
create a single row like the following:

            Verb      T  Action
                            Description
       '''' RFIND     0  PASSTHRU

This file should be processed by IEBUPDTE and will create the following
members:

   $README  -  What you are currently reading
   EXEC     -  IEBUPDTE input to your SYSEXEC (REXX procedure)
               library
   PANELS   -  IEBUPDTE input to your ISPF Panels library

Both EXEC and PANELS must have +/ change to ./ before being processed by
IEBUPDTE into their appropriate target libraries.

Below is the brief documentation on the CUT and PASTE ISPF Edit Macros:

 CUT is a REXX ISPF edit macro to copy or move lines from the current
 edit session and place them in a shared ISPF table. The PASTE macro
 will copy or move the data into another edit session.  See the
 tutorial starting with panel #CUT for further information.

 CUT <REPLACE > <TABLE table> <NX> <col-1 col-2> <COPY> <range>
     <EXTEND  >               <X >               <MOVE>
     <SHOW    >
     <DELETE  >
     <PROMPT  >
     <PROFILE >
     <HELP × ?>


 PASTE is a REXX ISPF edit macro to copy or move lines from a shared
 ISPF table into the current edit session. The table must have
 previously been created by the CUT macro.  See the tutorial starting
 with panel #CUT for further information.    Syntax:

 PASTE <COPY  > <TABLE table> <AT at> <col-1 col-2> <AFTER>   <range>
       <MOVE  >                                     <BEFORE>
       <HELP×?>                                     <OVERLAY>
       <PROMPT>

This file contains a simple ISPF Dialog that facilitates the transfer of
data between a workstation and an MVS/TSO session without requiring the
user to exit ISPF to a TSO READY state.

This dialog will also internally invoke the ADMUPCFT clist from GDDM to
support the uploading and downloading of PIF files.  This is detected by
having the character string ADMGDF or ADMCGM as a parameter during the
SEND or RECEIVE.

The dialog is called PCTFHOST, for PC To/From a HOST.  It consists of 3
elements:

1.  The REXX Procedure  (PCTFHOST)
2.  The ISPF Panel      (PCTFHOST)
3.  An entry in the ISPF Commands table (ISPCMDS entry)

This data set is in IEBUPDTE format and contains 3 members:

1.  $README   - What you are reading
2.  EXEC      - The REXX Procedure
3.  PANEL     - The ISPF Panel

Installation Instructions:

A.  Copy the REXX Procedure from member EXEC into a CLIST or REXX
    library concatenated to your ISPF session under either SYSPROC
    or SYSEXEC.  It should be named PCTFHOST.

B.  Copy the ISPF Panel from member PANEL into an ISPF Panels library
    concatenated to your ISPF session under ddname ISPPLIB.  It
    be named PCTFHOST.

C.  The ISPF Command Table entry is added to the ISP Commands Table by:

    1.  Copy ISPCMDS from the existing ISPF Table data set in which it
        resides to your own ISPF Table as PCTCMDS or copy it within the
        existing table data set.
    2.  Enter ISPF Option 3 (Perform Utility Functions) and select optio
        9 (Commands).
    3.  Enter PCT for the Application ID
    4.  Place an I where you see '''' to cause a blank row to be inserte
    5.  Insert the following information on the blank row:

        '''' PCTFHOST  4  SELECT CMD(%PCTFHOST)
                             display command entry panel for PC To/From

    6.  Rename ISPCMDS to OLDCMDS to save it in case you blew it
    7.  Rename PCTCMDS to ISPCMDS
    8.  Exit ISPF
    9.  Enter ISPF and type PCTF (which is a supported abbreviation for
        PCTFHOST ISPF Command)

D. Have fun.

Application:  FASTPATH

This is an ispf application that is used to assist the user in finding a
fast path commands within ISPF.  Fast path commands are those that are d
in the ISPF Command Table named ISPCMDS (at least for the purpose of thi
application).

Installation:

1. Copy the FASTPATH rexx procedure into a system level SYSEXEC or SYSPR
   library.
2. Copy the panels into a system level ISPF Panel library.
3. Update the ISPF Commands Table ISPCMDS:
   a.  Copy ISPCMDS into NEWCMDS
   b.  Using ISPF 3.9 update NEWCMDS to add the following information:

        Verb      T  Action
                        Description
   '''' FASTPATH  5  SELECT CMD(%FASTPATH)
                        Display selection list of all fast path commands

   c.  Rename ISPCMDS to OLDCMDS
   d.  Rename NEWCMDS to ISPCMDS
4. Exit ISPF and reenter to activate the new table
