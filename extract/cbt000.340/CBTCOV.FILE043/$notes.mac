 Notes on the ISPF Smoke and Mirrors Tape, Version 1


    This tape was born of good intentions, and has much good stuff
    on it.  However, it was the victim of decreasing SHARE commitments
    on the part of some employers.


  Jim Marshall took care of this tape.  His address is:


                    JIM MARSHALL, US TREASURY
                    FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT SERVICE
                    PRINCE GEORGES PLAZA II - ROOM 400B
                    3700 EAST-WEST HIGHWAY
                    HYATTSVILLE, MD  20782
                    202-874-8353

  I suppose that information on "anonymous contributors", etc. can
  still be obtained from him.  Good luck.  Use it all well.


  On the CBT Overflow Tape, add 40 to all file numbers.  Therefore,
  File 4 in the documentation is File 44 on this tape.
