SHARE CODE - UF


THIS VERSION OF QUEUE WAS DERIVED FROM FILE 278 OF THE CBT MODS TAPE,
WHICH HAD BEEN OBTAINED FROM VERSION 18 OF THE SHARE JES2 PROJECT TAPE.
IT HAS BEEN RUN ON THE FOLLOWING VERSIONS OF JES2 (ASSUMING THAT THE
APPROPRIATE SYSPARM OPTIONS HAVE BEEN SET):
       JES2 4.1
       JES2 NJE 3.1
       MVS/SP-JES2 RELEASE 3

IN THE NERDC ENVIRONMENT, USE OF THE QUEUE COMMAND IS RESTRICTED TO
SYSTEMS PROGRAMMING PERSONNEL INVOLVED IN JES2 MAINTENANCE, AND THERE
HAVE BEEN SEVERAL COMMANDS ADDED FOR THIS USAGE.  AN ATTEMPT HAS BEEN
MADE TO REQUIRE THAT THE COMMANDS THAT ALLOW THE UNRESTRICTED ACCESS
TO SPOOL DATA AND CONTROL BLOCKS BE AVAILABLE TO ONLY AUTHORIZED USERS,
BUT THERE WERE ALSO CHANGES MADE TO ALLOW THOSE AUTHORIZED USERS FULL
ACCESS TO THE SYSTEM WITHOUT HAVING ANY NAMING CONVENTION RESTRICTIONS
IMPOSED UPON THEM.  IT IS THEREFORE NORMAL FOR AN AUTHORIZED USER
TO BE ABLE TO USE THE LIST COMMAND AGAINST ANY JOB IN THE SYSTEM
INSTEAD OF HAVING TO USE THE XD COMMAND.

THE COMMAND ONLY NEEDS TO RUN AUTHORIZED FOR THE FOLLOWING COMMANDS
CANCEL, REQUEUE, AND PURGE. IF YOU DO NOT MARK THE CODE AC=1, THESE
THREE COMMANDS WILL NOT FUNCTION.

INSTALLATION PROCEDURE FOR QUEUE:

     1. Q0 IS THE COMMON AREA.
        QCOMMON, QSTART, QSTOP, QTILT, AND $JQT ARE MACROS.
        OTHER MEMBERS NOT STARTING WITH $ OR # ARE RENT SOURCE MODULES
        (SEE MEMBER $NERJCL FOR A COMPLETE LIST).
        (USERS OF THE OLD QUEUE COMMAND WILL NOTICE THAT ALL OF THE
         Q1 - QNN MODULES HAVE BEEN RENAMED TO MAKE LIFE EASIER ON ME.)
        #HELP IS THE TSO HELP MEMBER.
        $NERJCL IS THE JCL TO ASSEMBLE AND LINK QUEUE.
        TABLE IS A SAMPLE SMP JOB TO AUTHORIZE THE QUEUE COMMAND.

     2. EDIT MEMBER QCOMMON CHANGING THE FOLLOWING PARAMETERS:

        UNIT=XXXX THE DEVICE TYPE FOR SYS1.HASPCKPT.
        VOLSER=YYYYYY THE VOLUME SERIAL FOR SYS1.HASPCKPT.
        SID1-SID7=ZZZZ THE SMF IDS FOR EACH CPU IN THE COMPLEX. THE
        IDS MUST BE IN THE SAME ORDER AS IN THE INITIALIZATION DECK.

        AT PRESENT THERE IS SUPPORT IN THE INITIALIZATION MODULE TO
        DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATE THE CHECKPOINT ON EITHER 3330, 3330-1,
        3350, OR 3380. IF YOU ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE A DRUM OR
        SOMETHING ELSE YOU WILL HAVE TO MODIFY INIT TO ADD SUPPORT.

        EDIT THE MACRO QSTART TO INDICATE THE OPTIONS DESIRED,
        OR SPECIFY THEM AS SYSPARM INPUT TO THE ASSEMBLER.
        IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO LOOK AT THE MACRO FOR A DESCRIPTION
        OF THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE.

     3. EDIT MEMBER $NERJCL TO CHANGE THE JCL TO FIT YOUR STANDARDS.
        DO NOT ALTER THE ORDER OF THE ASSEMBLY SYSLIBS AS THERE IS A
        CONFLICT ON THE MACRO QSTART.  THE DBCSYMED PROGRAM THAT IS USED
        AFTER THE ASSEMBLIES IS A PART OF THE YALE DBC PROGRAM PRODUCT
        AVAILABLE FROM CSR.  IT EDITS THE GENERATED SYM CARDS IN THE
        OBJECT DECK TO REMOVE NULL ENTRIES AND MOST OF THE DUPLICATE
        ONES.  IF THE PROGRAM IS NOT AVAILABLE, SIMPLY DELETE THE STEP
        AND CHANGE THE ASSEMBLER SYSPUNCH REFERENCE.

        THE SUPPLIED JCL GENERATES A SINGLE LOAD MODULE WHICH IS NOT
        REENTRANT.  THIS IS IDEAL FOR TESTING, BUT MAY NOT BE DESIRED IN
        A PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT.  TO GENERATE A REENTRANT VERSION OF
        THE COMMAND, LINK ALL MODULES EXCEPT Q0 AS A SINGLE PROGRAM
        NAMED QUEUE (ALIAS Q) INTO SYS1.LPALIB.  IT WILL NEED AN
        AUTHORIZATION CODE OF 1 IF YOU DESIRE TO USE THE CANCEL,
        REQUEUE, AND PURGE COMMANDS.  THE LINKEDIT OF MODULE QUEUE WILL
        GENERATE AN UNRESOLVED EXTERNAL REFERENCE FOR MODULE QUEUECMN,
        WHICH IS NORMAL AND SHOULD BE IGNORED.  MODULE Q0 SHOULD THEN BE
        ASSEMBLED AND LINKED INTO SYS1.LINKLIB OR SYS1.CMDLIB WITH A
        NAME OF QUEUECMN.  IF YOU WANT TO CHANGE THE NAME OF QUEUECMN,
        THE ONLY REFERENCE TO IT IS IN MEMBER INIT WHERE THE LINK IS
        ISSUED.

     4. IF THE CANCEL, REQUEUE, AND PURGE COMMANDS ARE DESIRED, ADD
        QUEUE (ALIAS Q) TO THE IKJEFTE2 MODULE WHICH IS THE TSO LIST
        OF AUTHORIZED COMMANDS. A SAMPLE SMP JOB IS PROVIDED IN THE
        MEMBER TABLE. QUEUE CAN BE RUN UNDER SPF BUT THE SUBCOMMANDS
        USING THE SUBSYSTEM INTERFACE (CANCEL, REQUEUE, AND DELETE)
        WILL BE INOPERABLE, ALL OTHER COMMANDS WILL FUNCTION NORMALLY.
        IF YOU DON'T MIND THE INTEGRITY PROBLEM YOU CAN ADD CODE TO
        QUEUE TO USE A SPECIAL SVC TO GET INTO SUPERVISOR STATE AND
        HAVE FULL FACILITY UNDER SPF.

USERS THAT DO NOT HAVE THE UICC JTIP PACKAGE INSTALLED WILL NEED TO
EITHER CHANGE THE QSTART MACRO OR SPECIFY NOJTIP IN THE ASSEMBLER
SYSPARM OPTIONS.

USERS THAT DO NOT HAVE THE YALE DBC PACKAGE INSTALLED SHOULD
EITHER CHANGE THE QSTART MACRO OR SPECIFY NODBC IN THE ASSEMBLER
SYSPARM OPTIONS.  IF DBC IS SPECIFIED BUT THE PACKAGE DOES NOT
EXIST, ALL THAT WILL HAPPEN IS THAT A MESSAGE WILL FLASH ON THE
USER'S TERMINAL INDICATING THAT THE LOAD FOR MODULE DBC FAILED.
THIS MESSAGE CAN BE IGNORED.

SOME OF THE CODE MAY BE DEPENDENT ON ASSEMBLER H, BUT ALL THAT SHOULD
BE NEEDED IS TO MOVE SOME OF THE DSECTS AROUND TO GET THEM IN THE
PROPER ORDER FOR THE OTHER ASSEMBLERS.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON THE SUPPORT FOR MVS/SP-JES2 RELEASE 2 AND
ABOVE, SEE MEMBER $SP.

TO MAKE IT EASIER TO ENTER CERTAIN COMMANDS, COMMAND NAMES MAY NOW
BE UP TO FOUR CHARACTERS.

MEMBER $LOG IS A CHRONOLOGICAL LIST OF THE CHANGES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE
TO THIS PROGRAM, AND SHOULD BE CONSULTED BY USERS WHO HAVE A PREVIOUS
VERSION AND WANT TO KNOW WHAT HAS BEEN CHANGED.

FOLLOWING IS A LIST OF THE INDIVIDUAL MODIFICATIONS:

UF001  ALLOW QUEUE COMMAND TO ASSEMBLE USING NJE3.1 SOURCE CODE.
       A FEW EQUATES AND ADDITIONAL DSECTS WERE INCLUDED, WHICH SHOULD
       BE OK FOR NON-NJE SOURCE AS WELL.

UF002  ALLOW QCOMMON TO BE LINKED IN FOR TESTING.
       WE RUN WITH SEVERAL DIFFERENT SPOOL PACK FORMATS DURING TEST,
       AND IT IS CONVENIENT TO HAVE MULTIPLE VERSIONS OF QUEUE TO
       SUPPORT THESE DIFFERENT TEST VERSIONS.
       IT IS ALSO MUCH SIMPLER TO RUN UNDER TSO TEST.

UF003  SUPPORT FOR 3278 MODELS 2, 3, 4, AND 5.
       WE HAVE A WIDE ASSORTMENT OF TERMINALS IN-HOUSE, SO QUEUE WAS
       MODIFIED TO SUPPORT ALL TERMINAL TYPES AS BASIC MODEL 2, AND
       TO ALLOW THE USER TO SWITCH TO THE LARGER SCREEN FORMAT AT ANY
       TIME DURING HIS SESSION.
       THIS CODE IS CURRENTLY RUNNING UNDER ACF/VTAM REL 2, BUT WAS
       DEVELOPED UNDER ACF/VTAM REL 1, AND HAS ALSO RUN WITH TCAM AT
       THE 8011 LEVEL.

UF004  ADD A TITLE CARD FOR Q0 (QCOMMON).

UF005  DO NOT CHECK FOR JOBNAME MATCHING TSO LOGON ID IF QXAUTH=1.
       ALSO ALLOW READING DSID'S LESS THAN 101 IF QXAUTH=1.
       DSID'S LESS THAN 101 ARE SOMETIMES USEFUL TO LOOK AT;  THE
       INTERNAL TEXT FILE MAKES IT EASIER TO LOCATE THE PROPER DSID
       IN A SYSGEN WHERE ALL STEPNAMES ARE "ASM", AND IN A VM NETWORK
       ENVIRONMENT IT IS COMMON TO HAVE OUTPUT DSID'S OF 1.

UF006  ONLY READ THE CHECKPOINT IF THE INFORMATION IS NEEDED.
       THE READ OF THE CHECKPOINT IS REMOVED FROM THE MAIN EXECUTION
       LOOP, SINCE IT IS REALLY SILLY TO READ A LARGE CHECKPOINT DATASET
       WHEN THE USER COMMAND IS TO JUST REPOSTITION WITHIN THE CURRENT
       FILE.

UF007  CHANGE COMMANDS "DD *" AND "L * DSID" TO USE THE LAST JOBNAME
       IF A "*" IS SPECIFIED.  THIS MAKES IT EASIER TO TYPE, AND CODE
       IS ADDED TO SKIP THE CHECKPOINT READ FOR PERFORMANCE REASONS.
       IT IS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED THAT THE "*" BE USED INSTEAD OF THE
       JOB NAME/NUMBER SINCE THE RESPONCE TIME IS SO MUCH BETTER.

UF008  HAVE THE FINDPDDB ROUTINE START AT THE FIRST IOT IF PDDB IS NOT
       FOUND.  A MIXTURE OF SPIN AND REGULAR PDDB'S USED TO CAUSE
       THE ROUTINE TO SCAN TO THE END OF THE IOT'S AND STAY THERE WHILE
       TRYING TO LOCATE THE FIRST REGULAR PDDB AFTER A SPUN ONE.

UF009  ADD SYNAD ROUTINE AND ADDITIONAL CHECKING TO READSPC ROUTINE SO
       THAT THE SYSTEM WILL NOT FAIL DURING XB PROCESSING.

UF010  IF USER HAS TSO OPERATOR AUTHORITY, SET FLAG BIT IN QFLAG1,
       AND FORCE QXAUTH ON.

UF011  ADD MODULE HEXDUMP (Q28) WHICH WILL GENERATE AN ABEND FORMAT
       DUMP OF THE DATA PASSED TO IT.

UF012  CHANGE HEXBLK (Q9) TO USE HEXDUMP FOR FORMATTING THE READ
       BUFFER.

UF013  CHANGE HEXBLK (Q9) TO ALLOW ADDITIONAL INPUT PARAMETERS FOR
       DUMPING CURRENT BLOCK, AND OFFSETS INTO THE REQUESTED BLOCK.
       IF THE BLOCK ADDRESS PARAMETER IS "+", THE BUFFER CHAINED FROM
       THE CURRENT BUFFER WILL BE DUMPED.

UF014  CHANGE PARSE (Q16) TO USE 4 CHARACTER COMMAND NAMES, AND
       CHANGE LOGIC FOR DETERMINING IF A COMMAND IN PRIVILEGED.

UF015  ADD MODULE CJQE (Q29) TO DUMP JQE IN HEX.

UF016  ADD MODULE CJCT (Q30) TO DUMP JCT IN HEX WITH OPTIONAL
       OFFSET SPECIFIED.

UF017  ADD MODULE CTSO (Q31) TO ALLOW ANY TSO COMMAND TO BE ISSUED
       WHILE IN QUEUE.

UF018  CHANGE DEFAULT STARTUP COMMAND TO "HELP" SO GET STARTED FASTER.

UF019  ALLOW SYSPARM TO CHANGE &QXXX DEFAULTS.

UF020  SUPPORT FOR SP2 LEVEL OF JES2.
       NOTE: THERE ARE PROBABLY SOME BUGS IN THE DISPLAY COMMANDS AT
             THIS LEVEL.  THEY ARE BEING FIXED AS THEY ARE DISCOVERED,
             BUT SINCE THE NERDC DOES NOT NORMALLY USE THESE COMMANDS,
             IT MAY TAKE SOME TIME TO DISCOVER THE ERRORS.

UF021  SUPPORT FOR SP2 PTF UZ52546 (8110 LEVEL SET).

UF022  ADD MODULE CHCT (Q32) TO DUMP HCT CHECKPOINTED AREA.

UF023  ADD SYMDEL/SYMNODEL STATEMENTS AROUND DSECTS TO REDUCE
       NUMBER OF SYM ENTRIES IN FINAL LOAD MODULE.
       (THE DBCSYMED PROGRAM READS IN THE GENERATED OBJECT
       DECKS AND REMOVES SYM ENTRIES THAT APPEAR BETWEEN
       SYMDEL/SYMNODEL DSECT DEFINITIONS.  THIS CAN CUT THE
       SIZE OF THE FINAL LOAD MODULE BY MORE THAN HALF.)

UF024  ADD DIE COMMAND TO FORCE AN ABEND SO CAN GET BACK INTO THE
       DEBUGGING ENVIRONMENT, AND ESTABLISH ESTAE DURING INIT.

UF025  ADD PDDB COMMAND TO LIST PDDB'S FOR A JOB.  THIS IS USEFUL WHEN
       THE DD COMMAND FAILS FOR SUCH THINGS AS SYSOUT RECEIVED FROM
       OTHER NODES AS WELL AS DURING DEBUGGING OF MISC PROBLEMS.
       IF &QJTIP IS ON, THE PROC, STEP, AND DDNAMES WILL BE FORMATTED.

UF026  ADD JOE COMMAND TO DUMP JOES FOR A JOB.

UF027  FIX XI COMMAND TO PROPERLY LIST ALL INITIATOR CLASSES.

UF028  CHANGE SAVE COMMAND TO ALLOW QPARM3 TO SPECIFY THE VOLSER
       THAT THE DATASET IS TO BE ALLOCATED TO.
       (QPARM2 IS USED TO SPECIFY THE DATASET TYPE.  IT WASN'T
       DOCUMENTED, EITHER.)
       NOW THE COMMAND IS:
         SAVE DSN <DSTYPE> <VOLSER>

UF029  CHANGE Q7 FORMAT TO FIX ERROR IN TESTING FOR JOB ACTIVE ON A
       PRINTER.

UF030  ADD JOB HISTORY COMMAND (Q35).
       THE MODEL FOR THIS COMMAND WAS PROVIDED BY KEN TRUE OF INTEL.

UF031  CHANGE TRANSLATE IN THE DISPLAY (Q5) MODULE TO CHANGE X'FF'
       TO A BLANK.  THIS IS REQUIRED FOR REMOTE 3278'S.

UF032  ADD &QNERDC GLOBAL TO ALLOW FOR LOCAL DEPENDENCIES.
       SO FAR ONLY Q35 JOB HISTORY USES THIS FLAG.

UF033  CHANGE Q8 HELP TO PRINT BLANK LINES TO FORCE THE PLUS SIGN TO
       BE GENERATED AT THE BOTTOM OF EACH PAGE TO INDICATE TO THE USER
       THAT MORE DATA FOLLOWS.  THIS CODE FROM KEN TRUE AT INTEL.

UF034  CHANGE Q6 FINDJOB TO GENERATE ERROR MESSAGE IF A "*" WAS USED
       AS THE JOBID, BUT THE JQE FIELD HAS NOT YET BEEN INITIALIZED.
       THIS IS A PROBLEM FOR USERS WHO DO A STATUS COMMAND, SEE ONLY
       ONE JOB LISTED, AND THEN THINK THAT THEY CAN USE THE "*" TO
       DISPLAY THAT JOB.

UF035  CHANGE Q6 FINDJOB SO THAT IF THE COMMAND WAS SYSLOG THEN
       IF QPARM1 IS NULL OR "SYSLOG" THEN LOCATE THE SYSLOG
          FOR THE ACTIVE SYSTEM.
       IF QPARM1 IS NOT NUMERIC, AND NOT "SYSLOG" THEN IT IS ASSUMED
          TO BE THE SMFID OF THE SYSTEM WHOSE LOG IS DESIRED.
          FOR THIS TO WORK IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE SYSTEM ID'S
          TO BE PROPERLY DEFINED IN QSTART.

UF036  ADD Q36 (SPIN) COMMAND PROCESSOR.
       A NEW COMMAND 'SPIN' WILL CAUSE A COPY OF THE CURRENT DATASET
          TO BE SPUN TO SYSOUT.
       AT THIS TIME, THERE ARE NO OPTIONS FOR THE COMMAND, BUT IT
          WOULD BE NICE TO ADD OPTIONS FOR DEST, SYSOUT CLASS, FORMS,
          AND RANGE OF LINE NUMBERS.
       THIS REQUIRED CHANGES TO ALLOCATE AND QSTART, AS WELL.

UF037  CHANGE Q10 TO ADD SUPPORT FOR 3380.

UF038  ADD TGPS COMMAND TO LIST THE TOP 20 USERS OF SPOOL SPACE.
       THIS IS A VERY USEFUL COMMAND TO USE WHEN YOUR SPOOL VOLUMES
       ARE NEARLY FULL AND YOU WOULD REALLY LIKE TO KNOW WHO HAS ALL
       OF THE SPACE.  OUR EXPERIENCE HAS SHOWN THAT WHEN THE SPOOLS
       GET FULL, THE TOP 20 JOBS (OUT OF OVER 1000) WILL HAVE ABOUT
       30% OF THE TRACK GROUPS.  THIS COMMAND ACTUALLY COUNTS THE TRACK
       GROUPS ASSIGNED TO EACH JOB, BY READING ALL OF THE ALLOCATION
       IOT'S.  BY DOING IT THIS WAY YOU GET THE ACTUAL SPACE USED, AND
       DO NOT GET THROWN OFF BY JOBS THAT WRITE ONE LINE TO EACH OF
       THOUSANDS OF SPUN SYSOUTS.
       *** NOTE ***:  THIS COMMAND DOES AN INCREADIBLE AMOUNT OF I/O AND
       TAKES A LONG TIME TO COMPLETE.  IN OUR ENVIRONMENT, RUNNING ON A
       TEST CPU WHICH FREQUENTLY GETS LOCKED OUT FROM THE SHARED SPOOLS
       BY THE FASTER PRODUCTION MACHINES, IT CAN TAKE AS LONG AS FIVE
       MINUTES FOR THE RESPONCE TO COME BACK, BUT SOMETIMES IT IS THE
       ONLY WAY.
       *** NOTE ***:  THE PERCENT COLUMN INDICATES THE PERCENT OF TRACK
       GROUPS USED OUT OF THE DEFINED NUMBER OF TRACK GROUPS FOR THE
       SYSTEM.  IF YOU HAVE ALLOWED FOR EXTRA SPOOLS, THE NUMBERS WILL
       DISPLAYED WILL BE LOWER THAN ACTUAL.

UF039  CHANGE CHECKPOINT READ TO MULTIPLE DECB'S BASED ON NCP.
       THE IDEA FOR THIS CODE CAME FROM THE UCLA/UOC VERSION OF THE
       QUEUE COMMAND.

UF040  ALLOW +/-NNN TO BE SPECIFIED ON THE LIST * COMMAND.

UF041  CHANGE TSO COMMAND PROCESSOR TO PROPERLY CLEAR SCREEN FOR TCAM.

UF042  ALLOW QCOMMON PARAMETERS TO BE SPECIFIED IN QSTART.
       THIS WILL CAUSE ALL OF THE COMMONLY CHANGED OPTIONS TO BE
       SPECIFIED IN ONLY ONE PLACE.

UF043  MOVE PFK DEFINITIONS TO QCOMMON, AND SET VIA QSTART.
       BY MOVING THE DEFINITIONS TO QCOMMON, IT WILL BE POSSIBLE
       FOR THE MODEL COMMAND TO SET THE PROPER VALUES FOR PFK 7/8,
       THE SCROLL COMMANDS, FOR THE DISPLAY SIZE.

UF044  CHANGE READSPC TO DO FURTHER VALIDITY CHECKING ON THE VALUE
       OF MTTR THAT IS PASSED TO IT.  THIS SHOULD ELIMINATE OCCASIONAL
       S0C4 AND S0C1 ABENDS FROM OCCURRING.

UF046  SUPPORT FOR JES2 AT THE SP 1.3.3 LEVEL (HJE2329).
       THIS SUPPORT IS ENABLED BY SPECIFYING SYSPARM(SP133), OR
       CHANGING THE QSTART MACRO TO DEFAULT &QSP133 TO 1.

UF047  ADD WRITER NAME TO JOE DISPLAY IN FORMAT ROUTINE.

UF048  SUPPORT FOR SP 1.3.4.  (ADD $DRAINED EQUATE FOR HCT EXPANSION).

UF049  FIX TO CKPT TO RESOLVE OCCASIONAL ABEND S0C4.
       CODE IN INIT ASSUMES THAT THE HEADER RECORD IN THE CHECKPOINT
       DATASET THAT INCLUDES THE HCT SAVEAREA WILL BE AT LEAST 4096
       BYTES LONG, AND THE READ FOR THAT AREA IN "CKPT" HAS A LENGTH
       OF 4096 CODED IN THE DECB.  CODE IN "CKPT" BUMPS THE I/O AREA
       POINTER BY THE LENGTH READ FROM THE DECB, CAUSING PROBLEMS
       IF THE HEADER RECORD IS LESS THAT 4K BYTES LONG.
       CODE IS CHANGED IN "CKPT" TO BUMP THE POINTER BY 4K.
