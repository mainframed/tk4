 SECTION  I                                                  Introductio



      The MVS Performance Project has developed a measurement tool.  Thi
 package, referred  to both as  the Share  Standard Monitor and  as DCMS
 provides a low-cost entry into MVS measurement and forms a common groun
 for exchange of measurement and tuning data and software.

      Throughout  this  document  the  Share  Standard  Monitor  will  b
 referred to as "DCMS"  (which stands for: Dirt-Cheap-Measurement-System
 DCMS was developed by members of the MVS Performance Project.

      The DCMS  package is supported  for MVS  systems of release  3.6 o
 later, with S.U.'s  4,5, and 7 installed, and separately  for MVS/SE. I
 is  an  interactive system,  allowing the user  to examine  various dat
 from the  running system.  DCMS is  designed primarily for use  with th
 3270 family of display devices.

      Current support  allows for use  of the  displays under TSO  or vi
 stand-alone system task using BTAM.

      The displays currently available with the DCMS package are oriente
 towards the tuning and debugging of the MVS SCP and associated hardware
 JES2 support displays do not exist, and currently only one limited SETU
 display is available for JES3.

      The displays provide data that  the Performance Project consider t
 be physical  and logical  elements of the  system that  have performanc
 implications.

      The basic  support software  allows the  addition of  displays wit
 very little  effort.  Macros  supplied with  the package  facilitate th
 construction and manipulation of full-screen displays.


 *** WARNING ***

     THIS IS A - NEW - VERSION OF  DCMS WHICH APPLIES ONLY TO MVS system
 with 5740-XE1 (MVS/SE S.U. 50) and its prerequisites installed.  Consul
 Section  II,  "INSTALLATION"  for  a  description  of  the  changes  an
 limitations  imposed  on  this  release   because  of  I.B.M.  copyrigh
 policies.

 SECTION  II                                           Installation Guid



 RECOVERING THE DATASETS.

      The first  step in  the installation process  is the  allocation o
 partitioned datasets  to receive  the data  from the  distribution tape
 The file formats and contents of  the distribution tape are described i
 Appendix I.

      A partitioned dataset must be allocated to receive each file on th
 distribution  tape.   A sample  job  stream  to allocate,  catalog,  an
 restore these datasets is provided in  Appendix II.  If at all possible
 the user  should use  the same  DSNAMES as  the distributor.   This wil
 allow the  use of  the supplied  JCL and  procedures with  little or  n
 modification.

 CONFIGURING THE SYSTEM.

     When the complete set of partitioned datasets has been restored, th
     DCMS load library is ready for initial use.

     At this point the user must decide which DCMS operating mode(s) wil
     be  employed, and  whether the  DCMS  system will  be configured  a
     "ACTIVE" or "PASSIVE" :


     PASSIVE OPERATION.

         When invoked from  an unauthorized library, DCMS  is a "passive
         system. In  passive mode, several  DCMS displays will  refuse t
         function, or only display data.  In  a "PASSIVE" system, DCMS i
         executing as an ordinary problem program, and will not interfer
         with the running  system.  This method of  operation is STRONGL
         RECOMMENDED for first-time DCMS users.


     ACTIVE OPERATION.

         By placing the name and volser of the DCMS load library into th
         system  APF list,  (member IEAAPF00  in  SYS1.PARMLIB) the  use
         enables  several  DCMS  displays which,  when  invoked  from  a
         authorized jobstep, allow  the alteration as well  as display o
         certain system data. Access to an "ACTIVE" DCMS system should b
         carefully restricted.  The user  is cautioned  against employin
         displays  such   as  "MERLIN"  in   alter  mode   without  firs
         understanding both the  function and purpose of  the display an
         the data being modified.

 SECTION  II                                           Installation Guid



 MODES OF OPERATION.

     DCMS can be invoked  from a dedicated 3277, from a  started task, o
     as a  series of TSO command  processors.  Different sets  of action
     will be required to install DCMS in each of the operating modes:

     TSO ACCESS.

         The DCMS load library must appear as  the STEPLIB in a TSO logo
         procedure to allow access from TSO.  The load library can, as a
         alternative,  be  copied  into   an  existing  command  library
         Copying  the  load   library,  because  of  its   size,  is  no
         recommended.

         When used in  TSO mode, DCMS supports hardcopy  TSO terminals a
         well  as  3277  display  devices.    The  support  for  hardcop
         terminals  is limited  to  data  display and  simulated  Progra
         Function Key entry.

     DEDICATED DEVICE SUPPORT.

         The  DCMS system  supports 3270  display devices  via BTAM  whe
         invoked as a  console-started system task.  A  procedure must b
         placed  in  SYS1.PROCLIB to  allow  DCMS  to be  activated  wit
         dedicated  devices.  The  distributed system  is  configured  t
         support  a single  local  3277 line  in  this mode.   Additiona
         devices  may be  added by  reassembling the  line control  tabl
         (module LTT$)  and adding  DD statements  to the  DCMS cataloge
         procedure. A sample DCMS procedure is supplied in Appendix III.

 SAMPLE JCL.

      The source distribution library contains several sample JCL stream
 to aid the user during installation:

     COMPILATION JCL.

         The members $GEN1,$GEN2, and $GEN3 in the source library are th
         three jobs necessary to completely recompile, linkedit, and lis
         the  DCMS  system.  These  jobs  must  be run  SEQUENTIALLY,  i
         numeric order. ($GEN1  first, then $GEN2, and  $GEN3 last)  Eac
         job  contains  three  instream  procedures.   Changes  to  thes
         procedures should be propogated to all three jobs.

     CATALOGED PROCEDURE.

         The member $PROC  in the source library is a  sample DCMS "star
         command"  procedure for  invoking  DCMS as  a  system task.   T
         quickly  and   simply  provide   a  DCMS   version  which   run
         nonswappable, the name "DCMS" in the EXEC PGM=  statement shoul
         be changed to  "IEDQTCAM".  This name is supplied  in the syste
         default program properties  table for TCAM, but can  be used fo
         DCMS, because DCMS REQUIRES a steplib.  The dispatching priorit
         of  DCMS should  be adjusted  to  place it  above most  ordinar
         address spaces, and below other measurement tools.

     MACRO LIBRARIES.

         Because certain  system macros used  by DCMS are  copyrighted b
         IBM, (for the  MVS/SE versions) the DCMS/SE  user is responsibl
         for obtaining and modifying the  system macros formerly supplie
         as the  -MACLIB- dataset in  this distribution.  Almost  all th
         required  macros  are  supplied  as  file  18  of  the  optiona
         materials tape  for 5740-XE1.   The remaining  macros should  b
         found in  SYS1.MACLIB, SYS1.AMODGEN, or  SYS1.AGENLIB.  Appendi
         VI provides a list of the macros needed in the -MACLIB- dataset

        This  monitor displays  utilization  of  logical channels  on  a
        interval specified by the user.  The utilization can be displaye
        in one of  two formats: percentage or request  rate. Both figure
        are  calcu- lated  by  the System  Resource  Manager  (SRM) on
        one-second interval. For  detailed information on how  it arrive
        at these figures, the module  IRARMIOM in component SC1-CX shoul
        prove useful. Additional PFK definitions are as follows:

 IV.    CPU (CPU Utilization)

        The CPU command presents the following statistics:
        1. Percent of CPU utilization. This is percent of sample with
           the Wait bit off. (NOTE: This percent is based on entire
           sample interval. All other percents are based on count of
           non-wait state PSW's).
        2. Percent of Supervisor state. This is percent of active PSW
           with Problem bit off. Supervisor state is further subdivided
           into: a.) The percent when an SVC was in control in task mode
           b.) When in SRB mode, and c.,) Other (which includes
            MODESET time, initiator time, JES and TCAM task time in
           supervisor state, etc.).
        3. Percent of User State. This is percent of active PSWs with
           problem bit on and non-system key (>7).
        4. Sample size. NOTE, when STATDIE initializes, it zeros out
           the pageable buffers. For the first 20 minutes,
           some buffers are still unfilled.
           There is no valid PSW which contains all 0 bits,
           so the sample is defined as :
           the set of PSWs with at least one bit on.
        5. Time
        6. Average Ready TCBS.
        7. Breakdown of CPU utilization by Key, SVC No., performance
           group, and program name. Note that the four (4) columns of
           data are separate and total vertically. Do not read them
           across the rows, because there is no horizontal association.
           Only ten items appear in each column, though it is easy
           to modify the program to print more. The columns will not
           total to 100 percent (100%), of course, if there is any
           omitted non-zero value. Descriptions are as follows:
           a. KEY     Breaks down active time by protect key.
           b. SVC     Breaks down active time by the SVC number
                      of the ten (10) most active SVCS.
           c. PG      Breaks down active time by the performance
                      group of the ASID in control.
           d. PGM     Breaks down active time by the CDENAME
                      pointed to by the highest PRB on the RB
                      queue.

 VII.   DIDOCS (MCS Command Interface)

        DIDOCS requires special  TSO authorization and is  an MCS comman
        interface facility. It  permits one to enter OS  and JES command
        and receive  the command response.  This is quite  different fro
        the RESOLVE  COM facility in that  it is possible to  receive, a
        the issuing terminal, the response from most commands.  It shoul
        be noted that partial output  from multi-screen displays may som
        times be  lost as a result  of the technique utilized  to captur
        the response.   This facility has proven  to be quite  useful fo
        the following types of displays:

        1.  $DI
        2.  $DA
        3.  $DQ.Q=XEQ

 XXV.   MERLIN (SRM Behavior and RCT/DMDT Modify) cont'd

        When invoked  by an  authorized user,  MERLIN allows  certain SR
        parameters to be  altered dynamically.  This facility  is invoke
        by depressing PFK  3.  THE field "MODE = DISPLAY"  will change t
        "MODE = ALTER" and certain of  the display fields will disappear
        while others will become low  intensity. The low intensity field
        are the only modifiable fields.

        MERLIN allows the alteration of the following items:

        1.  Domain Table Display
            a.  Domain  (shown for reference not modifiable)
            b.  Min MPL

        Note that  values may be entered  with or without  leading zeros
        and that  range tests are  performed.   Any user  supplied value
        that exceed  the SRM  imposed limits  for the  data item  will b
        forced to the SRM maximum or  minimum value.   Each alteration i
        "echoed" beside the original (altered)  data, with leading zeros
        as it is stored in the appropriate SRM control area.


        The user  is cautioned to  verify information before altering th
        values in the SRM.

 SECTION  IV                                Display Interface Convention




 INTRODUCTION

      The  standards   and  conventions  described  below   describe  th
 "compatible" interface for  user written display modules.   This outlin
 is intended to encourage the creation  of display routines which will b
 easily migratable to other shops.

      THIS SET OF  CONVENTIONS APPLIES TO ALL RELEASES OF  DCMS VERSION
 BEGINNING WITH RELEASE 2.0 .

 TRANSFER OF CONTROL

      Control is  passed to  each display  module via  the ATTACH  syste
 service in normal fashion.
      Standard system linkage conventions must  be observed for entry to
 and exit from, a display module.


 ENTRY LINKAGE

      Entry  initialization  for a  display  module  is provided  by  th
 DCMSTART  macro,  which  performs required  initialization  as  well  a
 save/work area  acquisition, standard linkage,  and housekeeping  of th
 Input-Output Control Block (IOCB).


 EXIT LINKAGE

      Exit processing  for a  display module is  provided by  the DCMSTO
 macro, which will  optionally generate the save/work  area DSECT, scree
 area definition,  and include  the service  subroutines, in  addition t
 generating the required module exit code.


 SCREEN SERVICE

      The screen  format services  provided are  supported from  a singl
 interface  (The TERMIO#  module).   All  communication with  the  scree
 service module  is via  an IOCB  which contains  control information  t
 support all display output.
      Note that all field references to the IOCB in a display module mus
 be SYMBOLIC, rather then explicit offset.

 SECTION  IV                                Display Interface Convention




 COMPATIBILITY RESTRICTIONS


      Please follow  all of  the restrictions  and programming  practice
 when writing a  display module.  These conventions will  allow others t
 use your display  modules with a minimum of discomfort,  and allow rapi
 distribution of new displays.

         Always  use  the  DCMSTART and  DCMSTOP  macros  for  entry/exi
         linkage.

         Always use symbolic names to refer  to DCMS control block field
         and flag bits.

         Use the DCMS macros for  screen formatting, generation of forma
         lists and display  and session control.  Do  not invoke service
         explicitly. Use the macro provided.

         Minimize  or  eliminate  installation   dependencies.   If  som
         dependencies  MUST   be  included,   comment  /   document  the
         carefully.

         Wherever possible, use the system  mapping macro instructions t
         generate control block DSECTs. Avoid  using explicit offsets an
         nonstandard names and DSECTs, to minimize release dependencies.

 SECTION  VI                                      Writing Display Module




 THE DISPLAY MODULE.


 User written display  modules are supported for both  PL/1 and Assemble
 language.   In  both   languages,  powerful  DCMS  macros   support  th
 interfaces to DCMS, allowing the user  to concentrate on developing dat
 collection, reduction  and formatting  code.   The  DCMS macro  languag
 provides  a complete  set of  default values  to aid  the novice.    Th
 experienced DCMS  user will,  with the  same macros,  be able  to creat
 highly specialized display modules.

 The DCMS macros  are individually explained later in  this section.  Tw
 sample display modules, in PL/1 and  assembler, have been provided.  Th
 PL/1 sample is in  Appendix IV, and the assembler sample  is in Appendi
 V.


 DATA DISPLAY.


 Data is displayed on  the terminal by a DCMS service  routine.  The use
 employs  the TRMIO  (terminal  I/O) macro  to  invoke  the terminal  I/
 service routine.   To display  data, a  data area,  called an  IMAGE, a
 instruction list, called a FORMAT and  an Input-Output Control Block (a
 IOCB) must be created by the user.

 The IMAGE contains the  actual data to be displayed on  the screen.  Th
 FORMAT contains control information defining  the position on the scree
 of  the   data  segments  in   the  image,  their   intensity,and  othe
 display-related characteristics.

 The address of the FORMAT list and the IMAGE data area must be stored i
 the IOCB prior  to calling the terminal service routine.   The IOCB als
 contains flag fields  to allow the user to control  the various optiona
 services provided.

 After initialization the program must set the data areas in the image t
 the  values  desired  and  issue the TRMIO macro to cause the data to b
 formatted  and placed on the screen. The I/O routines will then wait fo
 a  response  from   the  user,  take  whatever fields has  been typed i
 and reflect  those changes  in  the program's IMAGE.

 SECTION  VI                                      Writing Display Module




 SCREEN FORMATTING.


 A  program  may   contain up to twenty different  screen formats.  Ther
 may  be  an  aggregate total of two hundred fields.  Each screen  forma
 is  defined by  issuing the SFMT macro,  a series of FIELD  macros,  an
 an  SFEND  macro. The format describes the screen, but does not actuall
 reserve space for the data fields being  displayed.  This is done by th
 dsgen macro. For every FIELD macro in  the format that is specified wit
 a name,  the DSGEN  macro reserves a  data area  that can  be reference
 using that  name. Space may  be reserved in  the data areas  which  doe
 not map onto the screen by use of the IFILL macro.


 DISPLAY MODULE STRUCTURE.


 An assembler language  module should always begin with  a DCMSTART macr
 invocation.  If  the module is to  be reentrant, control and  data fiel
 housekeeping sholud  follow.  Main line  data collection code  should b
 next, followed by screen formatting  and display (terminal service call
 code.

 Constants and  non-reentrant data areas  should immediately  precede th
 DCMSTOP macro.   DCMSTOP will  generate a block  of constants,  then th
 module termination code, followed by the beginning of the save/work are
 DSECT.  Reentrant  data fields  defined by  the user  should immediatel
 follow the DCMSTOP macro invocation.

 INTEN       Display intensity. Defaults to HI for DISPLAY fields, LO
             for input fields. OFF creates a non-display field (usefull
             for passwords etc.).
 CURSOR      Controls placement of the cursor on the screen. Must be NO
             in all but one field. YES places the cursor at the
             beginning of the field. AFTER places the cursor the last
             non-blank character.
 MDT         Sets the initial state of the modified data tags. This
             parameter will probably never be used.
 ROW         Sets the row (1-23) in which the first data byte will be
             placed. If column is not specified, column 1 is assumed.
 COLUMN      Sets the column (1-80) in which the first data byte will
             placed. If ROW was not specified, the current row is
             assumed unless the column specified is already passed.
             In the latter case the next row will be used.


             Note  that row  1 column 1 cannot contain data  and that ro
             24 is reserved  for  the  monitor.   If no row or column ar
             specified the next available byte will be used.

 SECTION  VI                                      Writing Display Module


 THE TRMIO MACRO.

 FORMAT Gives the address of a SFMT macro or a dynamically constructed
        format which maps the image area onto the screen.

 IMAGE  Gives the address of the data area which contains the data to
        be written and is to receive the data read.

 The following four parameters are used to override the specifications i
 the  format.  If not specified, the specifications in the format will b
 used.


 RESTORE   See the discussion

 RESET                 under the SFMT

 BEEP                          macro instruction.

 CURSOR Overrides any cursor specification done in the format and

        places the cursor in the screen position corresponding
        to the given offset in the image. (reg) must contain
        the value, or the "address" must be a halfword containing
        the value.

 WAIT   Specifies that the operation is to be initiated and then
        control is to be returned to the program. The IOCB will
        contain the adress of the DECB used for the operation.
        The program must later use a TRMIO macro with the type
        specified as WAIT to cause the operation to be checked.
        The first word of the DECB is an ECB which will be posted
        when the TRMIO iocb,WAIT will complete immediately.

        Upon  completion  of   a READ field IOCBAID will  contain the AI
        returned from   the  terminal.   CLI  IOCBAID,AIDENT   will  tes
        that the read  was initiated  by  the user  hitting ENTER. ADICL
        is the  AID for  "CLEAR" and  AIDCAN  is   the  AID  for the  PA
        (CANCEL) key. AIDPA1 indicates that the  PA1  key  was  used, an
        this is  our current convention for  "back up one  level". IOBCU
        will contain a half-word giving the offset into the image of  th
        position  in  which   the user left the cursor.  If anything goe
        wrong  the   control  task  will issue  a message  containing th
        characters "0C3".

 APPENDIX VI                                       DCMS -MACLIB- CONTENT




      The list below indicates IBM system  macros which must be placed i
 the C.MVSTUNE.DCMS.MACLIB dataset before reassembling DCMS/SE.
  Note that  "IRA" prefix  macros invoked  internally by the  RMCNS macr
 (supplied) must  be altered.   all "A"  type adcons  must be  changed t
 remove unresolved-external-reference messages.  The  TSO EDIT syntax fo
 this change is:

          C * 10000000 /     A(/ A(0) A(/ ALL

      This change,  made to all  SRM dsect  macros, will allow  the RMCN
 macro  to  function  correctly,  by  changing  all  explicit  adcons  t
 comments.
