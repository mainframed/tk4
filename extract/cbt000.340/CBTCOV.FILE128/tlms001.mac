   --------------- TLMS/RACF INTERFACE --------------------------
    --> THIS CODE HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED UNDER RACF V1R2 AND V1R3
    WITH NO MAJOR CHANGES FOR 3-4 YEARS. NO RACF RELEASE DEPENDANCIES
    BEYOND RELEASE 1 VERSION 2 (TAPEVOL SUPPORT) ARE KNOWN.

    --> THE FOLLOWING JOB WILL CREATE AN IEBUPDTE FORMAT FILE ON
    TAPE, THEN PRINT IT. THE FILE ADDS THREE MEMBERS TO A DATASET
    (ICHRTX01, ICHRTX02, TLMSBYDSP) AND ATTEMPTS TO DO A ./ CHANGE
    ON MEMBERS=(TLMSDSPF,TLMBMASS,TLMSCTL,TLMBUPDA). THESE UPDATES
    ARE INTENDED TO FIT ON TLMS VERSION 2 REL. 3 (V2R3) AS SHIPPED
    FROM TLMS(BEFORE CAPEX??). ANY RESEQUENCING OF THE MODULES IN
    QUESTION WILL MEAN A RE-EXAMINATION OF THESE HOOKS.

    --> SUPPORT IS ADDED FOR PROTECT=YES AND ADSP USERS TO HAVE
    TLMS ADD DSN INFO TO THE TAPE PROFILE, REMEMBER THAT THE TAPE
    IS RACF PROTECTED, AND AUTOMATICALLY REMOVE RACF PROTECTION
    WHEN THE TAPE IS RETURNED TO THE SCRATCH POOL. "GRPACC" AND RACF
    NAMING CONVENTIONS ARE ALSO FULLY SUPPORTED.  ***NOTE*** THIS
    CODE WILL MEAN THAT TLMS AND RACF ARE ALWAYS IN SYNC... THIS CAN
    CAUSE CONSIDERABLE CONFUSION FOR USERS OF TOSS(TAPE OFF-SITE
    STORAGE) WHO USE GENERATION DATA GROUPS. THE SYSTEM CATALOG IS
    NOT NECESSARILY IN SYNC WITH RACF AND TLMS IF THE JOB CYCLES AND
    NUMBER OF GENERATIONS DO NOT MATCH THE TOSS SPECIFICATIONS. THIS
    CAUSES CONFUSION IN ATTEMPTING TO VERIFY CORRECT OPERATION, (IN
    AN ATTEMPT TO RESOLVE TLMS,CATALOG, AND RACF LISTINGS), BUT TO
    THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE NO PROBLEMS EXIST.

    --> TAPE LIBRARIANS GENERALLY WILL NEED NO KNOWLEDGE OF ANY RACF
    ADDITIONS TO TLMS PROCESSING EXCEPT IN THE CASE WHERE A TAPE WHICH
    HAS BEEN SCRATCHED IS TO BE MARKED NON-SCRATCH. TO PROPERLY ADD
    RACF PROTECTION AT THIS POINT IS VERY DIFFICULT, AND IS BEST LEFT
    TO THE RACF ADMINISTRATOR IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE END-USER. NOTE
    THAT TO USE A TSO UPDATE TO THE MASTER FILE AND MARK A TAPE AS
    SCRATCH WITHOUT REMOVING THE RACF PROTECTION WILL CAUSE THE TAPE
    TO REMAIN RACF PROTECTED. THIS CAN CAUSE SEVERAL PROBLEMS. NOTE
    THAT THE PROGRAMS WHICH USE SCRATCH FUNCTIONS WILL REQUIRE APF
    AUTHORIZATION, AND HENCE WILL LIKELY BE RESTRICTED TO BATCH USAGE
    UNLESS SPECIAL ACTION IS TAKEN.

    ---> ONE MODIFICATION IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. IN THE ICHRTX01 CODE,
    IF NAMING CONVENTIONS ARE NOT FOLLOWED, A U485 ABEND RESULTS. NO
    PARTICULARLY VALUABLE REGISTER INFORMATION IS PRESENT, AND NO WTO
    IS ISSUED. IF IMS IS USED THE U485 CAN BE CONFUSED WITH AN IMS
    ABEND, WITH WILD GOOSE CHASES RESULTING. I WOULD SUGGEST A SIMPLE
    WTO BE ADDED BEFORE ABENDING ANY USER, AND PERHAPS CHANGE THE
    U485 ABEND TO A MORE APPROPRIATE ABEND.

    ---> NOTE THAT NO NAMING CONVENTION EXITS ARE IN USE WITH THIS
    CODE, (NONE WERE REQUIRED), AND HENCE I CANNOT COMMENT ON WHAT
    CHANGES MAY BE REQUIRED IF NAMING CONVENTIONS ARE A PROBLEM. I CAN
    NOTE THAT NAMING CONVENTIONS ARE CHECKED INSIDE ICHRTX01 IN THE
    SAME MANNER THAT THEY ARE CHECKED IN THE RACF CODE, BUT THAT NO
    EFFORT WAS INVESTED IN PROVIDING A NAMING CONVENTION "HOOK". FOR
    USERS OF OTHER RACF EXITS, A WORD OF CAUTION: FOR SOME REASON
    (UNKNOWN BUT DEFINATELY ILL-CONCEIVED) I MANAGED TO MOVE THE
    ADDRESS OF THE IOSWA (IOS WORK AREA) FROM REGISTER 4 (WHEN TLMS
    IS INVOKED) TO REGISTER 3. THIS REGISTER IS THE KEY TO FINDING
    DATASET NAMES AND OTHER GOOD INFO IN ALL RACF EXITS I HAVE SEEN.
    IF YOU INTEND TO USE THIS CODE IN CONJUNCTION WITH A MODELLING
    EXIT WHICH WILL ACT ON TAPE PROFILES, THE EXIT WILL LIKELY EXPECT
    R4 TO POINT TO THE IOSWA AT THE TIME THAT "RACDEF" IS ISSUED.
    SINCE THE "RACDEF" IS ALWAYS ISSUED FROM HERE FOR TAPES (THE
    PROTECT=YES FLAG IS OFF BY THE TIME OF THE SYSTEM "RACDEF") I WOULD
    SUGGEST THAT THIS REGISTER ASSIGNMENT BE CHANGED...MY APOLOGIES.

    --> ALSO.. THIS CODE IS NOT COPYRIGHTED IN ANY MANNER, AND "NO
    WARRANTEE EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED..." ETC-JUST LIKE IBM
