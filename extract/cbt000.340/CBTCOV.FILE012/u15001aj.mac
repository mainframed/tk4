*        THE SUPERZAP AND ON REGAINING CONTROL WRITES THE SUPERZAP  *
*        CONTROL CARDS TO A DATA SET.(FOR EXAMPLE SYS1.ZAPLOG.)     *
*        THE ENTRY ALSO INCLUDES THE DATE & TIME OF APPLICATION,    *
*        DATA SET NAME,VOLUME TYPE AND SERIAL NUMBER. IF THE        *
*        SUPERZAP WAS UNSUCESSFUL A SPECIAL MESSAGE IS ALSO ADDED.  *
