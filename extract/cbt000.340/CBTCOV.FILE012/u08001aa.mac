GENERALISED RECORD SELECTION PROGRAM             27.4.1971
1.    A GENERALISED RECORD SELECTION PROGRAM 'SYSELECT',IS NOW AVAILABLE
      ON SYS1.LINKLIB. THIS PROGRAM SPLITS ONE FILE INTO TWO BY COMPARIN
      AN IDENTIFIER FIELD AGAINST VALUES SPECIFIED ON CONTROL CARDS. THE
      PROGRAM WILL BE USED CHIEFLY FOR :-
           (A) DROPPING "BAD"RECORDS ON A TRANSACTION OR
               MASTER FILE
           (B) SELECTING RECORDS OFF A FILE IN ORDER TO
               DISK PRINT THEM.
2.    THE CONTROL CARDS FOR THS PROGRAM ARE :-
           //S1 EXEC  PGM = SYSELECT
           //CONTROL  DD*
           NUM = NNN  POSN = NNN LEN = NNN     )DESCRIPTOR CARD
           XXXXXXXXX                           )VALUE CARDS
                                               )
           XXXXXXXXX                           )
           XXXXXXXXX                            )
           /*
           //IN DD                                 (1)
           //OUT DD                                (2)
           //PRINT DD                              (3)
      THE DESCRIPTOR CARD DESCRIBLES THE FIELD USED TO IDENTIFY RECORDS
      FOR SELECTION OFF THE FILE. PARAMETERS ON THIS CARD MUST BE IN
      THE CORRECT POSITION, AND NUMBERS MUST BE OF 3 DIGITS (LEADING ZER
      ARE SHOWN).
          NUM = NNN STARTS IN COLUMN 1, AND STATES THE NUMBER OF VALUE
                CARDS THAT WILL FOLLOW.
          POSN = NNN STARTS IN COLUMN 11, AND STATES THE POSITION IN THE
                 RECORDS OF THE IDENTIFIER FIELD. FOR THE PURPOSES OF
                 THIS PARAMETER, THE FIRST LYTE IN A RECORD IS CONSIDERE
                 TO BE LYTE '1'. ON VARIABLE LENGTH RECORDS, THE RECORD
                 COUNT IS INCLUDED AS PART OF THE RECORD.
          LEN = NNN STARTS IN COLUMN 21, AND STATES THE LENGTH IN
                BYTES OF THE IDENTIFIER FIELD. THUS MUST NOT EXCEED
                80 BYTES.
      CALUE CARDS CONTAIN VALUES OF THE IDENTIFIER FIELD FOR WHICH THE
      PROGRAM WILL TEST, STARTING IN CARD COLUMN 1. IF ANY OF THESE
      VALUES APPEAR IN THE RECORD'S IDENTIFIER FIELD,THE RECORD IS
      SELECTED AND PLACED ON THE "PRINT" FILE.  OTHERWISE,THE RECORD
      IS PLACED ON THE "OUT" FILE.
      (1) IS THE INPUT FILE.  THE TWO OUTPUT FILES((2) AND (3)) MUST
      HAVE DCB INFORMATION SPECIFIED ON THEIR DD CARDS.
3.    SYSELECT SHOULD BE USED ONLY TO COMPARE EQUAL BETWEEN THE
      IDENTIFIER FIELD AND A SMALL NUMBER OF VALUES ON VALUE CARDS. THE
      PROGRAM WILL ACCEPT UP TO 50 VALUE CARDS,BUT SPEED OF EXECUTION
      IS INCREASED IN PROPORTION TO THE NUMBER OF VALUE CARDS INCLUDED.
4.    SYSELECT CAN ONLY TEST EBCDIC DATA: TO TEST PAKED DECIMAL FIELDS
      VALUE FIELDS MUST BE PUNCHED IN HEXADECIMAL CHARACTERS.
NB    FOR. VBS FILES HAVE DCB=BFTEK=A ON INPUT & TREAT AS VB
