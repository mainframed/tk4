.*
.*       A CBAL MACRO WILL USUALLY BE CODED IN THE SOURCE OF THE
.*        PROGRAM WHICH ISSUES IT, BECAUSE IT IS USED TO EFFECT
.*        SUB-ROUTINE LINKAGE BETWEEN SEPARATE CSECTS, AND CONSEQUENTLY
.*        IS PROGRAM ( OR CSECT ) DEPENDENT.  THIS MACRO IS TO CATER
.*        FOR THE CASE WHERE A MAGOR MACRO ISSUES A CBAL, AND THAT
.*        MACRO IS INVOKED BY A SINGLE CSECT PROGRAM.
