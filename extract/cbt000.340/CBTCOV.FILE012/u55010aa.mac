    THIS IS A MODIFIED VERSION OF THE BRITISH RAIL SUPERMON
  (O06010). THE MAIN MODIFICATION IS THE ADDITION OF THE
  AUTODUMP ROUTINE WHICH EMPTIES THE O/P DATASET TO TAPE
  EVERY 20 MINUTES. THIS HAS NOT BEEN TESTED OUT THOROUGHLY
  AS WE USUALLY HAVE A TAPE DRIVE AVAILABLE FOR THE OUTPUT
  BUT NO DISK SPACE.
    THE FEATURE USES U55010CS WHICH ISSUES AN OPERATOR COMMAND
  AND IS A STAND-ALONE PROGRAM IN ITS OWN RIGHT (COMMAND(S) GO
  IN THE PARM FIELD SEPARATED BY /). THIS REQUIRES A RDRD
  PROCEDURE TO TAKE JCL FROM A PDS WHICH NEEDS TWO MEMBERS-
  ONE FOR NORMAL EMPTYING (DUMPMON) AND ONE FOR THE END OF
  RUN (DUMPEND).
    THE MONITOR APPEARS TO WORK SATISFACTORILY UNDER VS1 R3.1
  BUT HAS NOT BEEN TRIED UNDER ANY OTHER OS.

    MEMBER O06010 SHOULD BE CONSULTED FOR OTHER INSTRUCTIONS.
