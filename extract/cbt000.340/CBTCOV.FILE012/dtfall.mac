*        THE FOLLOWING POINTS SHOULD BE NOTED FOR ALL DTF'S -
*
*             A.  DO NOT TRANSCRIBE PARAMETERS LIKE WORKA=
*                 IOAREA= ETC. INTO THE DCB - DATA MANAGEMENT WILL
*                 ALLOCATE BUFFER SPACE DYNAMICALLY AT EXECUTION IF
*                 E.G. BUFNO=, BUFLN= ARE NOT CODED.
*             B.  AVOID DEVICE DEPENDENT PARAMETERS E.G. PRINTOV=,
*                 CONTROL= IN DTF'S AND DEVD=, OPTCD= IN DCB'S
*                 WHEREVER POSSIBLE.
*             C.  FOR GREATER FLEXIBILITY, CODE PARAMETERS LIKE
*                 BLKSIZE= IN THE JCL SO THAT MODIFICATIONS CAN BE
*                 MADE EXTERNALLY.  THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF KEYWORDS
*                 FOR A DCB IS MACRF=, DDNAME=, DSORG=.
*             D.  BEWARE DEFAULTS FOR OMITTED PARAMETERS - E.G.
*                 RECFORM= DEFAULTS TO FIXUNB IN A DTF, WHEREAS
*                 RECFM= DEFAULTS TO UNDEFINED IN A DCB.
