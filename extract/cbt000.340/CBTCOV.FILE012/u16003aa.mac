    THIS PROGRAM IS A FUNCTIONAL REPLACEMENT FOR IBM'S IEBGENER WHICH
 ONLY COPIES FILES AND DOES NOT DO ANY EDITTING.

    IT IS MUCH FASTER THAN IBM'S VERSION BECAUSE IT DESIGNED SOLELY
 FOR COPYING FILES NOT FOR EDITTING THEM.

    WHEN THE PROGRAM IS INSTALLED THE IBM VERSION MUST BE RENAMED TO
 "IBMGENER" AS IT IS CALLED BY THIS PROGRAM IF EDITTING IS REQUIRED.

    THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT REQUIRE A SYSPRINT OR A SYSIN DD CARD.
 IF A SYSIN DD CARD IS PROVIDED AND IS NOT "DUMMY" OR "NULLFILE" THEN
 THE PROGRAM XCTLS TO IBMGENER TO DO THE REAL THING.

    USER LABELS ARE HANDLED AS ARE DDNAME CHANGES IF IT IS CALLED FROM
 ANOTHER PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM COPIES THE DCB INFORMATION FROM THE SYSUT1
 DATASET TO THE SYSUT2 DATASET AND DEFAULTS TO (RECFM=U,LRECL=32760,
 BLKSIZE=32760) IF NO DCB IS SPECIFIED FOR THE INPUT FILE (LABEL=NL).

    THE PROGRAM COUNTS THE RECORDS AND ISSUES A WRITE-TO-PROGRAMMER
 REPORTING ON THE NUMBER COPIED.
