                          MAKEFORM     VERSION 3.  JUNE 7,1970
                          ********     **********  ***********
GENERAL DESCRIPTION.
     MAKEFORM IS A PROGRAM WHICH WILL PRODUCE COMPUTER-PRINTED OUTPUT IN
ANY DESIGN CHOSEN BY THE USER. ITS PRIMARY FUNCTION IS THE PRODUCTION OF
STANDARD FORMS, SUCH AS SCHEDULES, RUN-SHEETS, WORK-SHEETS, REPORT FORMS
ETC.  HOWEVER, THE ULTIMATE CAPACITY OF THE PROGRAM IS LIMITED ONLY BY T
DESIGN FACTORS WITHIN WHICH THE PROGRAM WAS WRITTEN.
     AS THE PRIMARY USE OF THE PROGRAM IS TO PRODUCE FORMS, THIS DOCUMEN
WILL DEAL MAINLY WITH ACHIEVING THIS END, BUT THE USER WILL NO DOUBT
CONSIDER MANY OTHER USES TO WHICH THIS PROGRAM COULD BE PUT.
     MAIN FEATURES OF THE PROGRAM ARE:-
 * ANY NUMBER OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF FORM MAY BE PRODUCED IN ONE RUN.

 * WITHIN EACH TYPE OF FORM, ANY NUMBER OF COPIES OF THE FORM MAY BE
      PRODUCED IN ONE RUN

 * LOW CORE USAGE

 * SUITABLE FOR HIGH-PRIORITY PARTITIONS

 * A FEATURE WHICH ALLOWS ONE BASIC LAYOUT TO BE MODIFIED FOR DIFFERENT
      TYPES OF FORM, WITHOUT HAVING TO RESPECIFY THE BASIC DESIGN.

 * COMMUNICATION WITH THE OPERATOR FOR THE PURPOSES OF CHANGING STATIONE
      CARRIAGE-CONTROL TAPES, AND UCS PRINTER TRAINS.

 * AUTOMATIC SETUP

 * EASY METHODS OF SPECIFYING REPETITION OF SINGLE LINES, OR OF GROUPS O
      LINES.

 * EASY INSERTION OF DATA INTO A PREVIOUSLY SPECIFIED LINE

 * INPUT FROM ANY SEQUENTIAL DEVICE, OR FROM THE CONSOLE TYPEWRITER, OR
      FROM BOTH DEVICES DURING A RUN.

 * COMPREHENSIVE ERROR-CHECKING FACILITIES, WITH RETRY CAPABILITY WHEN T
      INPUT IS FROM A CONSOLE TYPEWRITER, AND IDENTIFICATION OF THE FIEL
      IN ERROR WHEN THE INPUT IS FROM ANY OTHER DEVICE

     THE PROGRAM IS CONTROLLED BY INPUT IN CARD-IMAGE FORM, CONSISTING O
CONTROL STATEMENTS AND DATA STATEMENTS. INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARING THESE
STATEMENTS ARE GIVEN LATER.

RUNNING MAKEFORM.

     THE JCL REQUIRED TO RUN THE JOB IS:-
     //JOBNAME JOB     ETC
     //STEPNAME EXEC PGM=MAKEFORM
     //STEPLIB DD DSN=STEPLIB,DISP=SHR
     //FORMS DD UNIT=1403 (OR COULD BE SYSOUT OR TAPE)
     ***    DO NOT USE DSO
     //CARDS DD *  (OR CONCATENATED MEMBERS OR SEQUENTIAL DATASETS)
        CONTROL AND DATA CARDS

OPERATIONAL DETAILS.

     MAKEFORM WILL RUN IN A 16K PARTITION IF THE RESIDENT ACCESS METHODS
OPTION IS CHOSEN AT IPL. IF THE HOLD FUNCTION IS USED (SEE LATER) THE
PROGRAM WILL EXPECT TO FIND AN EXTRA 8K, AND IF THIS IS NOT AVAILABLE WI
TERMINATE WITH A MESSAGE TO THE OPERATOR.
(SEE ALSO THE LATER SECTION ON MESSAGES PRODUCED BY MAKEFORM AND ACTION
 THAT SHOULD BE TAKEN)

CONTROL AND DATA STATEMENTS.

     ALL CONTROL STATEMENTS HAVE THE CHARACTER > (HEX 6E,PUNCH 0-6-8)
PUNCHED IN THE FIRST COLUMN OF THE CARD. (THROUGHOUT THESE NOTES REFEREN
WILL BE MADE TO CARDS, FOR EASE OF READING, BUT OF COURSE THE CARD-IMAGE
MAY BE PRESENTED TO THE SYSTEM IN ANY MEDIUM)
     THERE IS ONE EXCEPTION TO THE RULE THAT CONTROL CARDS HAVE THIS
CHARACTER IN COLUMN 1. WHEN IT IS DESIRED TO GIVE CONTROL TO THE CONSOLE
TYPEWRITER, SO THAT INPUT MAY BE MADE FROM IT, OR TO GIVE CONTROL BACK
FROM THE CONSOLE TYPEWRITER TO THE CARD-IMAGE DATASET, THEN THE CHARACTE
# (HEX 7B,PUNCH 3-8) IS USED IN COLUMN 1 TO EFFECT THE TRANSFER OF CONTR

PRINTING CONTROL STATEMENTS.

>>OPTIONAL INFORMATION    WILL CAUSE PRINTING TO STOP WHILE THE OPERATOR
×                         RESPONDS TO A CONSOLE TYPEWRITER MESSAGE TELLI
6E 6E                     HIM TO CHANGE STATIONERY, ETC. THE INFORMATION
                          FROM COLS 3-10 OF THE CONTROL CARD WILL APPEAR
                          IN THE MESSAGE.

                          ERROR MESSAGES. IF THIS STATEMENT IS NOT USED,
                          THEN ERROR MESSAGES ARE SUFFIXED WITH THE
                          RELATIVE NUMBER OF THE FORMAT HAVING THE ERROR

FORMAT CONTROL STATEMENTS.
     NOTE: UP TO 60 LINES ARE ALLOWED IN ANY ONE FORMAT. IF THE PROGRAM
CALCULATES THAT THE USER HAS TRIED TO SPECIFY MORE THAN 60 LINES BEFORE
TERMINATES THE FORMAT, IT WILL PRINT AN ERROR MESSAGE.

>AXC                    THE CHARACTER IN COL 3 WILL BE PRINTED IN EVERY

6E                      PRINT POSITIONS (SEE >S STATEMENT).  THE CHARACT
                        IN COL 4 WILL BE USED AS THE CARRIAGE CONTROL
                        CHARACTER FOR PRINTING THE LINE (SEE THE SECTION
                        ON CARRIAGE CONTROL)

6E                      COLUMN SPECIFIED BY DDD. THE CHARACTER C WILL BE
                        USED AS THE CARRIAGE CONTROL CHARACTER.
                        LEADING ZEROS MUST BE INCLUDED WHEN SPECIFYING D

6E                      BB TIMES.

                        NOTE:  AN >N STATEMENT MAY NOT APPEAR WITHIN A
                        GROUP OF STATEMENTS ALREADY SUBJECT TO AN >N

                        LEADING ZEROS. COMMAS MUST BE INSERTED BETWEEN D
                        FIELDS, BUT A COMMA MUST NOT FOLLOW THE LAST DDD
                        FIELD. THE CHARACTER C REPRESENTS THE CARRIAGE
                        CONTROL CHARACTER FOR THIS LINE, AND MUST BE
                        SPECIFIED. I.E. COL 4 ALWAYS REPRESENTS THE CC
                        CHARACTER. IF IT IS LEFT BLANK, THIS IS EQUIVALE
                        TO SINGLE-SPACING.

                        1-9. C WILL BE USED AS THE CC CHARACTER, AND WIL
                        ALWAYS OVERRIDE THE CC CHARACTER IN THE ORIGINAL
                        LINE, WHATEVER ITS VALUE.

                        ARE NOT REQUIRED.
                        NOTES:  ANY DATA ALREADY IN THE COLUMNS SPECIFIE
                        WILL BE OVERWRITTEN BY THE TEXT DATA. ONLY SINGL
                        IMBEDDED BLANKS ARE ALLOWED WITHIN THE TEXT DATA
                        IF MULTIPLE EMBEDDED BLANKS ARE REQUIRED, IT IS
                        SUGGESTED THAT THE 12-4-8 PUNCH(X'4C') IS USED T
                        REPRESENT THESE BLANKS. IF THERE IS DATA IN THE
                        ORIGINAL LINE WHICH FALLS WITHIN THE INSERTION
                        COLUMNS, AND IS REQUIRED TO BE KEPT, THEN IT MUS
                        BE PUNCHED WITHIN THE TEXT INFORMATION. (SEE
                        OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS).
                        THE PRIMARY USE OF THE >I STATEMENT IS TO COMPLE

6E                      OF THIS CARD IS UNNECESSARY.

DATA INPUT.
     IF THE FORMAT BEING DESIGNED HAS A MAXIMUM WIDTH OF 79 CHARACTERS,
THEN EACH LINE OF THE FORMAT CAN BE REPRESENTED ON ONE 80 COLUMN CARD
IMAGE, THE FIRST COLUMN BEING THE CC CHARACTER FOR THAT LINE. OTHERWISE,
IF THE FORMAT REQUIRES MORE THAN 79 PRINT POSITIONS PER LINE, TWO DATA
CARDS ARE REQUIRED FOR EACH LINE TO BE PRINTED.
     TO SPECIFY THAT ONLY 79 PRINT POSITIONS ARE BEING USED, A CONTROL
CARD WITH >S IN COLS 1-2 MUST PRECEDE ALL OTHER CONTROL AND DATA CARDS F
THAT FORMAT, AND ALSO MUST BE PRESENT FOR ANY OTHER FORMAT UTILISING THE
79 POSITION OPTION.
     HOWEVER, WHEN THE FULL WIDTH OF THE PRINT LINE IS REQUIRED, THEN TW
DATA CARDS ARE REQUIRED FOR EACH PRINT LINE. THE DATA FOR PRINT POSITION
2-80 ARE TAKEN FROM COLS 2-80 OF THE FIRST CARD, (COL 1 BEING THE CC
CHARACTER), AND PRINT POSITIONS 81-133 FROM COLS 1-53 OF THE SECOND CARD
     THE FIRST COLUMN OF THE FIRST CARD REPRESENTING A LINE IS THE CC
CHARACTER. IF IT IS LEFT BLANK, SINGLE SPACING IS ASSUMED. NOTE THAT THE
SECOND CARD HAS DATA IN COL 1.
     THE DATA IS CODED EXACTLY AS IT IS TO APPEAR ON THE PRINT LINE. ANY
PRINTABLE CHARACTER MAY BE CODED, AND MULTIPLE CONSECUTIVE BLANKS ARE
ALLOWED.

USING THE CONSOLE TYPEWRITER AS INPUT MEDIUM.

     ON OCCASION, IT MIGHT BE CONVENIENT TO SPECIFY THE CONTROL AND DATA
CARD-IMAGES FROM THE CONSOLE. TO GIVE CONTROL TO THE CONSOLE, A CONTROL
CARD WITH # (HEX 7B,PUNCH 3-8) PUNCHED IN COL 1 IS USED. IMMEDIATELY THI
CARD IS ENCOUNTERED, CONTROL IS GIVEN TO THE CONSOLE TYPEWRITER. WHEN TH
PROGRAM EXPECTS A REPLY FROM THE CONSOLE, IT WILL CAUSE A # (SHARP SIGN)
TO BE PRINTED ON THE CONSOLE.
     DATA IS ENTERED FROM THE CONSOLE IN CARD-IMAGE FORM. IF THE PROGRAM
DETECTS AN ERROR IN A REPLY, IT WILL ALLOW A RETRY. THIS WILL HAPPEN EVE
IF THE ERROR IS ONE WHICH HAS CAUSED MORE THAN THE MAXIMUM OF 60 LINES T
BE GENERATED, ALTHOUGH THE OPERATOR MIGHT NOT LOGICALLY BE ABLE TO CORRE
THIS TYPE OF ERROR, EXCEPT BY MAKING MULTIPLE INSERTIONS, ETC.
     WHEN THE OPERATOR DESIRES TO GIVE CONTROL BACK TO THE NEXT CARD-IMA
IN THE PRIMARY INPUT STREAM, HE NEED SIMPLY REPLY TO THE CONSOLE REQUEST
FOR DATA BY TYPING THE SAME CHARACTER, VI2 # (SHARP SIGN).
     CONTROL MAY BE TRANSFERRED FROM PRIMARY INPUT TO CONSOLE AND BACK
AGAIN AS OFTEN AS REQUIRED, AND AT ANY TIME WITHIN, BEFORE OR AFTER THE
SPECIFICATION OF A FORMAT.
     NOTE. ALL CONSOLE REPLIES ARE CONVERTED TO UPPER CASE BEFORE BEING
PRINTED, UNLESS THE >T STATEMENT HAS BEEN USED TO SPECIFY THE SN PRINT
TRAIN, WHEN CONSOLE REPLIES ARE PRINTED EXACTLY AS THEY ARE MADE.

CARRIAGE CONTROL CHARACTERS.

     MAKEFORM USES ASA CONTROL CHARACTERS, AS SHOWN
+             PRINT ON SAME LINE
  (SPACE)     PRINT ON NEXT LINE (SINGLE SPACING)
0 (ZERO)      PRINT AFTER 1 BLANK LINE (DOUBLE SPACING)
-             PRINT AFTER 2 BLANK LINES(TRIPLE SPACING)
1-8           PRINT AFTER ADVANCING TO CHANNEL 1-8
A-B           PRINT AFTER ADVANCING TO CHANNEL 10-11

     IF 2-8, OR A-B ARE USED, A CARRIAGE CONTROL TAPE MUST BE PROVIDED,
WITH THE APPROPRIATE CHANNELS PUNCHED.
     THE USE OF CC CHARACTERS DOES NOT AFFECT THE MAXIMUM LINE RULE, AS
ONLY COMPLETELY FORMATTED LINES ARE COUNTED. THEREFORE, ALTHOUGH A FORMA
MAY CONTAIN NOT MORE THAN 60 LINES, THESE MAY POSSIBLY BE SPREAD OVER MO
THAN ONE PAGE OF OUTPUT.

ERROR MESSAGES.

ENSURE SUFFICIENT DATA FOR EVENTUAL SETUP.

     OF THE CONSOLE MESSAGES DETAILED ABOVE, APPROPRIATE MESSAGES WILL B
REPRODUCED ON THE PRINTED OUTPUT. ALSO ON THE PRINTED OUTPUT WILL APPEAR
THE FIRST FOUR COLS OF THE CARD IN ERROR, THEN THE AREA OF THE CARD IN
ERROR, THEN THE WORD ***INVALID***. NOTE THAT THE AREA SHOWN AS BEING IN
ERROR MIGHT NOT HAVE AN ERROR WHEN CONSIDERED ON ITS OWN, BUT COULD HAVE
AN ERROR AS A RESULT OF AN EARLIER COLUMN ON THE STATEMENT. WHEN AN ERRO
IS DETECTED, THE PROGRAM WILL FLUSH REMAINING STATEMENTS LOOKING FOR
ERRORS, AND WILL PRINT ONLY ONE COPY OF THE FORMAT, AS GENERATED SO FAR.
IF FURTHER FORMATS ARE INCLUDED IN THE INPUT DECK, THEY WILL BE TREATED
FOLLOWS:-  IF THE HOLD (>H) FUNCTION HAS BEEN SPECIFIED, THEY WILL BE
CHECKED FOR ERRORS, AND ONLY 1 COPY PRINTED. IF NOT, AND THE FORMATS ARE
FREE FROM ERROR, THEN THE REQUESTED NUMBER OF COPIES IS PRINTED. SOME
COMMON CAUSES OF ERROR ARE DETAILED:-

 *   A >T CONTROL STATEMENT IS ENTERED WHEN THE OUTPUT FROM THE RUN IS N
     GOING DIRECTLY TO A PRINTER WITH THE UCS FEATURE. THE NAME OF THE
     TRAIN IS PRINTED IN THE ERROR MESSAGE

 *   AN INVALID CONTROL CARD IS SPECIFIED.  THE CODE IS SPECIFIED IN THE
     ERROR MESSAGE

 *   THE COLUMNS SPECIFIED IN AN >F STATEMENT ARE NOT 3 DIGITS LONG, OR
     ARE NOT NUMERIC, OR ARE NOT SEPARATED BY COMMAS, OR THE LAST COLUMN
     SPECIFIED IS NOT TERMINATED BY A BLANK.

 *   COMMAS ARE NOT USED CORRECTLY WHERE THEY ARE REQUIRED AS DELIMITERS
     IN CONTROL STATEMENTS.

 *   TWO CONSECUTIVE COMMAS ARE FOUND IN A CONTROL STATEMENT

 *   A COLUMN SPECIFICATION IS GREATER THAN 133

 *   A LINE SPECIFICATION IS GREATER THAN 60

 *   TWO CONSECUTIVE DATA CARDS ARE NOT FOUND WHEN TWO DATA CARDS ARE
     REQUIRED FOR EACH PRINT LINE.  THE BEGINNING OF THE CONTROL CARD
     FOUND INSTEAD WILL BE PRINTED IN THE ERROR MESSAGE.

     NUMERIC DATA.

SOME OPERATIONAL CONSIDERATIONS.

     IF SYSOUT IS SPECIFIED FOR THE OUTPUT FROM MAKEFORMS, SUFFICIENT
SPACE SHOULD BE ALLOCATED FOR THE TOTAL OUTPUT. OTHER POINTS WORTH
CONSIDERING WHEN SYSOUT IS USED ARE THAT THE STATIONERY CHANGE OPTION
(>> 2X'6E',PUNCH 0-6-8), AND THE UCS TRAIN CHANGE OPTION DO NOT APPLY.

     IF IT IS KNOWN THAT ALL THE FORMATS WITHIN A RUN REQUIRE THE SAME
PRINT TRAIN, BUT IT IS NOT STANDARD FOR THE INSTALLATION, THEN IT IS WOR
SPECIFYING THE REQUIRED TRAIN ON THE DD STATEMENT RATHER THAN USING THE
>T STATEMENT.
 E.G.  //FORMS DD UNIT=1403,UCS=(SN,,VERIFY)

     MAKEFORM, SINCE IT BUILDS UP TO 60 LINES, DOES NOT SUPPORT A FULL
PAGE OF PRINTOUT AT 8 LINES TO THE INCH. NEITHER, SINCE INSERTIONS MAY B
MADE TO PREVIOUSLY FORMATTED LINES, DOES IT RUN SUCCESSFULLY USING DSO.

      IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT EACH TIME A >DEL CARD IS ENCOUNTERED,
AUTOMATIC SETUP IS PERFORMED. THIS MEANS THAT IF MORE THAN 999 OF ONE
FORMAT IS BEING PRODUCED BY USING THE >H FUNCTION, THEN THERE WILL BE SO
SETUP DATA AFTER THE 999TH FORM AND MULTIPLES THEREOF.
     THE AUTOMATIC SETUP CONSISTS OF A ROW OF 1S, WHICH INDICATE TO THE
OPERATOR WHERE CHANNEL 1, NORMALLY THE TOP OF THE PAGE, IS TO BE ALIGNED
     THE FIRST LINE OF EACH DOCUMENT OR FORMAT SHOULD NORMALLY HAVE A 1
THE CARRIAGE CONTROL CHARACTER.

     GREAT CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN WHEN REPEATING CARD-IMAGES, OR GROUPS OF
CARD-IMAGES, (>R AND >N), TO ENSURE THAT THE IMAGES BEING REPEATED DO NO
CONTAIN UNWANTED CC CHARACTERS.

     REMEMBER THAT A DATA CARD WITH A CC CHARACTER OF -, GIVES THE SAME
RESULT AS HAVING A >B2 CARD PRECEDING THE DATA CARD AND A SPACE FOR THE
CHARACTER IN THE DATA CARD.

     COMMENTS MAY BE WRITTEN ON ALL CONTROL CARDS, UNDER THE FOLLOWING
RULE. ALL CONTROL STATEMENTS ARE DELIMITED BY TWO CONSECUTIVE BLANKS,
AFTER WHICH COMMENTS MAY BE PUNCHED IN THE REMAINDER OF THE CARD.

     WHEN USING A 12-4-8 PUNCH AS A FILL CHARACTER, IT MAY BE FOUND THAT
IT DOES IN FACT PRINT AS SOME CHARACTER ON THE OUTPUT. THE INSTALLATION
SYSTEMS PROGRAMMER SHOULD BE CONSULTED TO FIND A SUBSTITUTE.
