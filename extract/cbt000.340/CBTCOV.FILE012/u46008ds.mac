1.  A SCAN OF THE PARM FIELD INFORMATION IS MADE FOR AN ASTERISK, WHICH
    INDICATES THE END OF THE IEFIRC PARM INFORMATION AND THE START OF TH
    SWZ06RDR PARM INFORMATION
2A. P.D.S. OPTION MEMBER INPUT MODE.
    WHEN THE ASTERISK HAS BEEN FOUND, AND THE MODULE IS IN MEMBER INPUT
    THE THIRD AND FOURTH BYTES OF SWZ06RDR PARM INFORMATION ARE EXTRACTE
    AND PREFIXED TO THE WORD OPTION. A SEARCH OF IEFCNTRL DATA SET IS
      THEN MADE FOR A MEMBER NNOPTION, WHICH WILL CONTAIN THE J.C.L. SEL
    OPTIONS TO BE COMPARED AGAINST CARD VOLUMES 73 TO 80.
3.  HAVING FOUND NNOPTION, AN IN-CORE OPTION TABLE IS UILT WITH THE AID
    GETMAIN.
2B. PARM FIELD OPTION INPUT MODE.
    WHEN IN PARM FIELD INPUT MODE, THE J.C.L. SELECTION OPTIONS ARE EXPE
    TO BE IN THE PARM FIELD AFTER THE MEMBER NAME. ROUTINES 2A AND 3 ABO
    NOT APPLY.
4.  HAVING DETERMINED THE INPUT MODE AND AQUIRED THE RELEVANT OPTIONS, A
    SEARCH OF THE IEFCNTRL DATA SET IS MADE FOR THE MEMBER SPECIFIED IN
    PARM FIELD.
59  WHEN THE MEMBER HAS BEEN FOUND, THE FIRST TWO BYTES OF THE FIRST REC
    ARE COMPARED TO // TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT IT IS A J.C.L. MEMBER
    FOLLOWING ACTION IS TAKEN ACCORDINGLY:
    IF FIRST 2 BYTES = // GO TO ROUTINE 6 BELOW,
    IF FIRST 2 BYTES ARE BOT = // GOTO ROUTINE 7 BELOW.
6.  EACH RECORD OF THE J.C.L. MEMBER HAS CARD COLUMNS 73 TO 80 INCLUSIVE
    COMPARED WITH BLANKS AND ALL OF THE OPTIONS IN THE OPTION TABLE. WHE
    MATCH IS FOUND THE RECORD IS WRITTEN TO THE IEFRDIR DATA SET. OPTION
    COMPARED IN TWO WAYS; IN MEMBER INPUT MODE THE MATCH HAS TO BE ACROS
    ENTIRE EIGHT BYTES, BUT IN PARM INPUT MODE THE MATCH ONLY HAS TO BE
    ANY ONE OF THE EIGHT BETWEEN 73 AND 80.
7.  A TABLE OF MEMBER TTR ADDRESS IS BUILT IN CORE WITH THE AID OF GETMA
    BIDL AND EACH MEMBER IS PROCESSED BY ROUTINE 6 ABOVE.
8.  WHEN ALL MEMBERS HAVE BEEN PROCESSED, TWO COURSES OF ACTION ARE OPEN
    MODULE IS IN NORMAL O.S. MODE, A LINK TO IEFIRC IS EFFECTED BEFORE
    TERMINATION. IF THE MODULE IS IN H.A.S.P. MODE IEFIRC IS NOT LINKED,
    THE H.A.S.P. EOF INDICATOR IS WRITTEN TO IEFRDER BEFORE TERMINATION.
