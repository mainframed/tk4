The VTAMCTCA program provides a method of connecting SNA terminals
to a VM system. It is a VTAM application program, and performs the
connection by simulating VM/PASSTHROUGH FACILITY,
which is an IBM Program Product ( 5748-RC1 ) .

There are a couple of prerequisites...
 1) VM/PASSTHROUGH must be installed on the VM system.
 2) VM/PASSTHROUGH must be connected by a real or virtual
    channel-to-channel adapter to an MVS system containing VTAM.
