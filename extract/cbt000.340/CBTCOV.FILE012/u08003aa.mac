1.    A PROGRAM IS NOW AVAILABLE WHICH WILL PROCESS OPERATOR COMMANDS
      FROM A PROBLEM PROGRAM PARTITION.
2.    THE PROGRAM MAY BE EXECUTED IN TWO WAYS :-
           (A) AS A SEPARATE JOB STEP. THE JCL REQUIRED FOR THIS IS
               //SNN  EXEC  PGM = SYRLSE, PARM = 'COMMAND'
               WHERE COMMAND IS THE COMMAND DESIRED, E.G. 'A TO JOBNAME'
               TO RELEASE A JOB.
               NOTE: SYMBOLIC PARAMETERS COULD BE USED.
           (B) AS A SUBROUTINE. THE CODING REQUIRED FOR THIS (IN
               COBOL) IS
                   CALL  'SYRLSE'  USING DATANAME.
               WHERE DATANAME IS THE NAME OF A DATA AREA SET UP AS
               FOLLOWS
                        C     COMMAND
               WHERE C IS A BINARY HALFWORD WHOSE VALUE IS THE LENGTH IN
               BYTES OF COMMAND. COMMAND IS AS IN (A).
3.    SYRLSE IS HELD IN SYS1.LINKLIB.
4.    USERS OF SYRLSE. THE PRINCIPLE USE IS TO CONTROL THE RUNNING OF
      DEPENDENT JOBS. ALL JOBS ARE RUN INTO MACHINE TOGETHER WITH
      TYPERUN=HOLD CODED FOR EACH JOB EXCEPT THE FIRST. THE LAST PROGRAM
      IN EACH JOB WILL CALL SYRLSE, PASSING AS A PARAMETER THE COMMAND T
      RELEASE THE NEXT JOB FROM THE HOLD QUEUE.
5.    ANY OPERATOR COMMAND MAY BE ISSUED. THE COMMANDS ARE LISTED, WITH
      THEIR FORMAT AND OPERANDS IN C8-6540-8 OPERATORS GUIDE, PAGES 40 -
