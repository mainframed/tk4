                                   FLOWEDIT
I.   FUNCTION
THE FLOWEDIT PROGRAM IS A UTILITY WHICH PROVIDES SUPPORT FOR THE
TRACE SERVICE AID TFLOW. THIS UTILITY FORMATS AND PRINTS THE TRACE
OUTPUT DATA FROM TFLOW;  THE PROGRAM OPERATES AS A PROBLEM PROGRAM
UNDER 0S/360 AND REQUIRES ANOUT 10 K OF MAIN STORAGE FOR EXECUTION.
A.   FEATURES
FLOWEDIT PROVIDES A MANUAL CONTROL FACILITY WHICH ALLOWS THE SYSTEM
OPERATOR TO MANUALLY CONTROL THE INPUT TAPE POSITION. IF THE MANUAL
CONTROL OPTION IS SELECTED, A MESSAGE IS WRITTEN TO THE CONSOLE WHICH
INFORMS THE OPERATOR THAT HE MAY REPLY AT ANY TIME WITH A BLOCK
NUMBER TO WHICH THE INPUT TAPE WILL BE POSITIONED. THE MANUAL CONTROL
FEATURE CAN BE USED TO SELECTIVELY PRINT SECTIONS OF THE TFLOW OUTPUT
TAPE.
THE USER OF FLOWEDIT MAY SPECIFY A BLOCK NUMBER AT WHICH THE EDITING
PROCESS IS TO BEGIN, AS WEEL AS THE COUNT OF PRINTED LINES PER PAGE
OF OUTPUT.
FLOWEDIT HAS THE CAPABILITY OF BECOMING A VERY SPECIALISED DATA
REDUCTION PROGRAM THROUGH THE USE OF A USER WRITTEN EXIT PROGRAMS.
AN EXIT TO A USER WRITTEN PROGRAM CAN BE TAKEN AS EACH TRACE ENTRY
IS PRINTED BY FLOWEDIT. THE USER PROGRAM CAN THEN EXAMINE THE TRACE
DATA AND TAKE ACTION BASED ON THIS EXAMINATION. INFORMATION IS
PROVIDED IN THE EXIT PARAMETER LIST WHICH ALLOWS THE USER PROGRAM TO
CONTROL THE INPUT DEVICE AND ADD NOTATIONS TO THE OUTPUT LISTING. ON
RETURN FROM THE EXIT, CONTINUATION OF PROCESSING IS GOVERNED BY THE
VALUE OF THE RETURN CODE FROM THE USER EXIT PROGRAM. THE USER
PROGRAM DIRECT FLOWEDIT TO TAKE THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS:
1.   PRINT CURRENT RECORD AND CONTINUE PROCESSING
2.   CONTINUE PROCESSING BUT SUPPRESS PRINTING OF CURRENT TRACE RECORD
3.   CONTINUE PROCESSING, BUT NO LONGER ONVOKE THE USER PROGRAM
4. TERMINATE FLOWEDIT PROCESSING
B.  CONSIDERATIONS
THE OUTPUT OF TFLOW MAY BE COLUMINOUS;  IT IS ADISABLE TO ALLOCATE
A PRINTER TO THE FLOWEDIT OUTPUT FILE RATHER THAN ALLOW THIS OUTPUT
TO BE PROCESED BY AN OUTPUT WRITER. THE COLUME OF TFLOW OUTPUT
CANNOT BE PREDICTED BECAUSE IT IS DEPENDENT UPON THE NUMBER OF
INTERRUPTS WHICH OCCUR WHILE TFLOW IS EXECUTING AND THE OPTIONS
SELECTED FOR TFLOW.
THE MANUAL CONTROL FEATURE IS NOT AVAILABLE ON PCP SYSTEMS.
11.   OPERATIONS
A.   APPLICATION
FLOWEDIT EXECUTES AS A PROBLEM PROGRAM IN OS/360.  THE PROGRAM IS
SUPPLIED IN OBJECT MODULE FORM. THE FOLLOWING JCL MAY BE USED TO
LINK-EDIT THE FLOWEDIT OBJECT DDECK INTO A TEMPORARY LIBRARY FROM WHICH
IT CAN BE EXECURED:
//PTFSAPGM  JOB  R18,SAPGM,MSGLELEV=1   10/17/69
//STEP1     EXEC PGM=IEWL,PARM='LIST,XREF'
//SYSPRINT  DD   SYSOUT=A
//SYSUT1    DD   UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(1024,(50,20))
//SYSLMOD   DD   DSN=&SERVLIB,DISP=(,PASS),     X
//          UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(1024,(10,1,1))
//SYSLIN    DD
    FLOWEDIT OBJECT DECK
    NAME FLOWEDT(R)
B.   EXECUTION
THE EXECUTION OF FLOWEDIT IS GOVERNED BY PARAMETERS PASSED TO THE
PROGRAM FROM THE PARM FIELD OF THE EXEC CARD. THESE PARAMETERS ARE
KEYWORDS WHICH HAVE THE FOLLOWING MEANING:
MSG=YES  THE MESSAGE (MSG) PARAMETER INDICATES WHETHER OR NOT MANUAL
    NO  CONTROL OF THE INPUT TAPE IS DESIRED. WHEN MSG=YES IS CODED,
         THE MESSAGE:
FLOWEDIT-YOU MAY REPLY AT ANY TIME CONTROL SYSUT1
IS WRITTEN TO THE SYSTEM CONSOLE.  FLOWEDIT PROCESSING CONTINUES UNTIL A
REPLY TO THIS MESSAGE IS GIVEN;  THE OPERATOR REPLIES WHEN IT IS DESIRED
THAT PROCESSING BEGIN AT A NEW BLOCK ON THE INPUT TAPE.  BY REPLYING
WITH A DECIMAL NUMBER, THE OPERATOR CAN CAUSE THE FLOWEDIT PROGRAM
TO POSITION THE INPUT TAPE TO THAT BLOCK NUMBER.  BOTH FORWARD AND
BACKWARD SPACING IS POSSIBLE.  FLOWEDIT PROCESSING MAY BE TERMINATED
BY REPLY 'END' TO THIS CONTROL MESSAGE.
SHOULD MSG=NO BE CODED, OR IF THE PARAMETER IS OMITTED ENTIRELY, THE
MANUAL CONTROL OPTION IS NOT PROVIDED.  THE MESSAGE PARAMETER MAY BE
ABREVIATED WITH CHARACTER M, FOR EXAMPLE, M=NO.  THIS PARAMETER
IS IGNORED IN PCP SYSTEMS.
BLOCK NO=DECIMAL NUMBER (OF UP TO 4 DIGITS)
THE BLOCK NUMBER PARAMETER SPECIFIED THE BLOCK NUMBER IN THE INPUT DATA
SET AT WHICH FLOWEDIT PROCESSING IS TO BEGIN.  IF THIS PARAMETER IS
OMITTED, THE VALUE 1 IS ASSUMED, AND PROCESSING BEGINS WITH THE FIRST
OMITTED, THE VALUE 1 IS ASSUMED, AND PROCESSING BEGINS WITH THE FIRST
BLOCK ON THE INPUT TAPE.  THE BLOCK NO KEYWORD MAY BE ABREVIATED WITH
THE C¤RACTER B.
LINECT=DECIMAL NUMBER (OF UP TO 2 DIGITS)
THIS PARAMETER DESCRIBES THE NUMBER OF LINES TO BE PRINTED PER PAGE
OF FLOWEDIT OUTPUT. IF A USER EXIT PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO ADD NOTATIONS
TO THE FLOWEDIT OUTPUT, THE VALUE OF THE LINE COUNT PARAMETER CAN BE
REDUCED TO PROVIDE FOR THE ADDITIONAL LINES BEING PRINTED. THE
CHARACTER L SERVES AS AN ABBREVIATION FOR LINECT. IF THE LINECT PAR
PARAMETER IS OMITTED, THE VALUE 50 IS USED FOR FLOWEDIT EXECUTION.
USR=LOAD MODULE NAME OF EXIT PROGRAM (UP TO 8 CHARACTERS)
THE PARAMETER DEFINES A USER EXIT PROGRAM WHICH IS TO BE LOAD-ED AND
INVOKED BY FLOWEDIT AS EACH TRACE RECORD IS PROCESSED.  IF THIS PARAMETE
DOES NOT APPEAR, IT IS ASSUMED THAT NO EXIT PROGRAM IS PROVIDED. THE
KEYWORD USR MAY BE SHORTENED TO U.

                           THIS STATEMENT SPECIFIES THE PROGRAM TO
                           BE EXECUTED.  THE OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
                           INDICATED IN THE PARM FIELD CONTROL FLOWEDIT
                           EXECUTION.  MSG INDICATES WHETHER OR NOT
                           MANUAL CONTROL IS DESIRED;  THE XXXX VALUE
                           IS A DECIMAL NUMBER WHICH GIVES THE  STARTING
                           BLOCK NUMBER.  YY, IN THE LINECT PARAMETER.
                           GOVES THE NUMBER OF LINES PER PAGE OF
                           OUTPUT.  IF A USER EXIT PROGRAM IS TO BE
                           USED, CCCCCCCC IN THE USR PARAMETER IS
                           REPLACED NBY THE USER EXIT LOAD MODULE NAME.
//SYSPRINT   DD            THE SYSPRINT DD CARD DEFINES THE FLOWEDIT
                           OUTPUT DATA SET.  IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT
                           THE OUTPUT DEVICE BE DIRECTLY SPECIFIED,
                           AS IN UNIT=00E, RATHER THAN ALLOW THE
                           FLOWEDIT OUTPUT TO BE PROCESSED BY AN
                           OUTPUT WRITER.  THIS IS DONE BECAUSE OF
                           THE VOLUMINOUS NATURE WHICH THE TFLOW
                           OUTPUT MAY HAVE.
//SYSUT1     DD            THIS STATEMENT DEFINES THE FLOWEDIT INPUT
                           DATA SET.
2.   USER EXIT PROGRAMS
THROUGH USER WRITTEN EXIT PROGRAMS, FLOWEDIT BECOMES A SPECIALISED DATA
REDUCTION PROGRAM.  AFTER EACH TRACE ENTRY IS FORMATTED, CONTROL MAY BE
PASSED TO A USER EXIT PROGRAM.  THIS EXIT CAN THEN EXAMINE THE TRACE
DATA AND SELECT ONLY THAT INFORMATION WHICH IS RELEVANT TO THE PARTICULA
APPLICATION.
THE USER EXIT PROGRAM MUST BE ASSEMBLED AND LINE-EDITED INTO A USER'S
LIBRARY, A TEMPORARY LIBRARY OR INTO SYS1.LINKLIB.  FLOWEDIT WILL THEN
LOAD THE EXIT AND PASS CONTROL TO IT AS EACH RECORD IS PROCESSED.  ON
ENTRY TO THE USER PROGRAM, GENERAL REGISTER 1 ADDRESSES A FOUR WORD
PARAMETER LIST.  THIS LIST HAS THE FOLLOWING FORMAT:
THE FIRST WORD OF THE USER EXIT PARAMETER LIST CONTAINS THE ADDRESS OF
THE FORMATTED TRACE RECORD WHICH IS READY FOR OUTPUT.  THE 32-BYTE
TFLOW TRACK RECORD IN UNFORMATTED FORM IS ADDRESSED BY THE SECOND WORD
OF THE PARAMETER LIST.  TO PROVIDE THE USER EXIT WITH THE CAPABILITY
OF WRITING NOTATIONS IN THE FLOWEDIT OUTPUT LISTING AND TO ALLOW THE
PROGRAM TO CONTROL THE POSITIONING OF THE INPUT TAPE, THE ADDRESSES
OF THE FLOWEDIT OUTPUT AND INPUT DCB'S ARE PROVIDED AS WORDS 3 AND 4
OF THE PARAMETER LIST.
THE INPUT AND OUTPUT DCB'S IN FLOWEDIT ARE CODED AS FOLLOWS.  THIS
INFORMATION IS PROVIDED SO THAT USER EXIT PRPGRAMS CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THE FLOWEDIT SET UP TO DO THEIR OWN I/O OPERATIONS.
OUTPUT DCB
DCBDDNAME=YSSPRINT,DSORG=PS,MACRF=(PM)
    BLKSIZE=133,LRECL=133,RECFM=FA
INPUT DCB
DCBDDNAME=SYSUT1,DSORG=PS,MACRF=(RC),
    BLKSIZE=3200,RECFM=F,NCP=2,BUFNO=2,
    DEVD=TA
WHEN THE USER EXIT IS INVOKED BY FLOWEDIT, THE CONTENTS OF THE GENERAL
REGISTERS SHOULD  BE STORES IN THE SAVE AREA ADDRESSED BY REGISTER 13
IN KEEPING WITH STANDARD SUBROUTINE LINKAGE CONVENTION.  THE REGISTERS
SHOULD THEN BE RESTORED BEFORE RETURN TO FLOWEDIT IS MADE.  RETURN TO
FLOWEDIT SHOULD BE MADE AT THE ADDRESS GIVEN IN GENERAL REGISTER 14.
CODE.  THE VALUE OF THIS RETURN CODE DETERMINES THE SUBSEQUENT ACTION
TO BE TAKEN BY FLOWEDIT.  THE POSSIBLE VALUES WHICH ARE ACCEPTABLE
RETURN CODES AND THE CORRESPONDING ACTION TAKEN BY FLOWEDIT ARE GIVEN
BELOW.
RETURN CODE VALUE                    ACTION

3.   EXAMPLES
EXAMPLE 1 MAKES USE OF THE MANUAL CONTROL FEATURE OF FLOWEDIT.
POSITIONING OF THE INPUT TAPE CAN BE MANUALLY CONTROLLED FROM THE SYSTEM
CONSOLE.  THE JCL GIVEN HERE CAN BE APPENDED TO THE LINK-EDIT JCL GIVEN
IN SECTION II-A.
EXAMPLE 1
//STEP2      EXEC   PGM=FLOWEDIT,PARM='MSG=YES'
//STEPLIB    DD     DSN=&SERVLIB,DISP=(OLD,DELETE)
//SYSPRINT   DD     UNIT=00E
//SYSUT1     DD     UNIT=2400,LABEL=(,NL),VOL=SER=TFLOWT,
             DISP=OLD
STEP 2: THIS EXEC STATEMENT REFERS TO THE FLOWEDIT LOAD MODULE PRODUCED
BY THE LINKAGE-EDITOR IN STEP 1.  THE FLOWEDIT PARAMETER SPECIFIED
INDICATES THAT MANUAL CONTROL OF THE INPUT DATA SET IS TO BE MAINTAINED
BY CONSOLE COMMAND.
STEPLIB: THE STEPLIB CARD DESCRIBES THE DATA SET CONTAINING THE FLOWEDIT
LOAD MODULE.
SYSPRINT: THE SYSPRINT DD CARD DESCRIBES THE DEVICE WHICH IS TO RECEIVE
THE FLOWEDIT OUTPUT.
SYSUT1: THIS STATEMENT DEFINES THE INPUT TAPE; IN THIS CASE, TFLOW
OUTPUT WAS TO NON-LAVELED TAPE.
EXAMPLE 2
//STEP2      EXEC   PGM=IEWL,PARM='LIST,XREF'
//SYSPRINT   DD     SYSPUT=A
//SYSUT1     DD     UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(1024,(50,20))
//SYSLMOD    DD     DSN=&SERVLIB,DISP=(OLD,PASS)
//SYSLIN     DD     *

//STEPLIB    DD     DSN=&SERVLIB,DISP=(OLD,DELETE)
//SYSPRINT   DD     SYSOUT=A
//SYSUT1     DD     UNIT=2400,LABEL=(,NL),
//           VOL=SER=TFLOWT,DISP=OLD
SUPPOSE THAT A USER EXIT PROGRAM HAS BEEN WRITTEN WHICH ADDS A LINE OF
INFORMATION TO EACH OUTPUT LINE OVER A BLOCK OF TFLOW TRACE RECORDS
EXAMPLE 2 SHOWS JCL WHICH MAY BE USED TO EXECUTE FLOWEDIT AND HAVE THE
USER EXIT PROGRAM NAMED EXITPGM BE INVOKED.  THESE CONTROL CARDS CAN BE
APPENDED TO THE APPLICATION JCL GIVEN IN IIA.
STEP 2: THIS STEP INVOKES THE LINKAGE-EDITOR TO PROCESS THE EXIT PROGRAM
OBJECT DECK AND PLACE THE LOAD MODULE IN THE TEMPORARY DATA SET DEFINED
IN THE SYSLMOD DD CARD IN STEP'&SERVLIB.  THE LOAD MODULE IS GIVEN THE
NAME EXITPGM.
STEP 3: THIS EXEC CARD INVOKES FLOWEDIT.  THE FLOWEDIT PARAMETERS
SPECIFIED INDICATE THE USER EXIT PROGRAM NAME AND THE COUTN OF LINES
PER PAGE OF INPUT--THE LINE COUNT OF 25 WAS SPECIFIED TO PROVIDE FOR
INSERTION OF LINES BY THE EXOT PROGRAM.
STEPLIB: THE STEPLIB DD CARD DEFINES THE DATA SET CONTAINING FLOWEDIT
AND THE USER EXIT PROGRAM.
SYSPRINT: THIS STATEMENT DEFINES THE FLOWEDIT OUTPUT DATA SET.
SYSUT1: THIS STATEMENT DEFINES THE INPUT DATA SET.
C.   OUTPUT
FLOWEDIT PRINTS EACH TFLOW TRACE ENTRY AS A LINE IN THE OUTPUT LISTING.
EACH LINE IS LABELLED ACCORDING TO TYPE OF TRACE RECORD.  EACH TRACE
RECORD CONTAINS A COUNTER VALUE WHICH IS PRONTED WITH THE OUTPUT LINE.
THIS VALUE IS USED TO NOTE THE OCCURRENCE OF UNTRACED INTERRUPTS.  THE
COUNTER IS INCREMENTED BY TFLOW FOR EACH INTERRUPT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER
OR NOT THE INTERRUPT IS TRACED.  DURING FLOWEDIT PROCESSING, THIS COUNTE
IS TESTED; IF THE COUNTER VALUE DOES NOT INCREMENT BY 1, FLOWEDIT MARKS
THE CURRENT TRACE ENTRY TO INDICATE THAT INTERRUPTS OCCURRED WHICH WERE
NOT TRACED.  SUCH A SITUATION OCCURS IN CASE FETCH OR PCI INTERRUPTS
ARE NOT BEING TRACED.  THIS MARKING APPEARS AS AN ASTERISK NEXT TO THE
COUNTER VALUE IN THE OUTPUT LINE.
THE POSSIBLE TYPES OF TRACE ENTRIES ARE DESCRIBED SEPARATELY BELOW.
SAMPLES OF THE TYPES OF TRACE ENTRIES ARE CONTAINED IN THE "SAMPLE
OUTPUT" SECTION OF THIS DOCUMENT.
D.   FLOWEDIT MESSAGES
1.   OPERATOR MESSAGES (WRITTEN TO SYSTEM CONSOLE)
1.1  FLOWEDIT-CANNOT OPEN SYSPRINT
EXPLANATION:  THE PROGRAM ATTEMPTED TO OPEN THE OUTOUT DCB AND FOUND THA
THIS FUNCTION COULD NOT BE PERFORMED.  IN MOST CASES, THIS FAILURE IS
DUW TO THE USER NOT HAVING SUPPLIED A SYSPRINT DD CARD.  FLOWEDIT
EXECUTION IS TERMINATED.
USER RESPONSE:  SUPPLY THE SYSPRINT DD CARD AND RESUBMIT THE JOB.
1.2  FLOWEDIT-YOU MAY REPLY AT ANY TIME TO CONTROL SYSUT1
EXPLANATION:  IF THE MANUAL CONTROL OPTION IS SPECIFIED BY CODING MSG=YE
AS A FLOWEDIT PARAMETER, THEN THIS MESSAGE IS WRITTEN TO THE SYSTEM
CONSOLE.  BE REPLY TO THIS MESSAGE THE USER CAN CONTROL POSITIONING OF
THE INPUT TAPE.  THE FOLLOWING DESCRIBES THE POSSIBLE REPLIES:
A.   BY SPECIFYING A DECIMAL INTEGER OF UP TO FOUR DIGITS, THE USER CAN
DIRECT FLOWEDIT TO STOP PROCESSING THE CURRENT TRACE ENTRY BLOCK AND
POSITION THE INPUT TAPE TO THE BLOCK SPECIFIED.  PROCESSING BEGINS
AGAIN AT THIS NEW BLOCK.  BOTH FORWARD AND BACKWARD SPACING ARE POSSIBLE
B.   THE USER MAY REPLY WITH END TO TERMINATE PROCESSING.
C.   A REPLY OF ABE CAUSES FLOWEDIT TO TERMINATE WITH A USER 1000 ABEND
CODE.  A STORAGE DUMP WILL BE WRITTEN TO THE DATA SET DEFINED BY A
SYSUDUMP OR SYSABEND DD CARD.  SUCH A DD CARD SHOULD BE INCLUDED IF THIS
FUNCTION IS TO BE USED.  THE GENERATED DUMP IS ESPECIALLY USEFUL IN
DEBUGGING USER EXIT PROGRAMS.
1.3  FLOWEDIT-ERROR IN BLOCK NO. REPLY WITH A 1 TO 9 DIGIT NUMERIC
DECIMAL TO BEGIN PRINTING AT A SPECIFIED RECORD.
EXPLANTION:  THE PROGRAM A DETERMINED THAT A REPLY TO THE MANUAL CONTROL

OF THE EXEC CARD AND RESUBMIT THE JOB.
2.A.2  LINECT PARM NOT GIVEN WHEN EXPECTED, EXCEEDS LENGTH OF TWO
DIGITS, OR IS NON-DECIMAL.  DEFAULT VALUE USED.
EXPLANTION:  DURING THE SCAN OF THE PARAMETER LIST, THE PROGRAM
DISCOVERED AN ERROR IN THE VALUE OF THE LINECT COUNT PARAMETER.  A
DEFAULT VALUE IS OF 50 IS SUBSTITUTED FOR THE ERRONEOUS VALUE AND THE
SCAN CONTINUES.
USER RESPONSE: CHECK THE VALUE SPECIFIED IN THE LINECT PARAMETER AND
RESUBMIT THE JOB.
2.A.3  FLOWEDIT EXECUTION TERMINATED UPON USER'S REQUEST
EXPLANATION:  FLOWEDIT EXECUTION WAS TERMINATED BECAUSE THE USER REPLIED
END TO THE MANUAL CONTROL MESSAGE.
2.A.4  FLOWEDIT PROCESSING TERMINATED BY USER EXIT
EXPLANATION:  THE USER EXIT PROGRAM RETURNED A CODE 12 WHICH COMMANDS
FLOWEDIT TO TERMINATE PROCESSING.
2.A.5  FLOWEDIT ERROR RECORD IGNORED
EXPLANATION:  THE SYNAD ROUTINE WAS ENTERED WHILE FLOWEDIT WAS ATTEMPTIN
TO READ A BLOCK FROM THE SYSUT1 DATA SET.
PROGRAM ACTION:  THE PROGRAM IGNORES THE LAST RECORD AND MAKES THE ABOVE
NOTATION IN THE OUTPUT LISTING TO WARN OF THIS ACTION.  IF SYNAD IS
ENTERED ON THREE SUCCESSIVE READ OPERATIONS, MESSAGE 2.B.4 IS ISSUED
AND EXECUTION IS TERMINATED.
B.   TERMINAL ERROR MESSAGE
2.B.1  USER EXIT NAME NOT GIVEN WHEN EXPECTED OR EXCEEDS EIGHT
CHARACTERS.  FLOWEDIT EXECUTION TERMINATED
EXPLANTION:  THERE IS A SYNTAX IN THE USE PARAMETER.  WITHER THE
CHARACTER 'U' BEGINS AN INVALID KEYWORD OR THE EXIT PROGRAM NAME IS
LONGER THAN EIGHT CHARACTERS.
USER RESPONSE:  CHECK THE PARAMETER LIST IN THE PARM FIELD ON THE
EXEC CARD AND RESUBMIT THE JOB.
2.B.2  BLOCK NUMBER PARM NOT GIVEN WHEN EXPECTED, EXCEEDS FOUR DIGIT
LIMIT, OR IN NON-DECIMAL. FLOWEDIT EXECUTION TERMINATED.
EXPLANATION:  THE BLOCKNO PARAMETER MUST BE SPECIFIED AS A DECIMAL
INTEGER OF MAXIMAL OF 4 DIGITS.  EITHER THE BLOCK NUMBER VALUE IS
INCORRECTLY SPECIFIED OT THE CHARACTER 'B' BEGINS AN INVALID KEYWORD.
USER RESPONSE: CHECK THE PARAMETER LIST IN THE PARM FIELD ON THE
EXEC CARD AND RESUBMIT THE JOB.
2.B.3  FLOWEDIT CANNOT OPEN FILE SYSUT1, NO DD CARD
EXPLANATION:  FLOWEDIT ATTEMPTED TO OPEN THE INPUT DCB BUT THIS OPERATIO
COULD NOT BE PERFORMED.
USER RESPONSE:  SUPPLY THE SYSUT1 DD CARD DESCRIPING THE INPUT DATA
SET AND RESUBMIT THE JOB.
2.B.4 FLOWEDIT PERMANENT I/0 ERROR ON SYSUT1, PROCESSING TERMINATED
EXPLANATION:  IF THE SYNAD ROUTINE IS ENTERED DURING A BSAM CONTROL
OPERATION OR IF THREE SUCCESSIVE ERROR RECORDS HAVE BEEN READ, THE
ABOVE MESSAGE IS WRITTEN TO THE SYSPRINT DATA SET AND EXECUTION
TERMINATED.
USER RESPONSE:  VERIFY THAT THE INPUT DATA IS VALID AND RESUBMIT THE
JOB.
2.B.5  UNABLE TO FIND NAMES USER EXIT.  FLOWEDIT EXECUTION TERMINATED
EXPLANATION:  FLOWEDIT ISSUED A BLDL MACRO INSTRUCTION TO LOCATE THE
USER EXIT PROGRAM SPECIFIED IN THE PARM FIELD OF THE EXEC CARD, BUT
THE USER EXIT COULD NOT BE FOUND.  ONE OF THE FOLLOWING REASONS CAN
CAUSE THIS TO OCCUR:
1.   THE EXIT PROGRAM HAS NOT BEEN LINK-EDITED INTO A LIBRARY FOR
EXECUTION
2.   THE LINRARY INTO WHICH THE EXIT LOAD MODULE HAS BEEN PLACED IS
NOT THE SYSTEM DATA SET SYS1.  LINKLIB OR NOT DESCRIBED BY A STEPLIB
(OR JOBLIB)DD STATEMENT.
3.   THE NAME GIVEN IN THE USER PARAMETER TO FLOWEDIT IS NOT THE LOAD
MODULE NAME OF THE EXIT PROGRAM.
USER RESPONSE:  CORRECT THE FLOWEDIT JOB CONTROL CARDS AND RESUBMIT
THE JOB.
2.B.6  USER EXIT RETURN CODE INVALID
EXPLANATION:  THE USER EXIT RETURN CODE IS CHECKED TO ENSURE THAT IT
DOES NOT EXCEED THE MAXIMUM VALUE OF 12; THE ABOVE MESSAGE IS ISSUED
WHENEVER THE CODE IS LARGER THAN THIS VALUE.
USER RESPONSE:  CHECK THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE USER EXIT PROGRAM AND
CORRECT THE VALUE OF THE RETURN CODE SET.
E.   ABNORMAL TERMINATION
IF THE USER REPLIES ABE TO THE MANUAL CONTROL MESSAGE (MESSAGE 1.×),
FLOWEDIT ISSUES A USER 1000 ABEND TO PROVIDE A STORAGE DUMP.
