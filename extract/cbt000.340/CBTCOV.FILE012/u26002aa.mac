                              GRIPE
                              =====

1) TSO command GRIPE.
   -----------------

   The TSO command GRIPE is an assembler program which can be entered
   by a TSO user when he or she feels that the response of TSO is slow.
   When the command is entered, the date and time are recorded together
   with the TSO User-id, and they are all formatted into the SMF record
   type 131. The SMF record is written to the SMF dataset and control is
   passed back to the terminal.

        The format of the command is:   GRIPE

        To write a record to the SMF dataset, the program must be in
   protect key 0 and authorised. GRIPE has to be in an authorised
   library like SYS1.LPALIB. The authorisation and protect key are set
   up within GRIPE and reset immediately after the SMF record is
   written. During the time the program is in protect key 0, no
   interrupts are processed.

2) SMF record processing program
   -----------------------------

        The JCL to run the SMF program IFASMFDP has to be altered to
   process SMF 131 records by adding the following:

        - data card after a SYSIN DD * statement, of the form
            OUTDD(ddname,TYPE(131))
        - A DD card which allocates a sequential dataset for SMF type
          131 records.
          //ddname DD DSN=GRIPE131,DISP=(MOD,KEEP)
          The datset has a DCB=(RECFM=VBS,BLKSIZE=4096)

3) GRIPEAN - the analysis program
   ------------------------------

          GRIPEAN is an assembler program which is assembled and link
   edited to a system load library.
          The JCL needed to run the job is as follows:

          //GRIPE1 EXEC PGM=GRIPEAN
          //STEPLIB DD DSN=SYS1.SYSLOAD,DISP=SHR
          //SMF DD DSN=GRIPE131,DISP=SHR
          //LIST DD SYSOUT=A

          The program reads the 131 type SMF records dumped from the
   SMF datasets to the dataset defined by the SMF DD statement. Using
   the data of the first record as the starting date, it compiles a
   histogram for each day showing the GRIPE command usage. The working
   day (08:00 to 17:30 GMT) is divided into 15 minute intervals and the
   GRIPE entries for each time period are accumulated and printed across
   the page. If there are no entries for a given day a message is
   and the histogram is not printed.
          GRIPEAN can analyse a short time period over a given day for
   detailed investigation using a time interval of 1 minute. The
   PARM field on the EXEC card is of the form:
          PARM='yyddd/hhmm-hhmm'
   where,
          yyddd is the year and year-day
          hhmm  is start/end hour and minutes GMT.


4) GRIPECL - the clearing program
   ------------------------------

          GRIPECL is an assembler program which is assembled and link
   edited to a system load library.
          The JCL needed to run the job is as follows:

          //GRIPE2 EXEC PGM=GRIPECL,COND=(0,LT,GRIPE1)
          //STEPLIB DD DSN=SYS1.SYSLOAD,DISP=SHR
          //SMF DD DSN=GRIPE131,DISP=SHR

          The program is run as a second step to GRIPEAN and only if
   it has completed successfully. It reads the GRIPE dataset defined
   by the SMF DD statement, extracting the date and year from the first
   record. It then tries to allocate a dataset to a DD name called
   MONDD. If the dataset does not exist it will dynamically make a new
   one. The records from the GRIPE dataset are then written to the
   monthly dataset, not overwriting any previous records. The GRIPE
   dataset is then cleared by opening it again for output and
   immediately closing it again thus leaving an empty dataset.
