SYSEQCOP-FAST SEQUENTIAL COPY UTILITY            16.2.72
1.    THE SYSEQCOP PROGRAM CAN COPY SEQUENTIAL DATA SETS ON TAPE OR DISK
      THE MODULE IS WRITTEN IN ASSEMBLER AND USES CHAINED SCHEDULING TO
      SPEED UP ALL INPUT-OUTPUT OPERATIONS. SYSEQCOP CAN BE UP TO 50%
      FASTER THAN IEBGENER.
2.    THE PROGRAM WILL PERFORM THE FOLLOWING FUNCTIONS.
           (A) COPY SEQUENTIAL DATA SETS ON DISK OR TAPE
           (B) COPY CONCATENATED FILES TO DISK OR TAPE, WHETHER
               THEY HAVE KILE OR UNLIKE DCB ATTRIBUTES
           (C) UP TO 99,000 RECORDS CAN BE SKIPPED BEFORE STARTING
               TO COPY THE DATA SET
           (D) THE WHOLE DATA SET OR UP TO 99,000 RECORDS (FOR
               TEST FILE PURPOSES) MAY BE COPIED
           (E) THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF DATA SETS THAT CAN BE COPIED
               IN ONE STEP IS 9
           (F) DATA SETS MAY BE REBLOCKED.
3.    THE PROGRAM IS CONTROLLED BY PARM INFORMATION ON THE EXEC JCL CARD
      (SPECF
      (SPECIFIES SCALING FACTORS) AND BY CODING THE DDNAME OF JCL STATEM
      DESCRIBING I
      DESCRIBING THE INPUT AND OUTPUT FILES IN THE MANNER DESCRIBED BELO
      PARM     //S1 EXEC PGM=SYSEQCOP, PARM='XXYY'
           WHERE XX IS THE SCALING FACTOR FOR SKIPPING RECORDS,
                  VALUE O1-99
               YY IS THE SCALING FACTOR FOR WRITING RECORDS, VALUE
                  O1-99
           IF PARM IS NOT CODED, A SCALING FACTOR OF 1 IS ASSUMED
           IF PARM IS CODED, BOTH FIELDS MUST BE ENTERED
      INPUT    //IXAAABBB DD DSN = _____
           WHERE   I INDICATES THAT THIS IS AN INPUT FILE
                   X INDICATES THE FILE NUMBER AND IS EITHER 1-9 OR A-I
                     ALPHA CHARACTERS ARE USED IF DATA SETS WITH UNLIKE
                     DCB ATTRIBUTES ARE CONCATENATED.
               AAA IS THE NUMBER OF RECORDS TO BE SKIPPED, VALUE
                  OOO-999,MULTIPLIED BY THE SCALE FACTOR SPECIFIED
                   IN THE PARM
               BBB IS THE NUMBER OF RECORDS TO BE COPIED, VALUE
                   OOO-999 OR BLANK MULTIPLIED BY THE SCALE FACTOR
                   SPECIFIED IN THE PARM
      NOTE: IF THE WHOLE DATA SET IS TO BE COPIED ONLY I AND X SHOULD
           BE CODED.
      OUTPUT    //0X
          WHERE    0 INDICATES THAT THIS IS AN OUTPUT FILE
                   X INDICATES THE FILE NUMBER AND IS EITHER 1-9 OR A-I.
4.    THE JCL REQUIREMENTS ARE
           //SN EXEC PGM=SYSEQCOP
           //SYSUDUMP DD SYSOUT=(G,,1)
           //IXAAABBB DD (PARAMTERS DEFINED INPUT DATA SET) SEE(B)
           //0X     DD (   "     "  OUTPUT  "  ") " "
      ALL INPUT-OUTPUT JCL STATEMENTS SHOULD BE PAIRED AS THIS PORGRAM W
      COPY THE FIRST INPUT FILE IN THE JOBSTREAM TO THE FIRST OUTPUT FIL
      FOUND IN THE JOBSTREAM ETC..
5.    SYSEQCOP WILL RETURN THE HIGHEST ERROR CODE OBTAINED DURING THE JO
      IN GENERAL REGISTER 15, AND THIS RETURN CODE MAY THEREFORE BE TEST
      BY THE NEXT PROGRAM USING THE COND PARAMETER. SYSEQCOP ALSO WRITES
      THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE
         **SYSEQCOP HIGHEST RETURN CODE IX XX
               WHERE XX IS THE RETURN CODE.
      RETURN CODES ARE
           O SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION
           4 XRBLNK DOES NOT POINT TO TCB
           8 NUMBER OF INPUT FILES GREATER THAN 9
          12  PARM LENGTH NOT 4 BYTES
          16 INPUT-OUTPUT DDNAMES - NOT EQUAL NUMBER
          20 INSUFFICIENT CORE FOR BUFFERS.
6.    THE FOLLOWING EXAMPLES ILLUSTRATE THE USE OF SYSEQCOP
           (I) COPY TAPE FILE TO DISK
               //S1 EXEC PGM=SYSEQCOP
               //I1 DD  (PARAMETERS DEFINING INPUT TAPE)
               //01 DD  (PARAMETERS DEFINING OUTPUT DISK FILE)
           (II) COPY ALL BUT FIRST 1800 RECORDS
               //S1 EXEC PGM=SYSEQCOP, PARM='O2O1'
               //I19OO DD (PARAMETERS DEFINING INPUT FILE)
               //01   DD (PARAMETERS DEFINING OUTPUT FILE)
           (III) COPY TAPE AND DISK FILE TO DISK
               //S1 EXEC PGM=SYSEQCOP
               //IA DD  (PARAMTERS DEFINING INPUT DISK FILE)
               //  DD  (PARAMTERS DEFING INPUT TAPE FILE)
               //0A DD  (PARAMETERS DEFINING OUTPUT DISK FILE)

      ON INPUT
