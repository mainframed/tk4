  A MACRO HAS BEEN ADDED TO WYTHH.HKSORLIB CALLED FCB2.
  THIS SHOULD BE USED WHEN CREATING FORMS CONTROL BLOCKS.
  THE FOLLOWING SYMBOLIC PARAMETERS ARE USED TO AID CONSTRUCTION:-
     &NAME          -   TO ALLOCATE A CSECT NAME, THIS SHOULD BE
                        UP TO 8 CHARACTERS IN LENGTH, STARTING FCB2.
     &DEFAULT       - DO YOU WISH THIS TO BE A DEFAULT IMAGE OR
                        NOT, CODE DEFAULT=8O, IF YOU WANT IT TO BE
                        A DEFAULT IMAGE.
     &LENGTH        - THIS INDICATES THE LENGTH OF THE IMAGE.
                        WHEN USING THE INDEXING FEATURE, ALLOWANCE
                        MUST BE MADE IN THE LENGTH FOR THE INDEX BYTE.
     &INDEX          - THIS ALLOWS FOR THE INDEXING FEATURE.  FOR
                        EXAMPLE INDEX=81 SHIFTS THE PRINTING ONE
                        BYTE TO THE RIGHT.
     &L1 TO &L1OO   - THESE ARE THE LINE INDICATORS AND VALUES.
                        SHOULD BE IN DECIMAL, TO SKIP TO CHANNEL 1
                        ON LINE 1 CODE L1=O1, TO SKIP TO CHANNEL 2
                        LINE 4 CODE L4=O2, TO INDICATE THE END OF
                        THE F.C.B. CODE LN=16 (WHICH IS X'1O' AS PER
                        THE MANUAL), OR IF YOU WISH TO SKIP TO
                        CHANNEL 9 SAY AT THE F.C.B.END CODE LN=25.
  EXAMPLE       F.C.B. FOR REGISTARS TAX AND WARRANTS.
     FCB2WATX FCB2 LENGTH=25,INDEX=86,L1=O1,L8=O2,L24=16
            END
 THIS INDICATES     A)  LENGTH OF 25 BYTES, 24 CARRIAGE POSSITIONS
                        AND 1 INDEX BYTE.
                    B) INDEXING 6 BYTES RIGHT.
                    C) SKIP TO CHANNEL 1 IN LINE 1.
                    D) SKIP TO CHANNEL 2 IN LINE 89
                    E) CUT OFF F.C.B. AT LINE 24.
 THE END STATEMENT MUST BE PRESENT FOR THE ASSEMBLY.
