1.    SYSTPSEP PRINTS THREE PAGES OF A SINGLE ROW OF BLOCK
      CHARACTER OUTPUT. THIS CAN BE USED TO SEPARATE THE OUTPUT
      PRODUCED IN A NUMBER OF STEPS OF A SINGLE JOB.
2.    THE JCL TO EXECUTE SYSTPSEP IS AS FOLLOWS:
           //STEP EXEC PGM=SYSTPSEP, PARM='XXXXXXXX'
           //PRINTSEP DD SYSOUT = (.......), DCB=BLKSIZE=N
             WHERE 'PARM' SPECIFIES THE CHARACTER STRING TO BE
             PRINTED (MAXIMUM =8), AND 'N' IS A MULTIPLE OF 133.
3.1   SYSTPSEP CAN BE CALLED BY ANOTHER PROGRAM. IN THIS CASE THE
      AREA PASSED TO IT SHOULD CONSIST OF A HALFWORD ITEM GIVING
      THE LENGTH OF THE CHARACTER STRING, FOLLOWED BY THE CHARACTER
      STRING ITSELF. THE //PRINTSEP DD CARD MUST BE SUPPLIED IN
      THE EXECUTION JCL.
3.2   IN ANS 'COBOL',FOR EXAMPLE
      DATA DIVISION
           O1 SEPCHARS
               O3 CHARN0 PIC S9999 COMP VALUE +7.
               O3 CHARS PIC X (7) VALUE 'SYOO1 C'.
      PROCEDURE DIVISION.
               CALL 'SYSTPSEP' USING SEPCHARS.
3.3   THE POSITION OF THE SEPARATOR PAGES IN THE OUTPUT STREAM FROM
      THE CALLING PROGRAM IS DEPENDANT ON THE SEQUENCE OF THE SYSOUT
      DD CARDS IN THE EXECUTION JCL.
4.    SYSTPSEP RESIDES ON SYS1.LINKLIB AND IS X '628' BYTES LONG.
