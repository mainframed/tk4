               CALL 'SYCONTRT' USING BYTE-FIELD, BIT-FIELD, LENGTH-FIELD
SYCONTRT/SYEXPAND, BYTE/BIT CONVERSION MODULES   16.5.72
1.    SYCONTRT IS A GENERALISED MODULE WHICH CONTRACTS A VARIABLE NUMBER
      OF CONTIGUOUS SINGLE BYTE SWITCHES INTO THE EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF
      SINGLE BIT SWITCHES.
2.    METHOD OF USE: CALL SYCONTRT PASSING A PARAMETER LIST OF THREE
      ADDRESSES.
           (A) THE ADDRESS OF THE AREA TO BE CONTRACTED
           (B) THE ADDRESS OF THE RESULT FIELD
           (C) ADDRESS OF ALIGNED FULLWORD CONTAINING LENGTH OF
           AREA TO BE CONTRACTED.
3.    RESTRICTIONS: THE INPUT SWITCHES MUST BE SET TO O OR 1,(X'FO',X'F1
      X'CO' OR X'C1'),ANY OTHER VALUE WILL CAUSE A RETURN CODE OF 16 TO
      BE SET, THE NORMAL RETURN CODE IS O.
      THE RESULT FIELD IS ASSUMED TO HAVE A LENGTH EQUAL TO
                   INPUT AREA LENGTH + 7

                             (INGNORE ANY FRACTION)
      THE RESULTING BIT SWITCHES ARE LEFT ALIGNED, UNUSED LITS ARE SET T
      SERO.
4.    EXAMPLE OF USE: (IN COBOL)
           77 BYTE-FIELD PICTURE X(64)
               77 BIT-FIELD PICTURE X(8)
               77 LENGTH-FIELD PICTURE S9(5) COMPUTATIONAL
                                            SYNC VALUE 64
      IF BYTE-FIELD CONTAINS ALTERNATE ZERO AND ONE'S ON ENTRY TO
      SYCONTRT, BIT/FIELD WOULD CONTAIN X'55555555555555' ON RETURN TO T
      CALLING MODULE (I.E. ALTERNATE O'S AND 1'S).
5.    ANOTHER MODULE (SYEXPAND) IS AVAILABLE TO PERFORM THE REVERSE
      FUNCTION (BIT SWITCHES TO BYTE SWITCHES).
6.    METHOD OF USE: CALL SYEXPAND PASSING A PARAMETER LIST OF THREE
      ADDRESSES
           (A) THE ADDRESS OF AREA TO BE EXPANDED
           (B) THE ADDRESS OF THE RESULT FIELD
           (C) ADDRESS OF ALIGNED FULLWORD CONTAINING LENGTH OF RESULT F
7.    RESTRICTIONS: THE INPUT FIELD IS ASSUMED TO HAVE A LENGTH EQUAL TO
               OUTPUT AREA LENGTH + 7

                          (IGNORE ANY FRACTIONS)
               NOTE: THE NUMBER OF BYTES TRANSLATED IS ALWAYS A
                     MULTIPLE OF EIGHT.

               77 BIT-FIELD PICTURE X(8)

               CALL''SYEXPAND' USING BIT-FIELD, BYTE-FIELD, LENGTH-FIELD
      IF THE BIT-FIELD CONTAINS ALTERNATE O'S AND 1'S, THE BYTE-FIELD WO
      CONTAIN X'FOF1F0F1' ETC.
      RETURN CODE FROM SYEXPAND IS ALWAYS ZERO.
