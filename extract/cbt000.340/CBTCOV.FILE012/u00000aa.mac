***      THIS TAPE CONTAINS A SERIES OF PROGRAMS WRITTEN BY THE
***      TECHNICAL SUPPORT GROUP OF THE IBM RESPOND CENTRE AT HAVANT.
*
*        THE PRINCIPAL CHANGES MADE TO UPDATE THE SEVENTH ISSUE TO THE
*        EIGHTH ISSUE ARE....
*              FILE 20 RTPDSCPY.  THIS REPLACES RTPDSCPZ. THIS VERSION
*              FILE 03 SPMODE MACRO CHANGED TO COMPATIBLE WITH REL 20
*                      PRESERVES THE VOLUME LABEL OF SL OUTPUT TAPES.
*                      (SEE FOCUS 34).
*              FILE 21 RTPLKED (=RTP5020M).  ERROR CONNECTED WITH ENTRY
*                      POINTS HAS BEEN CORRECTED. 'DCBS' IS NOW
*                      ALLOWED AS A VALID PARAMETER, AND SSI INFO IS
*                      COPIED FROM THE INPUT DIRECTORY.
*              FILE 22 RTPMLIST.  MINOR CHANGES TO ADD AN ERROR MESSAGE
*                      FOR UNACCEPTABLE INPUT (ONE PARAMETER SPLIT
*                      OVER TWO INPUT CARDS), TO CORRECT THE FULL/EMPTY
*                      BLOCK COUNT FOR THE LISTCAT OPTION, AND TO
*                      PROTECT LIBRARIES ON THE SAME DISK PACK AS SYSIN
*                      FROM ACCIDENTAL DELETION BY IEHPROGM/LIST.
*              FILE 27 RTPPRNT (=RTP5003M).  THIS WILL NOW LIST
*                      SEQUENTIAL DATA SETS.  THE DEFAULT TITLE NOW
*                      SHOWS THE DSNAME AND DISK VOLUME SERIAL OF THE
*                      SOURCE DATA SET.  THE 'MISSING DD CARD' MESSAGE
*                      FOR SYSUT1 HAS BEEN ELIMINATED.
*              FILE 28 RTPRINCA.  ISSUE 7 WAS SUPPOSED TO HAVE A NEW
*                      VERSION THAT DID NOT REQUIRE DSNAME TO BE
*                      'SYSCTLG'.  THIS NEW VERSION IS IN THIS ISSUE.
*              FILE 30 RTPTPREF.  A ZERO FULLWORD HAS BEEN ADDED AFTER
*                      AN EXCP DCB TO PREVENT OPEN IN RTPTPREF FROM
*                      WRITING BACK A JFCB WITH OPTCD=X'87' WHICH
*                      CAUSED THE NEXT OPEN USING THE SAME JFCB (IN THE
*                      LINKED TO PROGRAM) TO FAIL UNDER REL 19.
*              FILE 51 RTP5021M (AMEND DEVICE NAME/MASK TABLES).
*                      NOW AVOIDS A POSSIBLE 0C6 WHEN PARM=CORE.
*        THIS VERSION OF THE EIGHTH ISSUE HAS FILE 3 (RESPOND MACROS)
*        CHANGED TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU TO CONTROL THE DESTINATION
*        LIBRARY, AND TO ENSURE THAT VERSIONS OF MACROS YOU MAY HAVE
*        TAKEN FROM EARLIER ISSUES ARE NOW REPLACED.  THE JCL HAS BEEN
*        REMOVED (FILE 3 WILL NOW BE THE SYSIN FOR AN IEBUPDTE JOB STEP
*        YOU MUST SET UP) AND THE PROPER VERSIONS OF THE MACROS ARE
*        PRECEDED BY ./ REPL CARDS (DUMMY MEMBERS WITH THE SAME NAMES
*        ARE FIRST ADDED TO MAKE THIS WORK IN ALL CASES).
*
         DIFFERENCES IN THE SEVENTH ISSUE WERE.......
         FILE 19 - RTPDMPDS.  CHANGED TO PROCESS A SEQUENTIAL DATA SET
                   CORRECTLY IF THE PARM IS OMITTED.
         FILE 22 - RTPMLIST.  THE LISTCAT OPTION GIVES AN INCORRECT
                   COUNT OF THE NUMBER OF ACTIVE BLOCKS IN THE CATLG.
                   THE DECK HAS NOT BEEN ALTERED BUT YOU CAN CORRECT
                   IT BY CHANGING THE TWO INSTRUCTIONS SHORTLY AFTER
                   THE LABEL 'READB' (IN PUNCHCAT CSECT) FROM....
                             TM   NN,255
                             BO   *+12
                   TO...     CLI  NN,0
                             BNE  *+12
         FILE 28 - RTPRINCA.  THE SAME ERROR EXISTS AS IN RTPMLIST.
         FILE 37 - SAFEDUMP.  MODIFIED TO (A) PROHIBIT COMPRESSION OF
                   ANY 'SYS1.' DATA SETS, AND (B) TO DEQ FROM RTPUPDTE
                   AFTER AN ABEND (TO AVOID A 'D03' COMPLETION UNDER
                   MVT).
         FILE 39 - SUPRSHFL.  THE OBJECT DEDK IS NOT ALTERED BUT IF
                   RUNNING WITH SMF YOU ARE ADVISED TO APPLY THE
                   FOLLOWING ZAP TO PREVENT RELSE CORRUPTING THE SMF
                   TCTIOT (THIS HAPPENS UNDER REL 19 WITH ANY PROGRAM
                   WHEN RELSE FREES AN EXTENT)

                   'JFCB' TO 'VCJFCB' IN THE 'JFCBLIST' EXLST.
         FILE 51 - RTP5021M (AMEND DEVICE NAME TABLE).  NEW VERSION.
                   PREVIOUS VERSION DID NOT CORRECTLY ADJUST COUNT OF
                   DEVICES FOR AN ALTERED UNIT NAME ENTRY.
*
*        THE PRINCIPAL CHANGES MADE TO UPDATE THE FIFTH ISSUE TO THE
*        SIXTH ISSUE WERE....
*              FILE 4  A CORRECTION TO THE PRINCORE MACRO AND MORE
*                      DESCRIPTION FOR OTHER MACROS.
*              FILE 8  IEWLMFT - A CARD HAD BEEN DROPPED FROM THE OLD
*                      VERSION.
*              FILE 22 RTPMLIST - SOME MINOR IMPROVEMENTS
*              FILE 26 RTPMSG2 - CORRECTION FOR USE WITH MCS
*              FILE 27 RTP5003M (RTPPRNT) - AN EXLST PARAMETER WAS
*                      MISSING FROM A DCB BEFORE.
*              FILE 40 SMFDUMP - SOME MAJOR CORRECTIONS TO ERROR
*                      HANDLING ROUTINES.
*              FILE 41 SMFSTATE - CORRECTIONS TO FULL PRINT OF SMF
*                      BUFFER AND NEW FIRST MESSAGE SAYING WHICH FILE
*                      IS CURRENTLY IN USE.
*              FILE 43 SYSSCRAT - NOW INCORPORATES THE VTOCLEAN
*                      ROUTINE TO 'COMPRESS' VTOCS IF REQUIRED.
*              FILE 48 TSGMERGE - IF THE IBM MERGE GIVES A RETURN CODE
*                      THIS IS NOW USED IN PREFERENCE TO ITS OWN.

RESPOND MACROS.  BEFORE ASSEMBLING ANY PROGRAMS FROM THIS TAPE YOU ARE
         ADVISED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LATEST VERSIONS OF THE FOLLOWING
         MACROS ARE AVAILABLE.  THEY ARE RECORDED ON THIS TAPE IN A
         FORM SUITABLE FOR THE SYSIN DATA SET OF AN IEBUPDTE JOB STEP
         BEGIN - EXTENDED 'SAVE' MACRO.
         GOBACK - EXTENDED 'RETURN' MACRO.
         HEXPRINT - CONVERTS ANY STRING OF BYTES TO  EX CHARACTERS
           (WITH OPTIONAL INSERTION OF BLANKS BETWEEN GROUPS)
         PRINCORE - USES HEXPRINT TO FORMAT ANY AREA OF CORE AND SEND
           IT TO A PRINT FILE IN O.S. DUMP FORMAT  SNAP WILL NOT ALLOW
           YOU TO PRINT LIMITED PARTS OF THE NUCLEUS OR CORE BELONGING
           TO ANOTHER TASK.
         TSGSNAP - PROVIDES ALL NORMAL SNAP FACILITIES BUT SAVES YOU
           FROM SETTING UP A DCB AND OPENING IT.  YOU MUST PROVIDE A
           'SNAPOUT' DD CARD.
         FINDUCB - RETURNS A UCB ADDRESS IN RETURN FOR A SPECIFIC UNIT
           ADDRESS
           NAME.  WILL CHECK THAT UCB + 13 HAS NAME +UOTED.
         SPMODE - ALLOWS YOU TO CONTROL THE PROTECT KEY AND MODE (SUPVR
           OR PROBLEM) OF YOUR CURRENT PSW.  REQUIRES SVC 54 WHICH
           WILL BE IN YOUR SYSTEM IF YOU SPECIFIED ISAM AT SYSGEN.
         TSGINNRA,B,C,D - INNER MACROS.
         DATE - EDITS A PACKED FORMAT DATE (YYDDD)TO ANY SPECIFICATION
           GIVEN BY THE FORMAT= KEYWORD AND PLACES THE RESULT IN A
           FIELD SPECIFIED BY THE FIRST POSITIONAL PARAMETER.
           'SEPARATOR' CHARACTERS MAY BE GIVEN IN THE FORMAT= PARM OR
           MAY BESTATED TO BE ALREADY IN THE RESULT FIELD (PREFORM=YES)
           DON'T FORGET TO ENCLOSE THE FORMAT SPECIFICATION IN QUOTES
           E.G.   DATE  CHARDATE,PACKDATE,FORMAT='DD/MM/YY'
         DCBEXITS --SEE FOCUS VOL 22 PAGE 19.  ALLOWS A BLOCKSIZE CODED
           IN THE PROGRAM TO BE OVERRIDDEN BY A DD CARD.
         DLINE - AN AID TO SETTING UP FORMAT V PRINT LINES WITH CONTROL
           CHARACTERS (RECFM=VA/M OR VBA/M)

*MEMBER  U00000CS
DSCBISAM ALLOWS ISAM DATA SETS TO BE CREATED IN WAYS WHICH OVERCOME
         JCL RESTRICTIONS  E.G. DATA AREA CAN BE IN UNEQUAL EXTENTS ON
         DIFFERENT VOLUMES OF SAME FILE, AND SEPARATE INDEX NEED NOT
         TAKE UP A WHOLE CYLINDER.  WORKS BY TAKING A COLLECTION OF
         PRE-ALLOCATED DSCBS (FOR NORMAL SEQ DATA SETS) AND CHANGING
         THEIR FORMAT

*MEMBER  U00000DS
ENQUPDTE EXECUTES IEBUPDTE AND ELIMINATES POSSIBLE CONCURRENT UPDATING
         OF A PDS BY OTHER TASKS IF THEY USE THE SAME FORM OF ENQ.
         SEE TSGBCOPY, RTPUPDTE, IEWLMFT, IEWLMVT.  THIS DISPENSES
         WITH THE NEED FOR DISP=OLD WITH ITS DISADVANTAGES FOR
         OPERATORS.

*MEMBER  U00000ES
FINDVOL  IDENTIFIES DISK VOLUMES (ON OR OFFLINE) AND OPTIONALLY CHANGES
         THE VOL SERIAL.  UNKNOWN VOLS CAN BE IDENTIFIED ON OFFLINE
         DRIVES UNDER O.S.

*MEMBER  U00000FS
IEWLMFT  CHOOSES APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF LINK-EDITOR ACCORDING TO CORE
         AVAILABLE AND ISSUES ENQ TO PREVENT CONCURRENT UPDATING.
         (MFT ONLY VERSION)

*MEMBER  U00000GS
IEWLMVT  MVT VERSION OF IEWLMFT.

*MEMBER  U00000HS
KORAN    MFT ONLY.  GIVES A PRINTED CORE MAP OF YOUR PARTITION AT THE
         TIME OF CALLING.  A USEFUL DEBUGGING TOOL WHICH CAN BE CALLED
         BY ASSEMBLER OR HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGES.

*MEMBER  U00000IS
KORANX   SAME FUNCTION AS KORAN BUT WORKS FROM OUTSIDE THE PARTITION
         BEING MAPPED, AND CAN BE USED TO LOOK AT OPERATIONAL PROGRAMS.

*MEMBER  U00000JS
PREFORM  WILL VERIFY THAT ANY DISK AREA IS FREE OF I/O ERRORS(BY FULL
         TRACK WRITE/READ) AND WILL CLEAR OUT ANY OLD DATA (BY WRITING
         EOF AT START OF EVERY TRACK).  WAS WRITTEN TOCHECK AND EMPTY
         AREAS PRIOR TO USE AS SYS1.MANX AND Y FOR SMF, BUT CAN BE
         APPLIED TO ANY DISK DATA SET.

*MEMBER  U00000KS
PRINFILE SELECTIVELY PRINTS ANY DATA SET (SAM, BDAM, ISAM). DEFAULT
         PRINT IS FIRST 1000 RECORDS IN BOTH HEX AND EBCDIC (AS O.S.
         DUMP) BUT PARM CAN SELECT ANY RECORD LIMITS, OR ALL, WITH
         OPTIONAL 'ALL CHARACTER' PRINT.

*MEMBER  U00000LS
PROTSYS1 PUTS EXPIRY DATE 99365 IN EVERY 'SYS1.' NAME ON THE VOLUME
         POINTED TO BY SYSVTOC DD. SEE RTP5011M.

*MEMBER  U00000MS
PUNCHREP WILL PUNCH AND PRINT CARD IMAGES FOR E=ERY DIRECTORY ENTRY
         OF A PDS.  OUTPUT CAN BE REQUESTED IN EITHER DIRECTORY OR TTR
         SEQUENCE, AND IN FORMAT SUITABLE FOR IEBCOPY, IEHMOVE,
         IEBUPDTE, OR IEHPROGM (SCRATCH).  ALLOWS SELECTIVE MANIULATION
         OF LIBRARY WITHOUT A LOT OF KEYPUNCHING.  ALSO USEFUL JUST TO
         OBTAIN A TTR SEQUENCE LISTING.

*MEMBER  U00000NS
PUNCHSCR WILL PUNCH AND PRINT SCRATCH CARDS FOR ALL (OR JUST TEMPORARY)
         DSNAMES IN UP TO 20 VTOCS.  OUTPUT IS SORTED BY DATE AND TIME
         OF CREATION.

*MEMBER  U00000OS
RTPBLIST PROVIDES A LISTING OF A PDS SHOWING FOR EACH MEMBER....
         NAME,TTR,NO. OF BLOCKS,NO. OF BYTES,MAX BLK LENGTH,MIN BLK LEN
         .... AMONG OTHER USES IS VERY HELPFUL IF SOMEONE HAS CHANGED
         THE BLKSIZE OF A PDS (BY QUOTING A BLKSIZE WHEN OPENING FOR
         OUTPUT) AND YOU HAVE TO SEPARATE MEMBERS OF DIFFERING BLKSIZE.

*MEMBER  U00000PS
RTPDIRD  CREATES A COMPLETE BLDL LIST IN CORE FOR ANY PDS.  OVERCOMES
         THE BLDL REQUIREMENT TO KNOW MEMBER NAMES IN ADVANCE.

*MEMBER  U00000QS
RTPDMPDS PROVIDES AN IEHDASDR PRINT OF A PDS MEMBER OR SAM FILE WITHOUT
         YOUR KNOWING THE BEGIN AND END CCHH LIMITS.

*MEMBER  U00000RS
RTPDSCPY WILL COPY THE WHOLE OF A TAPE, EXCLUDING VOL LABELS, STARTING
         AT THE POINT DEFINED BY DD CARD LABEL PARAMETER AND ENDING AT
         THE FIRST DOUBLE TAPEMARK FOUND.  WILL MAKE UP TO FIVE COPIES
         OF A TAPE  AT THE SAME TIME. (USED FOR MAKING COPIES OF THIS
         MULTI-FILE TAPE)

*MEMBER  U00000SS
RTPLKED  WILL LINK EDIT A WHOLE LIBRARY IN ONE OPERATION.  USEFUL FOR
         COPYING A LOAD MODULE LIBRARY FROM E.G. 2314 TO 2311 AS IT
         WILL RE-BLOCK RECFM U RECORDS WHICH IEHMOVE OR IEBCOPY WILL
         NOT.  WILL MERGE INTO AN EXISTING PDS.

*MEMBER  U00000TS
RTPMLIST IMPROVED COMBINED IEHLIST AND IEHPROGM.  GENERATES TIOT
         ENTRIES FOR ALL DISK VOLUME SERIALS FOUND IN UCBS AT RUN TIME
         THUS SAVING NEED FOR DD CARDS FOR ALL BUT PRIVATE VOLUMES.
         PERMITS USE OF ABBREVIATIONS AND CATALOGUE REFERENCES (E.G.
         LISTPDS DSN=XYZ,VOL=REF=XYZ ). ELIMINATES NEED FOR
         CONTINUATION INDICATORS AND FOR STARTING IN COL 16. ACCEPTS
         INPUT FROM SYSIN OR FROM CONSOLE (PARM=CONSOLE).  PROTECTS
         AGAINST IEHLIST/IEHPROGM DELETING YOUR DATA SETS ACCIDENTALLY.
         ALSO INCLUDES RTPRINCA FACILITES (E.G. LISTCAT VOL=REF=SYS )

*MEMBER  U00000US
RTPMOUNT IN SITUATIONS WHERE A DISK VOLUME CANNOT BE PERMANENTLY
         MOUNTED AND 'VOL=(,RETAIN)' DOES NOT ALWAYS PREVENT O.S.
         FROM DISMOUNTING THE PACK BETWEEN STEPS THIS PROGRAM WILL
         FORCE THE MOUNT BIT ON IN THE UCB(S) FOR ALL DISK VOLUMES
         QUOTED IN JCL AFTER O.S. HAS SUCCESSFULLY ALLOCATED THEM.
         THE OPERATOR IS INFORMED, AND THE RTPUNLD PROGRAM SHOULD BE
         USED TO PUT ON THE UNLOAD BIT IN THE UCB(S) WHEN THE VOLUMES
         ARE FINISHED WITH.

*MEMBER  U00000VS
RTPUNLD  SEE RTPMOUNT.

*MEMBER  U00000WS
RTPMOVE  MAKES IEHMOVE EASIER TO USE BECAUSE YOU NEED NOT KNOW THE VOL
         SERIALS ON WHICH YOUR DATA SETS RESIDE.  INSTEAD YOU DEFINE
         ALL DATA SETS INVOLVED BY DDCARDS WITH DDNAMES THAT IDENTIFY
         THE TYPE OF OPERATION (CHARS 1,2 = CP = COPY PDS), 'TO' OR
         'FROM' (CHAR 3 = F = FROM), AND GIVE ANY IDENTIFIER TO
         ASSOCIATE DDNAMES FOR EACH OPERATION (N.B. 'ALL' IS A SPECIAL
         IDENTIFIER TO ASSOCIATE WITH ALL DDNAMES HAVING SAME OPERATION
         AND OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF MOVE/COPY).

*MEMBER  U00000XS
RTPMSG2  PROVIDES A MEANS OF COMMUNICATING WITH THE OPERATOR FROM
         WITHIN YOUR JOB, AND ISSUING CONSOLE MESSAGES, COMMANDS, OR
         INTRODUCING A DELAY BY REQUESTING AN OPERATOR REPLY TO A WTOR.
         PARM OR SYSIN DATA BECOME WTO'S, COMMANDS, OR WTOR'S WHEN THE
         STEP IS EXECUTED. PROVIDES HARDCOPY ON SYSPRINT.
         EXAMPLES OF USE....
           1. WTO TO OPERATOR 'PLEASE RING EXT 1234 IMMEDIATELY IF THIS
              JOB FAILS'
           2. COMMAND (EXECUTED AS LAST STEP OF JOB - INDICATING THAT
              PREVIOUS STEPS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL) 'RELEASE JOBXYZ'
              (JOBXYZ ASSUMED TO BE IN HOLD Q)

*MEMBER  U00000YS
RTP5003M  (=RTPPRNT)         WILL SAVE A LOT OF PAPER WHEN PRINTING THE
         WHOLE OF A LARGE PDS (E.G. PROCLIB) BY PLACING MORE THAN ONE
         MEMBER ON ONE PAGE.  WILL ALSO PRODUCE AS MANY COPIES (ONE
         AFTER THE OTHER) AS YOU SPECIFY IN PARM='C=N'.  BY DEFAULT
         PRINTS THE WHOLE PDS BUT YOU CAN GIVE MEMBER NAMES (AND A '
         'TITLE') IN SYSIN.  SEE FOCUS VOL 28 FOR DETAILS.
         EXAMPLE: TO PRINT SELECTED MEMBERS OF X.SORSLIB WITH TITLE, 3
         COPIES, AND WITH EACH MEMBER STARTING ON A NEW PAGE....
         //PRINT  EXEC  PGM=RTPPRNT,PARM='P,C=3'
         //SYSPRINT  DD  SYSOUT=A
         //SYSLIB  DD  DSN=X.SORSLIB,DISP=SHR
         //SYSUT1  DD  UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(CYL,(2,1))
         //SYSIN  DD  *
           TITLE  ITEM='LIST OF X.SORSLIB ON 7 JAN 71'
           MEMBER  NAME=(MEMBA,MEMBB,....MEMBN)
         /*

*MEMBER  U00000ZS
RTPRINCA PROVIDES AN IMPROVED LISTING OF SYSCTLG.  IN ADDITION TO THE
         7 ADVANTAGES OVER IEHLIST SHOWN IN ASSEMLY LISTING COMMENTS
         WE HAVE FOUND IT ALWAYS WORKS WHEN IEHLIST (REL 18) GIVES UP
         WITH 'ILLEGAL NODE POINT' MESSAGE.

*MEMBER  U000000S
RTPQINIT ALLOWS YOU TO FORMAT A 'SECONDARY' JOBQ AS A NORMAL O.S. JOB.
         THIS SAVES STAND ALONE TIME WHEN YOU FIND YOU HAVE TO FORMAT
         AT IPL TIME.  INSTEAD YOU SPECIFY IN THE 'SET' COMMAND THE
         ADDRESS OF THE JOBQ THAT IS ALREADY FORMATTED AND RE-FORMAT
         THE FAILING JOBQ LATER (THIS ALSO GIVES YOU A CHANCE TO
         INVESTIGATE THE FAILING JOBQ).
         THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN REVISED TO ALLOW FOR THE FOURTH 'WTP'
         JOBQ PARAMETER REQUIRED BY REL 19, AND HAS BEEN CHANGED SO
         THAT A PARM OF 'U' (OR NO PARM) RESULTS IN USE OF THE PARMS
         SET UP IN MASTER RESIDENT CORE AT LAST IPL (I.E. SYSGEN
         DEFAULTS OR THOSE GIVEN BY OPERATOR FOR NORMAL Q FORMAT)

*MEMBER  U000001S
RTPTPREF OVERCOMES AN O.S. DEFICIENCY AND ALLOWS A MULTI-VOLUME TAPE
         OUTPUT DATA SET TO BE WRITTEN ON A SET OF VOLUMES OBTAINED BY
         CATALOGUE REFERENCE.  O.S. ONLY GIVES ONE VOL SERIAL (THE LAST
         IN RESPONSE TO 'VOL=REF= ', AND IF 'DSN=REFNAME ' IS CODED FOR
         OUTPUT OF A NEW GDG MEMBER THE WRONG DSNAME IS WRITTEN INTO
         THE LABEL.  RTPTPREF OBTAINS THE CORRECT VOL SERIALS, PUTS
         THEM IN THE OUTPUT JFCB, LINKS TO THE USER PROGRAM THAT
         REQUIRES THEM, AND WILL ABEND (TO PREVENT CATALOGUING THE
         OUTPUT TAPES IN PRE-REL 19 SYSTEMS) IF THE USERS RETURN CODE
         IS HIGHER THAN A SPECIFIED VALUE.  THIS VERSION OPENS AND
         CLOSES THE OUTPUT TAPES TO WRITE THE NEW DSNAME IN THE LABELS
         (SEE FOCUS VOL 19 PAGE 20)

*MEMBER  U000002S
RTPTPRF2 AS RTPTPREF BUT WITHOUT OPENING AND CLOSING THE TAPES.

*MEMBER  U000003S
RTPUNCAL IF THE CATALOGUE ENTRIES FOR A LARGE GDG HAVE BECOME CORRUPT
         THIS PROGRAM AIDS CORRECTION BY AUTOMATICALLY UNCATALOGUING
         EVERY GENERATION AND PUNCHING AN EQUIVALENT 'CATLG' CARD (DSN
         AND VOL SERIALS ARE ON SEPARATE CARDS TO HELP SHUFFLING).
         N.B. IF THE GDG HAS DISK MEMBERS 'SCRUNTAL' CAN BE USED IN
         PLACE OF 'UNCATALL' TO CAUSE SCRATCH AS WELL AS UNCATLG.

*MEMBER  U000004S
RTPUPDTE OVERCOMES THE RESTRICTION OF IEBUPDTE WHICH LIMITS YOU TO ONE
         'UPDATE INPLACE' PER JOBSTEP.  THIS PROGRAM ENQS TO PREVENT
         CONCURRENT UPDATING BY OTHER JOBS (SEE ENQUPDTE) AND CALLS
         IEBUPDTE SEPARATELY FOR EACH UPDATE INPLACE.

*MEMBER  U000005S
RTPXDSCB ALLOWS YOU TO UPDATE THE FOLLOWING FIELDS IN AN EXISTING DSCB
         BY QUOTING THE APPROPRIATE PARAMETER IN ANY JCL REFERRING TO
         THE DATA SETS INVOLVED....
         RECFM,EXPDT,BLKSIZE,LRECL,DSORG,OPTCD, OR SPACE (TYPE OF
         REQUEST OR SEC. ALLOCATION QTY).
         N.B TO ZERO THESE FIELDS YOU MUST USE SUPERZAP.

RTP5010M SIMILAR TO PUNCHREP BUT WITH SPECIAL APPLICATION TO REMOVING
         GROUPS OF MEMBERS HAVING NAMES WITH A COMMON PREFIX.  PRODUCES
         AN IEHMOVE 'SELECT' CARD AND AN IEHPROGM 'SCRATCH' CARD FOR
         EACH NAME BEGINNING WITH AN IDENTIFIER GIVEN IN THE PARM.
         E.G. PARM='IEM' AND 'SYSLIB DD DSN=SYS1.LINKLIB,DISP=SHR' WILL
         GIVE OUTPUT TO MOVE ALL PL1 MODULES FROM LINKLIB AND THEN
         SCRATCH THEM.

RTP5011M IN RESPONSE TO A PARM IN THE FORM 'NODE,YYDDD' IT CHANGES THE
         EXPIRY DATE TO YYDDD IN EVERY DSCB HAVING A DSNAME BEGINNING
         WITH THE CHARACTER STRING ENTERED AS 'NODE' ON ALL VOLUMES
         SPECIFIED BY JCL.  E.G PARM='SYS1.,99365'
         A FURTHER PARAMETER ',N' OR ',F' FOLLOWING YYDDD CAN BE USED
         TO SET THE PASSWORD PROTECT BIT ON (N) OR OFF (F).  IN THIS
         CASE YOU CAN PUT 'FFFFF' FOR YYDDD IF YOU DO NOT WANT TO
         CHANGE THE EXPIRY DATE.  E.G. PARM='A.B.C.XYZ,FFFFF,F'

SAFEDUMP DUMPS A DISK VOLUME TO TAPE (MUST BE A GDG MEMBER) AND THEN
         SEARCHES THE VTOC FOR ANY PDS'S WITH MORE THAN X PERCENT OF
         THEIR ALLOCATED SPACE IN USE.  EACH PDS SO FOUND IS COMPRESSED
         BY SUPRSHFL.  IN EVENT OF FAILURE A STAE ROUTINE RESTORES THE
         DISK FROM TAPE.
         THIS PROGRAM COULD BE EXTENDED BY HAVING A LIST OF PDS'S TO
         BE INCLUDED/EXCLUDED FROM TEST FOR COMPRESSION.

LOADSHUF USED WITH SAFEDUMP IN MVT TO OVERCOME SUPRSHFL'S FAILURE TO
         RELEASE ALL ITS ACQUIRED CORE.  LOADSHUF PATCHES SUPRSHFL TO
         FORCE ALL GETMAINS TO BE FROM SUBPOOL 1, THEN ISSUES FREEMAIN
         FOR ALL SUBPOOL 1 ON RETURN FROM SUPRSHFL.  (SAFEDUMP
         PERFORMS A SIMILAR FUNCTION FOR MFT BY SAVING AND RESTORING
         THE FQE CHAIN).

SUPRSHFL THIS IS AN OBJECT MODULE OF THE VERY FAST COMPRESS INPLACE
         PROGRAM WRITTEN BY NICK TINDALL OF UK GOVNT SYSTEMS CENTRE.
         WE FIND IT FASTER THAN REL 19 IEBCOPY FOR 'IN-PLACE' OPERATION
         AND IT ALSO RELEASES DISK EXTENTS.

SMFDUMP  DUMPS SMF RECORDS FROM DISK TO TAPE WITH FULL DATA PROTECTION.
         THIS PROGRAM IS ALWAYS USED AT RESPOND IN PREFERENCE TO THE
         STANDARD IBM DUMP UTILITY.  THIS VERSION IS A REVISION OF THE
         ORIGINAL ISSUE WHICH PREVENTS A LOOP WHEN SMF IS IN A 'LOST
         DATA' STATE AND ALSO HAS ROUTCDES AND DESCRIPTOR CODES FOR
         ITS WTOS.
*                FEATURES INCLUDE..........
*                * AUTOMATICALLY FINDS DATA SET NOT IN USE AND ONLY
*                  DUMPS IT IF NOT EMPTY (CANNOT AFFECT CURRENT DATA )
*                * MAINTAINS TAPE DATA AS GEN DATA GROUP BY COPYING
*                  GEN (0) TO (+1).  DOES NOT USE MOD.
*                * READS BACK (+1) TO CHECK WRITING.
*                * RECORDS COPY OF DISK DATA AS FILE 2 ON GEN (0) TAPE.
*                * PRINTS LOG OF EACH RUN SPECIFYING NO OF RECORDS AND
*                  TIME OF EACH 'IPL GROUP' DUMPED.
*                * ENSURES SMF HAS NOT SWITCHED FILES DURING RUN.
*                * IF ALL TESTS ARE GOOD DELETES ALL DISK DATA TO
*                  PREVENT DUPLICATION. WRITES EOF IN EVERY TRACK.
*                * DOES NOT LET O.S. JCL CATLG THE (+1) TAPE. DOES SO
*                  BY MACRO ONLY IF DUMP WAS GOOD.
*                * HAS INBUILT ERROR RECOVERY FOR ALL DISK AND TAPE
*                  ERRORS.  E.G. FOR DISK I/O ERROR RENAMES BAD DATA
*                  SET AND REPLACES IT BY SPARE (SYS1.MANZ) PENDING
*                  ERROR CORRECTION, THEN ALLOWS CORRECTED DATA TO BE
*                  DUMPED FROM MANA BY USE OF PARM ON EXEC.

SMFSTATE TELLS THE OPERATOR BY WTO WHICH SMF DISK DATA SET IS CURRENTLY
         IN USE AND HOW FULL EACH OF THE TWO DATA SETS IS ('X TRKS USED
         OUT OF Y TRKS').  ROUTCDE=(2,11) GIVES THIS INFORMATION ON
         LISTING AS WELL AS CONSOLE WITH REL 19.  IF PARM=ALL IS GIVEN
         YOU ALSO GET A PRINT (USING CORPRINT MACRO) OF SMCA,DCBS,DEB,
         AND SMF BUFFER ON SYSPRINT.

*MEMBER  U00001DS
SWITSMF  THIS MODULE (IGC0Z03D) PROCESSES A NEW COMMAND 'SWITSMF' TO
         ALLOW THE OPERATOR TO SWITCH SMF DISK DATA SETS ON DEMAND
         WITHOUT THE DISADVANTAGE OF Z EOD (WHICH CLOSES THE LOG AT THE
         SAME TIME). HAS CHECKS TO ENSURE THE SWITCH WILL WORK BEFORE
         IT EXECUTES IT (E.G. ALTERNATE MUST BE EMPTY).
         N.B. NECESSARY ZAP FOR REL 19.1 IGC0403D IS INCLUDED.

*MEMBER  U00001ES
SYSSCRAT SCRATCHES 'LEFT OVER' TEMPORARY DSNAMES FROM DISKS.  BY
         DEFAULT IT SEARCHES ALL DISK VOLUMES CURRENTLY ON THE SYSTEM
         AND SCRATCHES ALL DSNAMES MORE THAN 12 HOURS OLD.  THE
         OPERATOR MAY VARY THE 'DEADLINE TIME' (E.G. TO THE TIME OF A
         RECENT COLD START) AND THE PARM CAN BE USED TO RESTRICT THE
         SEARCH TO CERTAIN UNIT ADDRESSES (E.G. WORK PACKS ONLY).  PARM
         MAY ALSO SPECIFY 'NO OPERATOR COMMUNICATION (12 HOURS ASSUMED)
         OR NO SCRATCHING (A LIST OF DSNAMES ELIGIBLE FOR SCRATCHING IS
         PRINTED).
         THE 'TSGVHEC' MODIFICATION TO THE READER SHOULD BE MADE BEFORE
         THIS PROGRAM IS USED TO ENSURE THAT DATA SETS ARE GIVEN THE
         TIME OF READING, NOT THE TIME OF RDR START.
         IF WHEN READING THROUGH THE VTOC MORE THAN 25 FORMAT 0 DSCBS
         ARE ENCOUNTERED BEFORE THE 'HIGH WATER MARK' (ADDRESS OF LAST
         ACTIVE FORMAT 1 DSCB) IS REACHED THE VTOCLEAN ROUTINE IS
         AUTOMATICALLY ENTERED.  THIS WILL MOVE THE FORMAT 1 DSCBS WITH
         THE HIGHEST ADDRESSES BACK TO FILL THE FORMAT 0 DSCBS WITH
         THE LOWEST ADDRESSES AND WILL ADJUST THE 'HIGH WATER MARK' IN
         THE FORMAT 4 DSCB.  SINCE O.S. LEAVES THE 'HIGH WATER MARK' AT
         THE HIGHEST ADDRESS EVER USED (I.E. IT IS NEVER MOVED BACK)
         THIS CAN SAVE A LOT OF TIME IN THE 'DUPLICATE NAME SEARCH'
         WHICH OCCURS FOR EACH NEW DATA SET IN ALLOCATION, AND MAY SAVE
         A SMALL AMOUNT OF TIME IN FINDING OLD DATA SETS DSCBS.

TSGLSORT A MONITOR FOR SORT.  PROVIDES MORE RETURN CODES THAN STANDARD
         REL 18 SORT TO INDICATE SUCCESS OR FAILURE (E.G. WILL SHOW IF
         SORTIN HAS NO RECORDS).  ALSO GENERATES AN AUTOMATIC CORESIZE
         PARAMETER ACCORDING TO CORE AVAILABLE.

TSGVHEC  A CSECT TO BE COMPILED AND LINK-EDITED INTO THE RDR (IEFVHA)
         TO ENSURE THAT EACH SYSTEM GENERATED DSNAME HAS THE TIME OF
         READING, NOT THE TIME OF RDR START (WHICH COULD BE MANY HOURS
         BACK).  REQUIRED FOR SAFE USE OF SYSSCRAT, AND CAN AVOID
         UNNECESSARY DUPLICATE NAME ERRORS FOR TEMP DATA SETS AFTER
         A JOB HAS ONCE FAILED AND IS RE-RUN.

*MEMBER  U00001MS
RTP5021M - THIS PROGRAM WILL AMEND THE SYSTEM DEVICE NAME AND MASK
         TABLES IN REL 19 OR LATER SYSTEMS.  IT CANNOT ADD NAMES TO
         THE TABLES BUT WILL AMEND EXISTING NAMES OR WILL CHANGE THE
         LIST OF UNITS TO WHICH AN EXISTING NAME APPLIES.  IT WILL
         OPTIONALLY AMEND THE TABLES IN CORE ONLY, OR ON DISK, OR BOTH
         OR WILL JUST GIVE YOU A PRINT OF THE CURRENT CONTENTS (YOU GET
         THIS WITH ALL OPTIONS).

RTPREXPT  PROVIDES A MEANS OF LISTING ANY MULTIFILE TAPE OF 80 BYTE
          RECORDS. THESE FILES MAY HAVE BLKSIZE FROM 80-3200, BUT IT
          COULD EASILY BE MODIFIED FOR LONGER.
          IF PARM  IS OMITTED FROM THE EXEC CARD THE WHOLE TAPE IS
          LISTED STOPPING ONLY AT A DOUBLE TAPE MARK
          IF PARM SPECIFIED AS PARM=N, ONLY THE FIRST N BLOCKS OF EACH
          FILE ARE PRINTED.
