    THIS PROGRAM PRODUCES A GRAPH OR GRAPHS ON A PRINTER.
    THE INPUT DATA IS IN 80 BYTE RECORDS IN ONE OF TWO
  FORMATS - EITHER PRE-CALCULATED SHORT FLOATING POINT OR
  EBCDIC.

    THE AXES ARE SELF-POSITIONING AND SELF-SCALING.
    MORE THAN ONE SET OF DATA MAY BE PLOTTED ON ONE GRAPH
  HOWEVER AS THE SCALES ARE TAKEN FROM THE FIRST SET OF
  DATA THE HIGHEST AND LOWEST POINTS SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN
  THE FIRST SET SO THAT NO POINTS ARE LOST.

    THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF POINTS THAT CAN BE PLOTTED ON ONE
  GRAPH IS 200. TO PLOT MORE THAN THIS YOU MUST PLOT MORE THAN
  ONE GRAPH ON THE SAME AXES WITH THE CAUTION NOTED ABOVE.

    THE TWO TYPES OF DATA ARE OF THE SAME GENERAL FORMAT -


   4 HEADING RECORDS
     DATA RECORDS
   8 SUBTITLE RECORDS    (OPTIONAL)


    THE HEADING RECORDS ARE AS FOLLOWS -

 1.   CC1 = 1 OR BLANK - CHAR. 1 MEANS THE DATA ARE IN FLOATING POINT NO
                       - BLANK MEANS THE DATA ARE IN EBCDIC
      CC7-66   LEFT HALF OF TITLE.

 2.   CC7-66   RIGHT HALF OF TITLE.

 3.   CC7-34   TITLE FOR X AXIS
      CC40-67  TITLE FOR Y AXIS.

 4. IF CARD 1 COLUMN 1 = 1 THEN -
    A CC1-4    FULLWORD BINARY 1 IF FIRST SET OF DATA FOR THIS GRAPH
                               0 FOR SUBSEQUENT DATA FOR SAME GRAPH
    B CC5-8    FULLWORD BINARY NUMBER OF POINTS TO BE PLOTTED
    C CC9-12   FULLWORD BINARY 0 FOR LINEAR SCALE ON X AXIS
                               1 FOR LOG SCALE ON X AXIS
    D CC13-16  FULLWORD BINARY 0 FOR LINEAR SCALE ON Y AXIS
                               1 FOR LOG SCALE ON Y AXIS
    E CC17-20  FULLWORD BINARY 0 - MORE DATA FOR THIS GRAPH (REPEAT FROM
                               1 - LAST DATA FOR THIS GRAPH BUT MORE GRA
                               2 - SUBTITLE RECORDS EXIST
                               9 - LAST OF ALL DATA FOR ALL GRAPHS
    F CC21-24  THREE BLANKS FOLLOWED BY EBCDIC CHAR TO BE USED FOR PLOTT
    G CC25     BLANK = POINT PLOTTING
               V = VERTICAL HISTOGRAM - POINTS EXTENDED TO X AXIS
               H = HORIZONTAL HISTOGRAM - POINTS EXTENDED TO Y AXIS.

    IF CARD 1 COLUMN 1 = BLANK THEN -
      CC1      1 OR BLANK AS 'A' ABOVE
      CC7-9    NUMBER OF POINTS TO BE PLOTTED
      CC20-21  00 = LINEAR SCALE ON X AXIS
               01 = LOG SCALE ON X AXIS
      CC24-25  00 = LINEAR SCALE ON Y AXIS
               01 = LOG SCALE ON Y AXIS
      CC40     EBCDIC NUMBER AS FOR 'E' ABOVE
      CC50     CHARACTER TO BE USED FOR PLOTTING
      CC51     AS FOR 'G' ABOVE


    THE DATA RECORDS ARE AS FOLLOWS -

    IF CARD 1 COLUMN 1 = 1 THEN -
         EACH 80 BYTE RECORD CONTAINS 20 X,Y PAIRS OF POINTS IN SHORT
        FLOATING POINT FORMAT WITH NO SEPARATING CHARACTERS.

    IF CARD 1 COLUMN 1 = BLANK THEN -
         EACH CARD CONTAINS 3 X,Y PAIRS OF DATA LEFT JUSTIFIED STARTING
        IN COLUMN 7. THE DATA CONFORMS TO THE FORTRAN FORMAT -
        E9.2,2X,E9.2,2X  ETC.


    THE SUBTITLE RECORDS IF PRESENT ARE AS FOLLOWS -
         THERE CAN BE A MAXIMUM OF 4 SUBTITLE LINES WHICH ARE INPUT
        AS 8 RECORDS (2 PER LINE).
         THE FIRST CHARACTER OF THE ODD CARDS IS AN ANSI CONTROL CHAR.
        THE NEXT 79 CHARACTERS FORM THE LEFT HAND PART OF THE LINE.
         THE FIRST 53 CHARACTERS OF THE EVEN CARDS FORM THE RIGHT
        HAND PART OF THE LINE.
         NO EDITING OR CONVERSION IS DONE.


  J.C.L. REQUIRED -

  //  EXEC PGM=GPLOT
  //FT03F001 DD SYSOUT=A
  //FT01F001 DD         PARAMETERS FOR INPUT FILE


    SAMPLE DATA TO PLOT TWO STRAIGHT LINE GRAPHS IS GIVEN
  IN MEMBER U55012BA.
