10.1. INTRODUCTION
THIS PROGRAM WILL SELECT AND THEN EDIT SPECIFIED RECORDS FROM A
SEQUENTIAL FILE. AS AN OPTIONAL FEATURE, THE OS VERSION WILL
ALSO COPY THE SELECTED RECORDS TO ANOTHER FILE. THE OS VERSION
WILL ALSO PROCESS AN INDEXED SEQUENTIAL FILE IN KEY-SEQUENCIAL
MODE.
10.2. INPUT DATA
10.2.1. OS VERSION
INPUT MAY BE ANY SEQUENTIAL FILE OR INDEXED SEQUENTIAL FILE.
ANY BLOCKING FORMAT MAY BE USED, SUBJECT TO THE PARAMETERS
SUBMITTED. THE FILE IS DEFINED BY AN INPF DD CARD.
PARAMETERS ARE SUBMITTED TO THE PROGRAM AS A DATASET DEFINED
BY A SYSIN DD CARD. A MAXIMUM OF 23 INPUT PARAMETERS ARE
ALLOWED WHEN INPUT IN THIS WAY. PARAMETERS MAY ALSO BE
ENTERED FROM THE OPERATORS CONSOLE.
10.2.2. SYSTEM 4 VERSION

BE ANY CHARACTER OR SPACES.
 PARAMETERS ARE SUBMITTED TO THE PROGRAM FOLLOWING A // PARAM
CARD IN THE JOB DESCRIPTION. PARAMETERS MAY ALSO BE ENTERED
FROM THE OPERATORS CONSOLE.
10.3. OUTPUT DATA
10.3.1 OS VERSION
EDITED OUTPUT IS EITHER TO A PRINTER OR SYSOUT DATASET, OR
TP A MAGNETIC TAPE IN STANDARD FORMAT FOR OFF-LINE PRINTING.
THE DDNAME IS PRINT. IF NO EDITED OUTPUT IS DESIRED A
DUMMY CARD SHOULD BE USED. COPIED SELECTED RECORDS ARE
WRITTEN TO A DATASET DEFINED BY AN OUTF DD CARD. THIS DD
CARD MAY BE OMITTED IF NO COPYING IS TO BE PREFORMED. THIS
DATASET MAY ONLY BE A SEQUENTIAL DATASET.
10.3.2. SYSTEM 4 VERSION

STANDARD FORMAT FOR OFF-LINE PRINTING. THE SYMBOLIC
 FILENAME FOR THE OUTPUT IS PRINT
10.4. NORMAL OPERATION
10.4.1. OS VERSION
THE FOLLOWING JCL SHOULD BE USED.
EXEC STATEMENT - SPECIFIES THE PROGRAM NAME.  ANY PARM
INFORMATION WILL BE PRINTED IN THE HEADING OF THE EDITED
OUTPUT.
STEPLIB DD STANTEMENT - DEFINES THE DATASET CONTAINING THE
PROGRAM(NOT NORMALLY REQUIRED).
INPF DD STATEMENT - DEFINES THE DATASET TO NE EDITED AND/OR
COPIED.  DCB INFORMATION IS REQUIRED IF STANDARD LABELS ARE
NOT SPECIFIED (BLKSIZE,LRECL,RECFM).
PRINT DD STATEMENT - DEFINES THE OUTPUT DATASET TO CONTAIN
THE EDITED OUTPUT. DCB INFORMATION TO GIVE THE BLKSIZE MAY
BE GIVEN BUT IF NOT A DEFAULT OF 1330 WILL BE USED.  IF A
MAGNETIC DATASET IS SPECIFIED, THE EDIT WILL BE OUTPUT
IN STANDARD OFF-LINE FORMAT. DUMMY SHOULD BE SPECIFIED IF
NO EDIT IS REQUIRED.
OUTF DD STATEMENT - DEFINES THE OUTPUT DATASET TO CONTAIN THE
SELECTED RECORDS. IF THE DATASET IS NOT AN AXISTING DATASET
WITH STANDARD LEBELS, ALL DCB INFORMATION SHOULD BE GIVEN
(BLKSIZE,LRECL,RECFM).  THIS STATEMENT SHOULD NOT BE USED
IF AN OUTPUT DATASET IS NOT REQUIRED.
SYSIN DD STATEMENT - DEFINES THE DATASET CONTAINING THE
CONTROL PARAMETERS. IF NO PARAMETERS ARE TO BE INPUT A
DUMMY STATEMENT MUST BE USED.
IF A VOLUME SERIAL NUMBER OF RAA999 IS USED WITH THE INPF OR
PRINT DD STATEMENT IN CONJUNCTION WITH UNIT=(2400,,DEFER),

10.5. PARAMETER STATEMENTS
10.5.1. PARAMETER STATEMENTS ARE USED TO DEFINE THE SPECIFIC
EDITING OPERATION REQUIEED. IT IS THE USER'S RESPONS-
IBILITY TO PROVIDE STATEMENTS THAT DEFINE ACCURATELY:
A) THE FILE TO BE EDITED,
B) THE MODE OF SELECTION,
C) THE PARAMETERS FOR SELECTION.
10.5.2. THE STATEMENTS USED ARE:
FILE STATEMENT - USED TO SPECIFY THE FOEMAT OF THE FILE
TO BE EDITED.
CONTROL STATAMENT - USED TO SPECIFY THE METHOD OF SELECTION
OF RECORDS TO BE EDITED.
RECORD STATEMENT - USED TO SPECIFY THE RANGE OF RECORDS TO
BE EDITED.
END STATEMENT - USED TO SIGNIFY THE END OF THE PARAMETER
STATEMENTS.
10.5.3. EACH PARAMETER STATEMENT CARD MUST NOT CONTAIN MORE THAN A
SINGLE STATEMENT, AND EACH MUST BE CONTAINED WHOLLY ON ONE
CARD USING COLUMNS 1-71 INCLUSIVE.
PARAMETER STATEMENTS CONSIST OF A STATEMENT DEFINER AND
PARAMETER ENTRIES.
10.5.4. RULES FOR THE PUNCHING OF PARAMETER STATEMENTS
A) THE FIRST ENTRY IN A PARAMETER STATEMENT CARD MUST BE
A STATEMENT DEFINER. THIS DEFINER MAY BE PROCEDED BY
ONE OR MORE SPACES AND MUST BE FOLLOWED BY AT LEAST ONE
SPACE.
B) PARAMETER ENTRIES MAY APPEAR IN ANY ORDER SEPARATED BY
COMMAS; EACH CAN BE FOLLOWED BY ONE OR MORE ASSOCIATED
VALUES. THE LAST PARAMETER ENTRY IS FOLLOWED BY A SPACE.
C) COMMAS, EQUAL SIGNS, RIGHT AND LEFT PARENTHESES
AND SPACES ARE USED AS DELIMITERS, AND MAY NOT BE
USED WITHIN VALUES (WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS - SEE
BELOW).
D) ONLY ONE FILE AND CONTROL STATEMENT MAY BE SUBMITTED,
AS MANY RECORD STATEMENTS AS REQUIRED MAY BE USED.
10.5.5. PARAMETER STATEMENTS - DETAIL
10.5.5.1. FILE STATEMENT
STATEMENT DEFINER: FILE
PARAMETER ENTRIES:
A) TYPE=U
A) TYPE=F
A) TYPE=V
U SUGNIFIES AN UNDEFINES FILE, EACH RECORD EDITED
WILL BE ONE BLOCK.
F SIGNIFIES THAT THE FILE CONTAINS FIXED LENGTH
RECORDS.
V SIGNIFIES THAT THE FILE CONTAINS VARIABLE LENGTH
RECORDS WITH THE LENGTH IN THE FIRST TWO BYTES.
IF THIS PARAMETER ENTRY IS OMITTED, TYPE = U
IS ASSUMED.
B) LENGTH=N
THIS ENTRY IS REQUIRED TO DEFINE THE LENGTH
OF THE FIXED LENGTH RECORDS IF TYPE = F IS
USED. N IS A DECIMAL NUMBER OF ONE TO FOUR
DIGITS.
10.5.5.2. CONTROL STATEMENTS
STATEMENT DEFINER: CONTROL
PARAMETER ENTRIES:
A) FIELD=(D,1,X
A) FIELD=(D,1,C
A) FIELD=(D,1,P
THIS ENTRY DEFINES THE PART OF EACH RECORD THAT
IS TO BE CONTROL FIELD. D IS THE DIS-
PLACEMENT OF THE FIRST BYTE (1-4 DECIMAL DIGITS),
1 IS THE LENGTH OF THE FIELD IN BYTES (1-2 DECIMAL
DIGITS) AND X SIGNIFIES A HEXADECIMAL FIELD; C,
A CHARACTER FIELD AND P A PACKED DECIMAL FIELD
(SEE RECORD STATEMENT). IF THIS ENTRY IS
OMITTED, EACH RECORD WILL BE EDITED, PROVIDING
THAT THE KEY FIELD IS SATISFIED.
B) KEY=(D,K)
THIS ENTRY DEFINES A SECONDARY CONTROL FIELD.  D
IF THE DISPLACEMENT OF THIS ONE BYTE FIELD (1-4
DECIMAL DIGITS),K IS A SINGLE CHARACTER DEFINING
THE VALUE OF THIS FIELD FOR RECORDS WHICH ARE TO
BE EDITED. IF THIS ENTRY IS OMITTED, EACH RECORD
WILL BE EDITED, PROVIDING THAT THE CONTROL FIELD
IS SATISFIED.
C) SEARCH
THIS ENTRY IS USED IF THE WHOLE FILE IS TO BE
SCANNED FOR RECORDS TO BE EDITED. IF IT IS NOT
SPECIFIED, THEN THE EDIT WILL TERMINATE WHEN A
RECORD GREATER THAN THE HIGH CONTROL FIELD IS
FOUND.
D) BLOCK
THIS ENTRY IS USED IF SELECTION IS TO BE CONTROLLED
BY THE RELATIVE BLOCK NUMBER IN THE FILE. THE
FIRST DATA BLOCK IS NUMBER 1. IF THIS ENTRY IS
USED THEN FIELD, KEY AND SEARCH HAVE NO MEANING
AND SHOULD NOT BE SPECIFIED.
10.5.5.3. RECORD STATEMENT
STATEMENT DEFINER: RECORD.
PARAMETER ENTRIES:
A) LOW=(XXX...)
THIS DEFINES THE LOWEST VALUE OF CONTROL FIELD
IN RECORDS TO BE EDITED.
B) HIGH=(XXX...)
THIS DEFINES THE HIGHEST VALUE OF CONTROL FIELD
IN RECORDS TO BE EDITED.
IF FIELD IS SPECIFIED IN THE CONTROL STATEMENT, IN
BOTH THESE ENTRIES THE VALUE WILL REPRESENT THE
CONTENT OF THE CONTROL FIELD AND SHOULD REPRESENT A
BYTE STRING OF THE LENGTH SPECIFIED IN THE FIELD
ENTRY. IF THE FORMAT SPECIFIED IN THE FIELD ENTRY IS
X EACH COLUMN OF THIS VALUE REPRESENTS ONE HEXADECIMAL
DIGIT, A MAXIMUM OF 24 COLUMNS MAY BE USED. IF THE
FORMAT SPECIFIED IS C, EACH COLUMN REPRESENTS ONE
BYTE, A MAXIMUM OF 20 COLUMNS MAY BE USED. IF THE
FORMAT SPECIFIED IS P, EACH COLUMN REPRESENTS A ZONED
DECIMAL DIGIT, A MAXIMUM OF 25 COLUMNS MAY BE USED.
IF BLOCK IS SPECIFIED IN THE CONTROL STATEMENT, IN
BOTH THESE ENTRIES THE VALUE WILL REPRESENT A RELATIVE
BLOCK NUMBER AT WHICH EDITING IS TO COMMENCE OR
TERMINATE. A MAXIMUM OF 5 DIGITS IS ALLOWED.
IF BOTH PARAMETER ENTRIES ARE OMITTED, LOW IS ASSUMED
TO BE A STRING OF HEXADECIMAL ZEROS AND HIGH IS ASSUMED
TO BE A STRING OF HEXADECIMAL F'S. IF ONE OF THESE
PARAMETER ENTRIES IS OMITTED IT IS ASSUMED TO BE
EQUAL TO THE VALUE SPECIFIED FOR THE OTHER.
10.5.5.4. END STATEMENT
STATEMENT DEFINER: END
PARAMETER ENTRIES: NONE
10.5.6. UTILISATION
10.5.6.1. IF FIELD OR BLOCK IS NOT USED ALL RECORDS IN THE
FILE (PROVIDING THAT KEY, IF SPECIFIED, IS SATISFIED)
WILL BE EDITED.  IN THIS WAY A WHOLE FILE CAN BE
EDITED.
10.5.6.2. IF FIELD IS SPECIFIED, RECORDS ARE EDITED THAT HAVE
A CONTROL FIELD WITHIN THE RANGE OF LOW AND HIGH
IF KEY IS SPECIFIED THEN ONLY RECORDS CONTAINING
THAT KEY ARE EDITED.
10.5.6.3. IF BLOCK IS SPECIFIED, BLOCKS WHOSE RELATIVE BLOCK
NUMBER IS IN THE RANGE OF LOW AND HIGH WILL BE
EDITED (BY RECORDS, DEPENDING ON THE FILE STATEMENT).
10.5.6.4. IF NO PARAMETER STATEMENTS ARE SUBMITTED, THE PRESET
OPTIONS WILL CAUSE EACH BLOCK OF THE FILE TO BE
EDITED. BY USING A FILE STATEMENT, EACH RECORD
OF THE FILE CAN BE EDITED.
10.5.6.5. IF ANY PARAMETER STATEMENTS ARE OMITTED FROM THE
RUN-TIME PARAMETERS, A REQUEST WILL BE ISSUED TO THE
CONSOLE AND THE OPERATOR HAS THE OPTION OF ENTERING
THE STATEMENTS REQUIRED. IF THERE ARE NONE REQUIRED.
AN END STATEMENT MUST BE ENTERED.
10.5.7 EXAMPLES
10.5.7.1. TO EDIT EACH RECORD OF A FILE WITH VARIABLE RECORDS:
 FILE TYPE=V
 CONTROL
 RECORD
THE PRESENCE OF THE CONTROL AND RECORD PARAMETERS
WILL PREVENT THE OPERATOR BEING REQUESTED TO SUBMIT
THE COLTROL AND RECORD PARAMETERS.
10.5.7.2. TO EDIT ALL RECORDS OF A FILE WITH FIXED RECORDS
CONTAINING 11 IN THE FIRST TWO BYTES:-
 FILE TYPE=F,LENGTH=30
 CONTROL FIELD=(0,2,C),SEARCH
 RECORD LOW=(11)
10.5.7.3. TO EDIT ALL RECORDS OF A FILE WITH FIXED RECORDS
CONTAINING 11 OR GREATER IN THE FIRST TWO BYTES:
 FILE TYPE=F,LENGTH=30
 CONTROL FIELD=(0,2,C),SEARCH
 RECORD LOW=(11),HIGH=(  )
10.5.7.4. TO EDIT EACH BLOCK OF A FILE:
 FILE
 CONTROL
 RECORD
THE PRESENCE OF THESE PARAMETERS WILL PREVENT THE
OPERATING BEING REQUESTED TO SUBMIT PARAMETERS.
