IEBUPDTE IS A WRAP-AROUND FOR THE STANDARD IBM UTILITY, WHICH IT
DYNAMICALLY LINKS TO (BY THE NAME IBMUPDTE). IT HAS THE FOLLOWING
FEATURES:
(I) IT ENQ'S ON THE OUTPUT DATA SET NAME, USING THE SAME
QNAME AS THE LINKAGE EDITOR (I.E. SYSIEWL), THUS ALLOWING
UPDATE/COMPILE/LINK PROCEDURES TO RUN IN SEVERAL
PARTITIONS.
(II) IT DOES A SCAN AND UPDATE IN PLACE OF THE COMTROL CARDS,
AND IF SO SSI IS SPECIFIED, IT GENERATES SSI IN THE FORM
SSI = YYDDD0VV
WHERE VV IS A VERSION NUMBER, INCREMENTED BY ONE EACH TIME THE
MODULE IS UPDATED. (NOTE THAT THIS UPDATE-IN-PLACE MEANS
THAT CONTROL CANNOT BE HELD ON TAPE).
JCL
AS FOR STANDARD IBM VERSION
