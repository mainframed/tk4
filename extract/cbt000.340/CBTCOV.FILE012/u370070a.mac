 THIS PROGRAM ACCEPTS AS INPUT THE SOURCE STATEMENTS OF AN ASSEMBLER
MACRO, OF WHICH THE FIRST CARD MUST BE 'MACRO' AND THE LAST CARD MUST
BE 'MEND'. THE CARDS WILL BE LISTED WITH A SEQUENTIAL STATEMENT NUMBER,
AND FOLLOWING THIS A CROSS-REFERENCE WILL BE GIVEN OF ALL SYMBOLS WHICH
BEGIN WITH A FULL-STOP(INTERNAL BRANCHES) OR AN AMPERSAND(SYMBOLIC NAMES
 THE PROGRAM CHECKS THE FIRST CARD FOR A 'MACRO', AND ASSUMES THAT THE
SECOND CARD(WITH ANY CONTINUATIONS) IS THE MODEL STATEMENT. ALL CARDS
ARE SCANNED FOR THE OCCURRENCE OF REQUIRED NAMES, AND THESE ARE PLACED
IN A TABLE WHICH IS LATER SORTED, TO PRODUCE A FORMATTED CROSS-REF
EACH INPUT, AS WELL AS BEING LISTED, IS WRITTEN TO AN OUTPUT FILE,
SO THAT IF REQUIRED THIS PROGRAM CAN BE A STEP IN AN ASSEMBLY.
