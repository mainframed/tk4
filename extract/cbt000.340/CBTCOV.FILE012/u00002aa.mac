***      THIS TAPE CONTAINS A SERIES OF PROGRAMS WRITTEN BY THE
***      TECHNICAL SUPPORT GROUP OF THE IBM RESPOND CENTRE AT HAVANT.
*
*        THIS IS THE SECOND OF TWO TAPES FORMING THE EIGHTH ISSUE OF
*        RESPOND UTILITES. BOTH TAPES ARE IN THE SAME FORMAT WITH
*        FILE 01 BEING AN UNBLOCKED 'DESCRIPTION OF CONTENTS'.
*        MOST OF THE PROGRAMS ARE IN GENERAL USE AT RESPOND UNDER
*        REL 19 (BOTH MVT AND MFT).
*
*
*
*        THE MAIN DIFFERENCES IN THE EIGHTH ISSUE ARE....
*              FILE 03 SPMODE MACRO CHANGED TO COMPATIBLE WITH REL 20
*              FILE 07 PL1LINK. HAS AN ADDITIONAL ENTRY POINT 'PLILINK'
*                      TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE NEW PL/1 PROGRAM
*                      PRODUCTS.
*              FILE 10 RTPMNIT (=RTP5012M).  WILL NOW IGNORE PRESENCE
*                      OF LOADER IF OPTION 6 IS SPECIFIED (I.E. 6
*                      FORCES LINK EDIT).  A REL 19 BUG AFFECTING
*                      BLKSIZE FOR PL/1 SYSPRINT IS CORRECTED.  THIS
*                      VERSION USES ASSEBLER H IF AVAILABLE AND IF
*                      THERE IS 200K OF CORE.
*              FILE 11 RTP5013M - SECOND PART OF RTPMNIT.
*              FILE 20 COPYCAT.  AN ERROR WHICH ONLY OCCURRED WHEN
*                      THERE WERE MORE THAN 256 INDEXES AT THE SAME
*                      LEVEL OF THE CATALOGUE HAS BEEN CORRECTED.
*                      THE PROGRAM HAS ALSO BEEN ALTERED TO PROCESS
*                      INDEX ALIASES CORRECTLY (PREVIOUSLY THEY WERE
*                      IGNORED).
*              FILE 27 RTP5031M.  NEW PROGRAM (SEE FOCUS 34)
*              FILE 28 TSGTRACE.  NEW PROGRAM (SEE FOCUS 35)
*              FILE 29 RTPDREAM.  NEW PROGRAM (SEE FOCUS 35)
*              FILE 30 TAPESCAN.  NEW PROGRAM (SEE FOCUS 35)
*
*        THIS VERSION OF THE EIGHTH ISSUE HAS FILE 3 (RESPOND MACROS)
*        CHANGED TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR YOU TO CONTROL THE DESTINATION
*        LIBRARY, AND TO ENSURE THAT VERSIONS OF MACROS YOU MAY HAVE
*        TAKEN FROM EARLIER ISSUES ARE NOW REPLACED.  THE JCL HAS BEEN
*        REMOVED (FILE 3 WILL NOW BE THE SYSIN FOR AN IEBUPDTE JOB STEP
*        YOU MUST SET UP) AND THE PROPER VERSIONS OF THE MACROS ARE
*        PRECEDED BY ./ REPL CARDS (DUMMY MEMBERS WITH THE SAME NAMES
*        ARE FIRST ADDED TO MAKE THIS WORK IN ALL CASES).
*
*
         DIFFERENCES IN THE SEVENTH ISSUE WERE....
         FILE 07 - PL1LINK.  NEW RE-ENTRANT VERSION WITH MACROS PL1REGS
                   AND PL1STRG.
         FILE 14 - TSGLIMIT/PLOT/TIME.  NEW VERSION.
         FILE 20 - COPYCAT.  NEW PROGRAM.
         FILE 21 - PUNCHCAT.  NEW PROGRAM.
         FILE 22 - COMPLIB.  NEW PROGRAM.
         FILE 23 - RTP5033M.  NEW PROGRAM
         FILE 24 - RTP5034M.  NEW PROGRAM
         FILE 25 - RTP5035M.  NEW PROGRAM
         FILE 26 - TAPESET.  NEW PROGRAM
*
*        THE MAIN DIFFERENCES IN THE SIXTH FROM THE FIFTH ISSUE WERE..
*        FILE 3  - THE MACROS PRINCORE AND FINDUCB MACROS HAVE BEEN
*                  AMENDED.
*        FILE 10 - RTP5012M DID NOT CALL THE LINK-EDITOR CORRECTLY IN
*                  THE EXCEPTIONAL CASE WHERE THE LOADER WAS NOT USED.
*        FILE 14 - TSGLIMIT/PLOT/TIME HAVE BEEN CORRECTED FOR MVT USE.
*        FILE 15 - TSGLINK ROOT MODULE HAS BEEN AMENDED TO AVOID A
*                  SCHEDULER LOOP AT END OF STEP IF THE TIOT DDNAMES
*                  ARE DIFFERENT AT END OF STEP FROM THE ORIGINAL TIOT.
*        FILE 19 - SMFRESQ HAS BEEN ADDED.  THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF HOW
*                  TO RECOVER SMF RECORDS THAT WERE LEFT IN THE BUFFER
*                  AT TIME OF O.S. COLLAPSE.  THIS VERSION IS DEPENDENT
*                  ON THE USE OF THE RESPOND 'INTERRUPT DUMP' BUT THE
*                  TECHNIQUE MAY BE OF INTEREST TO OTHERS.
*

*        WE HAVE UNFORTUNATELY HAD TO ABANDON OUR INTENTION OF
*        EXPANDING ALL THE LOCAL MACROS IN OUR SOURCE DECKS AND WE
*        HAVE INSTEAD PROVIDED IN FILE 3 A SYSIN DATA SET FOR IEBUPDTE
*        TO ALLOW YOU TO ADD/REPL THE NECESSARY RESPOND MACROS IN A
*        PRIVATE MACLIB (TO BE CONCATENATED BEFORE SYS1.MACLIB IN
*        SUBSEQUENT ASSEMBLIES) OR IN YOUR SYS1.MACLIB.
***      THE PROGRAMS ARE IN THE FOLLOWING SEQUENCE OF FILE NUMBERS..

*MEMBER  U00002BM
RESPOND MACROS.  BEFORE ASSEMBLING ANY PROGRAMS FROM THIS TAPE YOU ARE
         ADVISED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LATEST VERSIONS OF THE FOLLOWING
         MACROS ARE AVAILABLE.  THEY ARE RECORDED ON THIS TAPE IN A
         FORM SUITABLE FOR THE SYSIN DATA SET OF AN IEBUPDTE JOB STEP
         BEGIN - EXTENDED 'SAVE' MACRO.
         GOBACK - EXTENDED 'RETURN' MACRO.
         HEXPRINT - CONVERTS ANY STRING OF BYTES TO  EX CHARACTERS
           (WITH OPTIONAL INSERTION OF BLANKS BETWEEN GROUPS)
         PRINCORE - USES HEXPRINT TO FORMAT ANY AREA OF CORE AND SEND
           IT TO A PRINT FILE IN O.S. DUMP FORMAT  SNAP WILL NOT ALLOW
           YOU TO PRINT LIMITED PARTS OF THE NUCLEUS OR CORE BELONGING
           TO ANOTHER TASK.
         TSGSNAP - PROVIDES ALL NORMAL SNAP FACILITIES BUT SAVES YOU
           FROM SETTING UP A DCB AND OPENING IT.  YOU MUST PROVIDE A
           'SNAPOUT' DD CARD.
         FINDUCB - RETURNS A UCB ADDRESS IN RETURN FOR A SPECIFIC UNIT
           ADDRESS
           NAME.  WILL CHECK THAT UCB + 13 HAS NAME +UOTED.
         SPMODE - ALLOWS YOU TO CONTROL THE PROTECT KEY AND MODE (SUPVR
           OR PROBLEM) OF YOUR CURRENT PSW.  REQUIRES SVC 54 WHICH
           WILL BE IN YOUR SYSTEM IF YOU SPECIFIED ISAM AT SYSGEN.
         TSGINNRA,B,C,D - INNER MACROS.
         DATE - EDITS A PACKED FORMAT DATE (YYDDD)TO ANY SPECIFICATION
           GIVEN BY THE FORMAT= KEYWORD AND PLACES THE RESULT IN A
           FIELD SPECIFIED BY THE FIRST POSITIONAL PARAMETER.
           'SEPARATOR' CHARACTERS MAY BE GIVEN IN THE FORMAT= PARM OR
           MAY BESTATED TO BE ALREADY IN THE RESULT FIELD (PREFORM=YES)
           DON'T FORGET TO ENCLOSE THE FORMAT SPECIFICATION IN BRACKETS
           E.G.   DATE  CHARDATE,PACKDATE,FORMAT=(DD/MM/YY)
         DCBEXITS --SEE FOCUS VOL 22 PAGE 19.  ALLOWS A BLOCKSIZE CODED
           IN THE PROGRAM TO BE OVERRIDDEN BY A DD CARD.
         DLINE - AN AID TO SETTING UP FORMAT V PRINT LINES WITH CONTROL
           CHARACTERS (RECFM=VA/M OR VBA/M)

*MEMBER  U00002CS
OUTRACE  THIS IS A PL/1 SOURCE DECK TO ANALYSE AN OVERLAY TRACE DATA
         SET (DDNAME = TRACE) PRODUCED BY OVLTRACE.  COUNTS THE NUMBER
         OF BRANCHES TO EACH SEGMENT, SORTS THE RESULTS INTO DECREASING
         FREQUENCY OF CALL, AND PRINTS THE TOTALS ON SYSPRINT.

*MEMBER  U00002DS
PL1LINK  AN ASSEMBLER ROUTINE WHICH CAN BE CALLED BY PL/1 PROGRAMS TO
         ALLOW THEM TO LINK TO IBM UTILITIES (OR TO ANY PROGRAM).
         COMPILE AND LINK THIS MODULE INTO PL1LIB, THEN INCLUDE IN PL/1
         PROGRAMS 'CALL PL1LINK(2 - 5 PARAMETERS);'.  THE REQUIRED
         PARAMETERS ARE....
           PROGRAM NAME (TO BE LINKED TO).
           RETURN CODE FIELD ADDRESS (TO RECEIVE RETURN CODE)
           PARM 1 (AND ONLY PARM FOR MOST PROGRAMS).
           PARM 2 (OPTIONAL - LIST OF ALTERNATE DDNAMES FOR IBM UTILS)
           PARM 3 (OPTIONAL - INITIAL PAGE NUMBER FOR IBM UTILS).

*MEMBER  U00002ES
RTPMCOPY A SPECIALISED PROGRAM USED FOR CREATING THIS MULTI-FILE TAPE
         FROM VARIOUS SOURCES.  INCLUDED BECAUSE IT COULD EASILY BE
         ADAPTED TO SIMILAR TASKS.  WILL PRODUCE UP TO 5 COPIES OF ITS
         OUTPUT TAPE SIMULTANEOUSLY AND SAVES YOU SETTING UP JCL FOR
         A LARGE NUMBER OF IEBGENER STEPS.  INSTEAD YOU SPECIFY IN A
         SYSIN STRR
         SYSIN STREAM, FOR EACH FILE TO BE INCLUDED IN THE OUTPUT, -
           ..FILE NN FROM MM
         WHERE NN IS THE 2 DIGIT NUMBER OF THE OUTPUT FILE, AND MM IS
         ONE OF THREE TYPES OF VALUE........
           *  MEANS DATA CARDS FOLLOW (UP TO NEXT ..FILE OR /* CARD)
           A 2 DIGIT NUMBER MEANS 'COPY THE DATA FROM THE FILE NUMBER
             GIVEN ON AN OLD ''EXPORT TAPE'' '
           ANY OTHER SYMBOL IS TAKEN TO BE THE DDNAME OF A DD CARD
             SPECIFYING THE ORIGIN OF THE FILE (E.G. A MEMBER OF A DISK
             PDS).

*MEMBER  U00002FS
RTPSTOW  THE IBM STOW MACRO (WITH ADD OR REPLACE FUNCTION) WRITES A
         FILE MARK AT THE DISK ADDRESS GIVEN BY THE FDAD FIELD OF THE
         ASSOCIATED DCB, THUS ERASING THE REST OF THAT TRACK AS WELL
         AS UPDATING THE DIRECTORY.  RTPSTOW UPDATES THE DIRECTORY
         WITHOUT WRITING A FILE MARK, ALLOWING SIMPLE AMENDMENT TO
         EXISITING DIRECTORY ENTRIES.

*MEMBER  U00002GS
RTP5012M WITH RTP5013M THIS IS THE RESPOND 'ONESTEP' COMPILE/LINK/GO
         TESTING MONITOR.  YOU SPECIFY A PARM WHICH SELECTS THE
         COMPILER (ONE OF 8 LANGUAGES), THE RUN TYPE (5 ALLOWED FROM
         'COMPILE ONLY' TO 'GO ONLY'), THE ERROR LEVEL (RETURN CODE)
         TO CAUSE ABNORMAL TERMINATION, A TIME LIMIT IN MINUTES, PLUS
         PARAMETERS -IF ANY- FOR THE GO STEP.
         ANYONE WISHING TO USE IT SHOULD CONTACT ALAN MORRISH OF
         RESPOND TSG IF NEEDING HELP IN SETTING UP A CATALOGUED
         PROCEDURE TO RUN IT.

*MEMBER  U00002HS
RTP5013M SEE RTP5012M.

*MEMBER  U00002IS
RTP5017M I/O INTERRUPT TRAP ROUTINE.  RUNS FOR THE NUMBER OF MINUTES
         SPECIFIED IN THE PARM AND THEN PRINTS (SYSPRINT DD) THE COUNT
         OF INTERRUPTS FOR EVERY DEVICE IN THE SYSTEM .  IF PARM IS
         OMITTED OR INVALID IT ISSUES A WTOR ASKING THE OPERATOR TO
         STOP THE TRACE (BY REPLY) WHEN REQUIRED.

*MEMBER  U00002JS
SETMODE  ALLOWS PL/1 PROGRAMS TO PROCESS TAPES OF UNKNOWN MODE 3R
         DENSITY.  BEFORE OPENING THE TAPE IN PL/1 YOU PASS TO SETMODE
         THE DDNAME IDENTIFYING THE TAPE AND SETMODE USES EXCP TO TRY
         VARIOUS MODES AND DENSITIES UNTIL IT FINDS ONE WHICH READS
         WITHOUT ERROR.  IT THEN UPDATES THE PL/1 PROGRAM'S JFCB SO
         THAT IT WILL HAVE THE CORRECT MODE/DENSITY WHEN IT OPENS THE
         TAPE.

*MEMBER  U00002KS
TSGLIMIT,PLOT,TIME.  SEE FOCUS VOL 23.  TRACES THE OPERATION OF A PL/1
         PROGRAM (WHICH HAS THE STMT OPTION) BY SETTING UP ITS OWN SPIE
         AND CAUSING A PROGRAM CHECK EVERY TIME THE STATEMENT NUMBER IS
         UPDATED.

*MEMBER  U00002LS
TSGLROOT THE ROOT OF 'TSGLINK'.  WITH TSGLSHED AND TSGLISAM THIS WILL
         ALLOW EXECUTION OF ANY NUMBER OF PROGRAMS AS ONE JOBSTEP AND
         IT CAN SAVE 80 PERCENT OF SCHEDULER TIME FOR MANY STEP JOBS
         BESIDES AVOIDING DELAYS WAITING FOR THE SCHEDULER.
         USED IN REGULAR PRODUCTION JOBS AT RESPOND UNDER MFT AND HAS
         BEEN TESTED UNDER MVT.  CONTACT RALPH HOLLINS AT RESPOND TSG
         IF YOU ARE INTERESTED AND WISH FOR DOCUMENTATION.
         WARNING:  THE SET UP OF THE CARD INPUT TO CONTROL THE RUN AND
         ORGANIZATION OF SUITABLE JCL IS DIFFICULT, BUT IT CAN BE WORTH
         WHILE IF YOU HAVE A REGULAR JOB WITH VERY MANY STEPS.

*MEMBER  U00002MS
TSGLSHED PART OF TSGLINK.  THIS IS THE 'PSEUDO-SCHEDULER' LINKED TO BY
         TSGLROOT BETWEEN EACH 'PSEUDO STEP'.  PROCESSES RETURN CODES,
         SETS UP PARM FIELDS, ALLOCATES NEW DISK DAT SETS, MAINTAINS
         THE CATLG AND VTOCS, AND MANIPULTES THE TIOT WHEN DIFFERENT
         PROGRAMS WANT THE SAME DDNAME FOR DIFFERENT DAT SETS.

*MEMBER  U00002NS
TSGLISAM LINKED TO BY TSGLSHED ONLY TO ALLOCATE NEW ISAM DATA SETS.
         BASED ON DSCBISAM.

*MEMBER  U00002OS
TSGVIPL  AN ABBREVIATED SMARTNIP FOR DISK ONLY.  WRITTEN BECAUSE OUT
         REL 19 SMF WENT INTO A WAIT AT INITIALIZATION IF ANY ONLINE
         DASD WAS NOT READY.  TSGVIPL VARIES OFFLINE ANY DRIVE FOR
         WHICH NIP HAS NOT READ A VOL SERIAL.  NOTE THAT OPERATOR
         INITIATED 'VARY OFFLINE' COMMANDS ARE NOT PROCESSED UNTIL
         AFTER SMF INITIALIZATION.
         TSGVIPL IS ONLY NECESSARY IF YOU SELECT THE SMF 'DSV' OPTION,
         AND THERE ARE OTHER WAYS OF AVOIDING THE PROBLEM (WHICH
         OCCURS WHEN IEESMFI2 ISSUES AN SVC 78 TO A NOT READY DEVICE)
         E.G. IF YOU HAVE NO ALTERNATE PATHS IN YOUR SYSTEM YOU CAN
         ZAP THE INSTRUCTIONS IN IEESMFI2 WHICH TEST FOR ALTERNATE PATH
         AND MAKE THEM TEST UCBFL1 FOR 'NOT READY'.

*MEMBER  U00002PS
SMFRESQ. THIS PROGRAM RECOVERS SMF RECORDS LEFT IN THE BUFFER AT TIME
         OF O.S. COLLAPSE AND RE-ISSUES THEM USING SVC 83.  IT GETS ITS
         INPUT FROM THE CORE IMAGE STORED ON DISK BY THE RESPOND
         'INTERRUPT DUMP' ROUTINE BUT IT COULD BE ADAPTED TO PROCESS
         ANY FORM OF CORE IMAGE DUMP AFTER O.S. RESTART.

*MEMBER  U00002QS
COPYCAT. THIS PROGRAM MAKES A RESTRUCTURED COPY OF ANY SYSCTLG DATA SET
         TO ALLOW YOU TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE REL 19 PERFOR,ANCE
         IMPROVEMENT WHEREBY INDEXES ARE SEARCHED BY KEY INSTEAD OF
         BEING READ BLOCK BY BLOCK.  ONE TEST SHOWED A 100% IMPROVEMENT
         IN SPEED OF CATLG LOOK UP AFTER RUNNING THIS PROGRAM.
         IT WILL ALSO COPY A WHOLE CATLG TO ANOTHER PACK AT A SPEED 8
         TO 10 TIMES OR MORE FASTER THAN IEHMOVE (BUT IT DOES NOT COPY
         DUMMY DSCBS AND WILL NOT MERGE WITH AN EXISTING CATLG).
*MEMBER  U00002RS
PUNCHCAT THIS PROGRAM WAS WRITTEN TO CORRECT THE ENTRIES IN A SYSTEM
         CATLG AFTER THE SYSTEM HAD BEEN COPIED TO NEW PACKS WITH NEW
         VOL SERIALS (I.E. TO SWOP ALL OCCURRENCES OF THE OLD FOR THE
         NEW SERIALS).
         SINCE IT CREATES A CARD DECK FOR IEHPROGM TO REMOVE EVERY
         EXISTING ENTRY IN THE CATLG AND THEN TO RECREATE IT (WITH THE
         AUTOMATIC SWOPPING OF VOL SERIALS) IT CAN BE USED AS A SHORT
         CUT TO PREPARING A DECK FOR ANY MAJOR ALTERATIONS TO A LARGE
         CATALOGUE
*MEMBER  U00002SS
COMPLIB. THIS PROGRAM READS EVERY RECORD OF EVERY ACTIVE MEMBER OF ANY
         PDS LOOKING FOR I/O ERRORS OR POTENTIAL ERRORS.  IT LISTS
         EACH MEMBER SHOWING THE NUMBER OF PHYSICAL BLOCKS AND THE
         START AND END DISK ADDRESSES, AND ALSO INDICATES....
               TEMPORARY I/O ERRORS.
               PERMANENT I/O ERRORS.
               'OVERLAPPING' MEMBERS.
               MEMBERS WHICH BRIDGE EXTENTS.
               OVERFLOW RECORDS (FOR WHICH THE NUMBER OF BYTES READ
                   DIFFERS FROM THE COUNT FIELD OF THE RECORD).
         BY USING 'PARM=CREATE' IN ONE RUN AND 'PARM=VERIFY' IN A
         SUBSEQUENT RUN AFTER E.G. A COMPRESS IN PLACE OPERATION IT CAN
         BE USED TO CHECK THAT ALL MEMBERS HAVE THE SAME NUMBER OF
         PHYSICAL BLOCKS AFTER AS BEFORE THE OPERATION.

*MEMBER  U00002TS
RTP5033M WHEN A JOB SPECIFIES 'DISP=OLD' ON A NON-TEMPORARY DATA SET,
         THAT DATA SET IS RESERVED EXCLUSIVELY FOR THE DURATION OF THE
         JOB. THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS THE USER TO RELEASE THE DATA SET FOR
         THE STEPS WITHIN HIS JOB WHERE IT IS SAFE SO TO DO, AND TO
         RE-RESERVE THE DATA SET WHEN NEEDED. (FOCUS 34)

*MEMBER  U00002US
RTP5034M THIS PROGRAM TAKES SNAPS OF THE SYSTEM QUEUE AREA AT INTERVALS
         CHOSEN BY THE USER AND FOR A PERIOD CHOSEN BY THE USER. THE
         OUTPUT CAN BE WRITTEN TO SYSPRINT OR TO THE OPERATOR (HARD
         COPY ONLY IF MCS). THE OUTPUT CONSISTS OF DATA AND TIME, THE
         SQA SIZE, THE TOTAL FREE SPACE, THE SIZE OF THE LARGEST FREE
         AREA AND THE TOTAL NUMBER OF FREE BLOCKS.

*MEMBER  U00002VS
RTP5035M THIS PROGRAM TRANSFERS CONTROL TO THE PROGRAM SPECIFIED IN THE
         PARAMETER LIST, THUS ENABLING START COMMAND PROCEDURE CONTROL
         AT THE PROCEDURE LEVEL. (FOCUS 33)

*MEMBER  U00002WS
TAPESET. THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS YOU TO CREATE ANY NUMBER OF NULL
         GENERATIONS BEFORE STARTING TO USE A GDG WITH JCL THAT CYCLES
         THE TAPE VOLUMES.  IF THE OPERATIONAL JCL OVERWRITES +1 ON -3
         VOLUME YOU CAN USE THE STANDARD JCL FROM THE START IF YOU
         HAVE CREATED NULL GENERATIONS 1 TO 4 (CORRECTLY LABELLED WITH
         THE APPROPRIATE DSNAMES, BUT HAVING NO DATA), AND THIS PROGRAM
         CREATES SUCH A SET OF TAPES (BY OPEN/CLOSE AND CATALOGUE FOR
         EACH SUCCESSIVE GENERATION) AND INSTRUCTS THE OPERATOR TO
         LABEL THE TAPES AS THEY ARE CREATED, ALL IN RESPONSE TO ONE
         SYSIN CARD.

*MEMBER  U00002XS
RTP5031M ANALYSES DISK PACKS FOR BAD TRACKS AND GENERATES 'GETALTS'.
         ALSO SHOWS TO WHICH TRACKS ALTERNATES ARE CURRENTLY ALLOCATED.

*MEMBER  U00002YS
TSGTRACE INTERCEPTS ALL ENTRIES TO THE STANDARD O.S. TRACE AND CREATES
         A TRACE TABLE WITH MUCH MORE DATA (JOB,STEP,RB NAMES, PSW,CSW,
         ALL REGS 0 - 15, AND TIME OF DAY). USER CAN SUPPLY HIS OWN
         EXIT ROUTINES TO BE EXECUTED IN THE TRACE AND/OR PRINT PHASES.
         BY ALLOWING YOU ACCESS TO O.S. AT EVERY INTERRUPT IT PROVIDES
         A POWERFUL TOOL FOR MANY PROBLEM SOLVING AND INFORMATION
         COLLECTION APPLICATIONS.
         THE MAIN DIFFERENCES FROM THE TFLOW SERVICE AID ARE THAT IT
         DOES NOT REQUIRE A TAPE TO BE MOUNTED (BY SUPPRESSING THE
         NORMAL OUTSTANDING WTOR THE OPERATOR NEED NOT BE AWARE THAT
         THE TRACE IS RUNNING), AND THE BASIC TRACE TABLE ENTRIES
         CONTAIN MORE DATA (INCLUDING ALL THE REGISTERS FOR THE TASK
         IN CONTROL AT TIME OF INTERRUPT).

*MEMBER  U00002ZS
RTPDREAM THIS PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED FOR TECHNICAL SUPPORT STAFF USING
         2260'S AT THEIR DESKS TO INSPECT AND MODIFY A RUNNING O.S.
         SYSTEM.  IT CAN BE USED (I.E. REQUESTS CAN BE ENTERED) THROUGH
         AN OPERATOR CONSOLE, A NON CONSOLE 2260, SYSIN CARDS, OR THE
         EXEC CARD PARM FIELD.  IN ADDITION TO PERFORMING MOST
         FUNCTIONS OF IEHLIST + IEHPROGM IT CAN ALSO BE USED TO CREATE
         A DATA SET, TO ATTACH A SUB-TASK (E.G. A COMPILER, AFTER
         CREATING A SOURCE DATA SET), TO SEND MESSAGES TO OTHER
         CONSOLES, AND/OR TO ENTER OPERATOR COMMANDS.  THE PROGRAM WILL
         LATER BE EXTENDED TO PROVIDE SUPERZAP AND COREZAP FUNCTIONS.
*MEMBER  U000020S
HEX      A PL/1 FUNCTION (WRITTEN IN ASSEMBLER) TO CONVERT A STRING OF
         BYTES TO HEX CHARACTERS.  COMPILE AND LINK INTO PL1LIB.

*MEMBER  U000021S
OVLTRACE RECORDS EVERY OVERLAY BRANCH AS IT IS EXECUTED ON A DATA SET
         (DDNAME = OVTRACE) FOR SUBSEQUENT ANALYSIS BY OUTRACE PROGRAM.
         YOU LINK-EDIT OVLTRACE WITH THE STANDARD IEWZOVR MODULE (SEE
         INSTRUCTIONS IN SOURCE COMMENTS) BEFORE RUNNING THE OVERLAY
         PROGRAM TO BE STUDIED.

*MEMBER  U000022S
COPYCAT   WATERLOO COPY CATALOG PROGRAM.
          PROVIDES A VERY FAST MEANS OF COPYING A CATALOG FROM ONE
          DASD TO ANOTHER
