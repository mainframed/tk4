Z26MARS
MEMBER ALIAS,RENAME AND SCRATCH ROUTINE
1) GENERAL DESCRIPTION
THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES A REPLACEMENT FOR THE FUNCTIONS OF THE
IEHPROGM UTILITY WHICH RELATE TO PARTITIONED DATA SETS. THE
CONTROL CARDS ARE MUCH SIMPLER, AND THE OVERHEAD OF HAVING TO
OPEN AND CLOSE THE PARTITIONED DATA SET EACH TIME A MEMBER IS
DELETED OF RENAMED IS AVOIDED. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT
FOR PROTECTED DATA SETS, SINCE EACH TIME THE DATA SET IS OPENED
AN EXPIRY DATE MESSAGE IS SENT TO THE CONSOLE.
THE PROGRAM ALSO PROVIDES TWO FACILITIES NOT AVAILABLE THROUGH
IEHPROGM, VIZ:
1. SCRATCHING A MEMBER WHOSE NAME IS SPECIFIED IN THE PARM
FIELD OF THE EXEC STATEMENT.
2. ALIASING MEMBERS OF ANY LIBRARY.
THIS PROGRAM SHOULD BE USED IN PREFERENCE TO IEHPROGM
FOR LIBRARY MAINTENANCE, SINCE THE USE OF IEHPROGM WILL
BE RESTRICTED IN THE NEAR FUTURE.
2) CONTROL CARDS
ALL THE CONTROL CARDS ARE FREE FORMAT. IF A LABEL IS SPECIFIED
IT MAY BE UP TO EIGHT ALPHA NUMERIC CHARACTERS LONG, AND MUST
START IN COLUMN 1.
THE FORMAT OF THE CONTROL CARD TO SCRATCH MEMBERS IS:-
LABEL SCRATCH DDNAME (MEMBER1, MEMBER2, ---, MEMBER N)
LABEL SCRA DDNAME (MEMBER1, MEMBER2, ---,MEMBER N)
LABEL S DDNAME (MEMBER1, MEMBER2, ---, MEMBER N)
THE FORMAR FOR ALIASING MEMBER IS:-
LABEL     ALIAS     DDNAME((MEMBER1,ALIAS1),----(MEMBERN,ALIASN))
LABEL     A
THE FORMAT FOR RENAMING MEMBER IS:-
LABEL RENAME DDNAME ((MEMBER1, NEW NAME1), --- (MEMBER N,
NEW NAME N))
LABEL R DDNAME ((MEMBER1, NEW NAME1), --- (MEMBER N,
NEW NAME N))
IN EACH CASE UP TO 50 BLANKS MAY BE SPECIFIED BETWEEN LABEL AND
FUNCTION, AND FUNCTION AND DDNAME. ANY NUMBER OF MEMBERS MAY BE
SPECIFIED ON ONE CARD, BUT NO CONTINUATION CARDS ARE ALLOWED, I.E.,
THE CLOSING BRACKEY MUST BE ON OR BEFORE COLUMN 80.
     COL.1

IF IT REQUIRED TO SCRATCH A MEMBER SPECIFIED IN THE PARM FIELD,
