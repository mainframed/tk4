****************  TO ALTER CAPACITY OF LINK EDITOR ************
**********     AND SELECT MAP OPTIONS              ************
***   ENTER PARAMETERS INTO  FORTLINK MACRO STATEMENT, WHICH IS THE
***   SOLE  ACTIVE ASSEMBLER INSTRUCTION IN THIS DECK AS SUPPLIED.
***   THE PARAMETERS ARE AS FOLLOWS...
***   NSUBPG=    ...    SUPPLY DECIMAL VALUE TO SPECIFY THE NUMBER
***   OF FORTRAN SUBROUTINES/FUNCTIONS WHICH FORTLINK SHOULD HANDLE.
***   TXTSIZE=   ...   SUPPLY DECIMAL VALUE FOR SIZE OF FORTRAN
***   OBJECT PROGRAM (EXCLUDING FORTRAN LIBRARY ROUTINES) TO BE HANDLED
***   NEXTREF=   ...   SUPPLY DECIMAL VALUE FOR MAXIMUM NUMBER OF
***   EXTERNAL REFERENCES (INCLUDING FORTRAN LIBRARY CALLS)
***   TO BE HANDLED IN ANY SUBPROGRAM OR MAIN PROGRAM.
***   NREFAHD=   ...   SUPPLY  DECIMAL VALUE FOR NUMBER OF
***   'CALLS AHEAD' TO BE HANDLED IN ANY COMPLETE PROGRAM.
***   'CALLS AHEAD' MEANS CALLS TO SUBROUTINES/FUNCTIONS WHICH
***   APPEAR PHYSICALLY LATER THAN THE SAID CALLS.
***   MAP=  ...   SUPPLY OPTION FOR CORE MAP.
***   OPTIONS ARE 'NO', 'ASUSED','FULL'.
***   'NO' ELIMINATES THE MAP ALTOGETHER.
***   'ASUSED' RESTRICTS THE MAP TO USER ROUTINES PLUS THOSE
***   LIBRARY ROUTINES ACTUALLY USED.
***   'FULL' ALLOWS A COMPLETE MAP TO BE PRINTED,
***   INCLUDING ALL THE FORTRAN LIBRARY ROUTINES CONTAINED IN FASTLINK.
***   THUS A SPECIMEN  MACRO STATEMENT MIGHT APPEAR AS FOLLOWS.
***   FORTLINK  NSUBPG=15,TXTSIZE=50000,NEXTREF=30,NREFAHD=80,MAP=NO
***   THE DEFAULT VALUES ARE AS FOLLOWS .....
***   NSUBPG=20,TXTSIZE=100000,NEXTREF=50,NREFAHD=100,MAP=ASUSED
