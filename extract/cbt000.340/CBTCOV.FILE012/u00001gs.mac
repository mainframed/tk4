TSGLSORT CSECT
*
*   THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS THE USER TO EXECUTE THE STANDARD IBM SORT
*   PROGRAM WITH TWO ADDED FEATURES....
*        1     A RETURN CODE IS GIVEN TO INDICATE THAT THE SORT WAS, OR
*              WAS NOT, SUCCESSFUL.  THE RETURN CODES ARE...
*
*                 0  SORT SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED
*                 4  SORT FAILED BEFORE READING SORTIN
*                 8  SORTIN HAS NO RECORDS
*                12  SORT FAILED BEFORE WRITING SORTOUT
*                16  SORTOUT COUNT DOES NOT EQUAL SORTIN COUNT
*                20  LESS THAN 16K AVAILABLE FOR SORT
*
*        2     A 'CORE= ' PARAMETER IS AUTOMATICALLY GENERATED
*              ACCORDING TO THE CORE AVAILABLE.  THE VALUE USED IS THE
*              SIZE OF THE LARGEST FQE (BEFORE LINKING TO SORT) LESS AN
*              ARBITRARY 6K TO ALLOW FOR DATA MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONS.
*              THE RESULT MUST NOT BE LESS THAN 16K.
*
*   THE PROGRAM USES AN E15 AND E35 EXIT ROUTINE (SOURCE DECKS FOLLOW)
*   AND THE USER MUST SUPPLY A 'MODS' CARD TO TELL THE SORT TO USE THEM
*
*   BECAUSE THE EXIT ROUTINES MUST BE NAMED E15 AND E35 IF THE LINKEDIT
*   FUNCTION IS TO BE AVOIDED YOU ARE ADVISED TO PUT THIS PROGRAM AND
*   ITS EXIT ROUTINES INTO A SEPARATE PRIVATE LIBRARY TO PREVENT
*   CONFUSION WITH ANY OTHER ROUTINES HAVING THE SAME NAMES.
*
*   THE USER IS NOT ALLOWED TO PROVIDE A PARM FIELD OF HIS OWN ON THE
*   EXEC CARD, AND CANNOT USE THE 'ALTERNATIVE DDNAME' FEATURE
*   (NORMALLY AVAILABLE WHEN LINKING TO SORT).  HE CAN USE ANY EXIT
*   ROUTINES OF HIS OWN, AND CAN ADD CODE TO THE E15 AND E35 PROVIDED.
*
*   THE JCL REQUIRED IS AS FOLLOWS (EXAMPLE)...
*
*        //SORT EXEC PGM=TSGLSORT      *** SEE NOTE BELOW ***
*        //STEPLIB DD DSN=TSG.SORTLIB,DISP=SHR
*        //SYSOUT DD SYSOUT=...
*        //SORTLIB DD DSN=SYS1.SORTLIB,DISP=SHR
*        ........................................
*        //SORTIN,SORTOUT,SORTWK CARDS AS NORMAL
*        ........................................
*        //SYSIN  DD  *
*              SORT  ...NORMAL CONTROL CARD ...
*              RECORD  ...OPTIONAL - NORMAL IF USED...
*              MODS E15=(E15,160,STEPLIB,N),E35=(E35,160,STEPLIB,N)
*                  ...PLUS ADDITIONAL EXITS IF REQUIRED...
*              END
*        /*
*
*   *** NOTE *** IF YOU CHANGE THE NAME OF THIS PROGRAM YOU MUST ALSO
*   CHANGE THE LITERAL (=CL8'TSGLSORT') IN BOTH EXIT ROUTINES.
*
*   YOU MAY LINK TO TSGLSORT - NO PARAMETERS ARE REQUIRED.
*
*   YOU MAY OMIT THE MODS CARD - THIS WILL GIVE YOU THE AUTOMATIC
*   CALCULATION OF 'CORE= ', AND WILL EXECUTE SORT NORMALLY, BUT WILL
*   ALWAYS GIVE A RETURN CODE OF 4 (TO BE IGNORED).
