)O OPERANDS
))DATASETNAME/DSNAME('DATASETNAME') - THE NAME OF THE DATASET FOLLOWING
        TSO RULES.
))USERID('USERID') - VALID ONLY FOR QUEUE AND TRACE
        QUEUE - LIST ALL REQUESTS QUEUED BY THIS USER OR DATASETS WITH
                THIS USERID AS THE HIGH LEVEL QUALIFIER.
        TRACE - LIST ALL DATASETS ARCHIVED BY THIS USER OR WITH THIS
                USERID AS HIGH LEVEL QUALIFIER.
))ALL - (OPERATIONS STAFF ONLY) LIST THE WHOLE ARCHIVE/RETURN QUEUE.
        MUST BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH QUEUE KEYWORD.
))SAVE - QUEUE THE DATASET FOR ARCHIVING
         RULES FOR SAVE AUTHORITY:
           THE USER MUST HAVE RACF READ ACCESS TO THE DATASET.
))SCRATCH - DELETE THE REQUEST FROM THE QUEUE
))QUEUE - INSPECT THE QUEUE
))TRACE - INSPECT THE TRACE FILE
))RETURN('NEW DATASETNAME') - QUEUE THE DATA SET FOR RETURNING FROM
        TAPE.IF NO 'NEW DATASETNAME' IS ENTERED THE DATASET IS RETURNED
        WITH ITS OLD NAME.IF A 'NEW DATASETNAME' IS ENTERED THE DATASET
        IS RETURNED WITH THIS NAME.
        RULES FOR RETURN AUTHORITY:
           A) OPERATIONS ATTRIBUTE (OPERATIONS STAFF ONLY)

           B) THE HIGH LEVEL QUALIFIER OF THE DATASET ARCHIVED
              MATCHES THE CURRENT USERID.
           C) THE CURRENT USER ARCHIVED THE DATASET.

           D) THE DATASET IS BEING RETURNED TO THE CURRENT USERS
              DIRECTORY
           E) THE DATASET BEING RETURNED TO ALREADY EXISTS AND THE
              CURRENT USER HAS RACF ALTER ACCESS TO IT.

           THE REQUIRED RULES ARE:- A OR ((B OR C) AND (D OR E))
))VOLUME('VOLSER') -SAVE - VOLUME ON WHICH DATASET EXISTS.ONLY REQUIRED
         FOR NON-CATALOGED DATASETS.
                    RETURN - VOLUME TO WHICH DATASET IS TO BE RETURNED
         BEWARE: THE VOLUME MUST BE OF THE SAME TYPE AS IT WAS AT THE
         TIME IT WAS ARCHIVED.
))ARCDATE('DATE') - USED WITH RETURN AND TRACE TO SPECIFY WHICH VERSION
         OF THE DATASET IS REQUIRED.  THE DEFAULT WITH RETURN IS THE
         LATEST VERSION ARCHIVED, AND WITH TRACE IS TO LIST ALL VERSIONS
         THE DATE IS SPECIFIED IN YY.DDD FORMAT.
         THE KEYWORD IS IGNORED WITH SAVE OR QUEUE REQUESTS.
))KEY('KEY') - KEY TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH ARCHIVE REQUEST.MAY BE UP TO
         EIGHT CHARACTERS THE FIRST OF WHICH MUST BE ALPHANUMERIC.
         CAN ALSO BE USED WITH THE TRACE KEYWORD TO REQUEST A LISTING
         OF ONLY THOSE DATASETS ARCHIVED WITH A PARTICULAR KEY.
))FULL - REQUEST FULL TRACE INFORMATION FOR A DATASET (E.G. TAPE INFOR-
         MATION). MUST BE USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH TRACE OR QUEUE
         KEYWORDS.
