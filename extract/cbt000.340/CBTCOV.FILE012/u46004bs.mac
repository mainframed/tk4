FUNCTION DESCRIPTION
THIS PROGRAM MODIFIES UCBS IN SUCH A WAY THAT THE ASSOCIATED DEVICE IS
NO LONGER AVAILABLE FOR ALLOCATION. THIS PREVENTS THE SYSTEM ATTEMPTING
TO ALLOCATE NON-EXISTENT DEVICES OR DEVICES NOT CURRENTLY SERVICEABLE,
AND FROM ISSUING LENGTHY ALLOCATION RECOVERY MESSAGES. THE PROCESS CAN
ALSO BE REVERSED.
JCL REQUIREMENTS
DDRDR1R   DD   PARAMETERS DEFINING A CARD-IMAGE FILE.
CONTROL CARD FORMAT

THE CONTROL CARD INFORMATION CAN BE STARTED IN ANY COLUMN AND CONSISTS
OF A VERB, FOLLOWED BY AT LEAST ONE BLANK, AND THEN A LIST OF DEVICE
ADDRESSES, IN ASCENDING SEQUENCE, SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER BY A COMMA.
THE VERBS ARE:
               DEACT  -  TO DEACTIVATE A UCB
               REACT  -  TO REACTIVATE A UCB
THERE IS NO LIMIT TO THE NUMBER OF CARDS WHICH MAY BE SUBMITTED IN ANY
RUN.
ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
A DEVICE CAN BE DEACTIVATED ONLY IF IT IS OFF LINE.  IT WILL BE MARKED
ONLINE, PERMANENTLY RESIDENT, ALLOCATED; TAPE AND D.A. DEVICES WILL HAVE
A VOLUME SERIAL NUMBER OF THE FORMAT DUMCUU INSERTED INTO THE UCB, WHERE
CUU IS THE DEVICE ADDRESS.
A DEVICE CAN BE REACTIVATED ONLY IF THE UCB FLAGS AND VOLUME SERIAL
NUMBER, IF ANY, ARE SUCH AS COULD HAVE BEEN CREATED BY A DEACT FUNCTION.
THE UCB WILL BE MARKED ONLINE ONLY, AND IF THE DEVICE IS TAPE OR D.A.
THE VOLUME SERIAL NUMBER WILL BE CLEARED TO BINARY ZEROS.
THIS PROGRAM MUST RUN UNDER PROTECT KEY ZERO, AND MUST THEREFORE BE
STARTED FROM THE CONSOLE.
WARNING
IF AN OFFLINE, PERMANENTLY RESIDENT DEVICE IS DEACTIVATED AND
THEN REACTIVATED, IT WILL NO LONGER BE MARKED PERMANENTLY
RESIDENT.
