    THESE MODULES, WHEN LINK-EDITED TOGETHER, CONSTITUTE
A DIRECT REPLACEMENT FOR THE IBM BLOCK CHARACTER MODULE-
IEFSD095.
    THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THIS PROGRAM WILL HANDLE -

  LETTERS   A - Z,
  NUMBERS   0 - 9,
  ALL SPECIAL CHARACTERS AND LOWERCASE LETTERS.

    THE LATTER ARE FORMED BY USING THE UPPERCASE LETTER,
HOWEVER THE INPUT MUST BE IN LOWERCASE.

    THE PROGRAM IS RE-ENTRANT.

    THE CALLING SEQUENCE IS THE SAME AS SHOWN IN THE
PLANNING AND USE GUIDE UNDER OUTPUT SEPARATORS.
(I.E. IS IDENTICAL TO IEFSD095).
