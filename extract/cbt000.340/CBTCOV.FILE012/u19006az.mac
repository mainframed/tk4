         IN A MIXED 3420/2400 ENVIROMENT,PROBLEMS CAN OCCUR BECAUSE
         TAPE DATASETS CREATED ON A 3420 ARE CATALOGUED AS 3420 WHICH
         DOES NOT ALLOW THE TAPE TO BE READ ON A 2400 IF THE DENSITY
         CAPABILITIES ARE NOT COMPATABLE.
         ------------
         CODING IN THE TERMINATION ROUTINE WHICH ISSUES THE CATALOG
         MACRO IS AMENDED TO TEST FOR 3420, IF +VE - CHANGE TO 2400.

         NB.  THE CODE FOR 3400 DUAL DENSITY RTNE. IS OVERWRITTEN AS
         ---  THIS IS NOT REQUIRED IN OUR SYSTEM.
