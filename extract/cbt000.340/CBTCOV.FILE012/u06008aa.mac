DELINK0 - MAKE OBJECT DECK FROM A LOAD MODULE - USEFULL WHEN A PATCH ARE
          NEEDED.
THIS ROUTINE IS CAPABLE OF EXPANDING THE SIZE OF A LOAD MODULE TO CREATE
TEMPORARY PATCH AREA AND BUILD A NORMAL CSECT FROM A NON-EDITABLE LOAD M
THIS MODULE BE EITHER RE-LINKEDITED TO PRODUCE A NEW LOAD MODULE,OR EXEC
DIRECTLY USING THE LOADER.
THE MAXIMUM LENGTH WHICH CAN BE ADDED TO A CSECT IS 32767 BYTES,BUT LENG
GREATER THAN THIS CAN BE ADDED BY REPEATED USE OF THE MODULE.
THIS VERSION CANNOT PROCESS MODULES WITH PSEUDO-REG(PR) TYPE ADCONS.THE
CAPACITIES ARE 6RLD RECORDS OF 256 BYTES EACH PER TEXT RECORD AND THE MI
NUMBER OF ESD'S PER LOAD MODULE ALLOWED FOR IS 200 BUT THE ACTUAL NUMBER
VARIABLE.
THE CONTROL STATEMENTS NEEDED VIA SYSIN TAKE THE FORM:
     CC1:> MEMBER-NAME CSECT-NAME NEW SIZE
WHERE:-> IS OPTIONAL,BUT,IF PRESENT,MEANS THE SIZE OF THE CSECT IS TO BE
         INCREASED
       MEMBER-NAME IS THE NAME OF THE LOAD MODULE WITHIN THE DATA SET DE
         IN SYSLIB(DESCRIBED LATER)
       CSECT-NAME IS OPTIONAL UNLESS > APPEARS IN CC1.IT IDENTIFIES THE
         WITHIN THE LOAD MODULE PREVIOUSLY SPECIFIED TO BE CONVERTED INT
         OBJECT MODULE AND PRODUCED ON SYSPUNCH.IF IT IS OMITTED THE NAM
         SPECIFIED BY MEMBER-NAME IS USED.
       NEW SIZE IS OPTIONAL BUT MUST APPEAR IF > APPEARS IN CC1.SIZE CAN
         SPECIFIED IN:DECIMAL(1-8 CHARS)
                      HEX(1-6 CHARS,ENCLOSED IN X' ')
         AND IT REPRESENTS THE TOTAL SIZE OF CSECT TO BE PRODUCED(MUST B
         GREATER THAN ORIGINAL SIZE).
THE JCL REQUIRED IS :
          // EXEC PGM=DELINK0
          //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=A
          //SYSLIB DD DSN=NNN,DISP=SHR  NNN IS THE LIBRARY NAME
          //SYSPUNCH DD SYSOUT=B
          //SYSIN DD *
