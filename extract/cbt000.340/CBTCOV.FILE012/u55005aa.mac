    THIS PROGRAM WILL LIST THE VTOC OF ANY NUMBER OF PACKS IN THE
  SAME FORMAT AS FLASH. IT WILL ALSO OPTIONALLY LIST THE MEMBERS
  AND ALIASES OF ALL PDS'S ON THE PACKS.

 SAMPLE JCL -

  //  EXEC PGM=FLICKER,PARM=XXXXX
  //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=A
  //DDANY DD UNIT=SYSDA,DISP=SHR,VOL=SER=VVVVVV

  AS MANY DD CARDS AS REQUIRED CAN BE INPUT.

  IF PARM=NOPDS IS CODED THEN THE PDS LIST IS SUPPRESSED.


    MODULE U55005DS IS A FASTER IN-CORE SORT THAN U55003AS
  WHICH USES THE 'SHELL' ALGORITHM. IT NEEDS NO ADDITIONAL
  STORAGE BUT DOES NOT LEAVE RECORDS WITH EQUAL KEYS IN THE
  SAME ORDER. THE CALLING SEQUENCE IS THE SAME AS FOR U55003AS.
