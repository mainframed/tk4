    THIS IS A RATHER SLOW IN-CORE SORT, HOWEVER, IT NEEDS
NO EXTRA STORAGE AND LEAVES RECORDS WITH EQUAL KEYS IN THE
SAME ORDER AS THEY WERE INPUT.

    THE PROGRAM WILL SORT A TABLE IN CORE IN EITHER ASCENDING
OR DESCENDING ORDER USING A SINGLE SORT KEY. IT IS AKIN TO A
BUBBLE SORT.

    TWO PARAMETERS ARE PASSED TO THE PROGRAM -

 1. THE ADDRESS OF THE IN-CORE TABLE.
 2. THE ADDRESS OF THE CONTROL WORDS.

    THE CONTROL WORDS CONSIST OF 4 FULLWORD BINARY NUMBERS AND A SWITCH-

 1. NUMBER OF ENTRIES IN THE TABLE.
 2. LENGTH OF EACH ENTRY.
 3. LENGTH OF KEY.
 4. START POSITION OF KEY WITHIN RECORD (1ST = 1)
 5. SWITCH = CHARACTER  'A' OR 'D' FOR ASCENDING OR DESCENDING SORT.
