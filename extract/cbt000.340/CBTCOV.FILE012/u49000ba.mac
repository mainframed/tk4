FUNCTION;
 1) COPY ONE TAPE VOLUME TO ANOTHER, REGARDLESS OF LABELS.
TW0 TAPEMARKS IN SUCCESSION ARE REGARDED AS END OF VOLUME.

 2) PRINT ESSENTIAL DETAILS OF EACH FILE ON THE INPUT TAPE.
THE NUMBER OF BLOCKS, MINIMUM BLOCKSIZE AND MAXIMUM BLOCKSIZE
ENCOUNTERED ON EACH FILE IS PRINTED. IN ADDITION, IF  THE TAPE
HAS STANDARD LABELS, THE HEADER, TRAILER AND ANY USER LABELS
ARE FORMATTED AND PRINTED OUT.

USE;
  1) EXEC PARM :
     IF YOU ARE COPYING A STANDARD LABELLED TAPE, YOU MAY WANT
THE COPY TO HAVE A DIFFERENT VOLUME SERIAL NUMBER FROM THAT OF
THE INPUT TAPE. IF SO, INSERT THE VOLUME SERIAL AS THE PARM.

  2) DD CARDS :
  SYSPRINT    :  PRINTED OUTPUT.
CODED AS      : SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=A
  SYSUT1      :  INPUT TAPE.
CODED AS      : //SYSUT1   DD UNIT=(TAPE9,,DEFER),DISP=OLD,
                //            VOL=SER=??????,DCB=DEN=?
  SYSUT2      :  OUTPUT TAPE. MAY BE DUMMY IF ONLY DETAILS OF
                 THE INPUT TAPE ARE REQUIRED.
CODED AS      : //SYSUT2   DD UNIT=(TAPE9,,DEFER),DISP=(,KEEP),
                //            VOL=SER=??????,DCB=DEN=?


  THE PROGRAM ASSUMES THAT THE MAXIMUM BLOCKSIZE ON THE TAPES IS
NOT GREATER THAN 10,000. IF YOU SUSPECT THAT THERE MAY BE BLOCKS
LARGER THAN THAT, THE DCB PARAMETER ON BOTH SYSUT1 AND SYSUT2 DD
CARDS SHOULD SPECIFY A LARGER BLOCKSIZE. THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN
DESIGNED TO RUN IN 90K AND FORCES BUFNO=1 IF THIS HAS NOT BEEN
SPECIFIED IN THE DD CARD AND THE BLOCKSIZE IS GREATER THAN
19,000.
 N.B. :   THERE IS NO CHECK ON THE OUTPUT TAPE. ANY LABELS, DATA
ETC., ON THE OUTPUT TAPE WILL BE DISREGARDED AND OVER-WRITTEN.
