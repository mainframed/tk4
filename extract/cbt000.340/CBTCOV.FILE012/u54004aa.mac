                             --------
     UTILITY PROGRAM FOR ACCESSING IEBUPDTE FORMAT PDS.

     THIS PROGRAM WAS DEVELOPED SPECIFICALLY TO ACCESS SYS1.PROCLIB IN T
SAME WAY THAT WE COULD ACCESS OUR PROGRAM SOURCE LIBRARIES UNDER LIBRARI
IT WILL WORK ON ALL SOURCE LIBRARIES, AND ALSO ON LOAD AND OBJECT
LIBRARIES. PLEASE NOTE THAT UNPREDICTABLE RESULTS MAY OCCUR WHEN ACCESSI
LOAD LIBRARIES.
     THIS PROGRAM MAY BE USED FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES:-
 1) PRINTING ALL MEMBERS, OR SELECTED MEMBERS.
 2) PUNCHING ALL MEMBERS, OR SELECTED MEMBERS.
 3) SCANNING ALL OR SELECTED MEMBERS BY SPECIFIED CHARACTER STRINGS.
 4) EDITING ALL OR SELECTED MEMBERS BY SPECIFIED CHARACTER STRINGS.

     THE BASIC JCL IS AS FOLLOWS:-
 //  EXEC PGM=RSPROCUT,TIME=DDDD
 //SYSLIB DD DSN=SYS1.PROCLIB,DISP=***
 //MEMPRINT DD SYSOUT=-,(SPACE=SPACE) SPECIFY MULTI-PART AS APPROPRIATE
 //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=       )
 //SYSPUNCH DD               ) ) THESE STATEMENTS ARE OPTIONAL, BUT
 //SYSUDUMP DD               ) )  REQUIRED FOR SPECIFIC FUNCTIONS, AS
 //SYSIN DD *                )      INDICATED BELOW.

     THE DISPOSITION OF SYSLIB SHOULD BE SPECIFIED AS OLD FOR ANY EDITIN
OPERATION. AN UP-TO-DATE SECURITY DUMP OF SYS1.PROCLIB SHOULD BE AVAILAB
IN CASE OF CATASTROPHIC ERROR. FOR ANY NON-EDIT OPERATION, THE SYSLIB
DISPOSITION MAY BE SHR.

     THE EDIT OPERATION UPDATES SYS1.PROCLIB IN PLACE. IF ANY ERROR OCCU
ONLY THE MEMBER CURRENTLY BEING PROCESSED SHOULD BE AFFECTED. THE
DIRECTORY SHOULD NEVER BE UPDATED.

     THE PROGRAM RUNS IN 34K, WITH DEFAULT BUFFERING. SEE EXAMPLES FOR
INFORMATION ON BUFFER SIZES AFFECTING PARTITION SIZE.

     DO NOT USE DSO FOR MEMPRINT UNLESS SYSPRINT IS A DIFFERENT SYSOUT
CLASS.

EXAMPLES.
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
 A) PRINT ALL MEMBERS.                                         *********
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
   //  EXEC PGM=RSPROCUT,TIME=1439
   //SYSLIB DD DSN=SYS1.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR
   //MEMPRINT DD SYSOUT= ,SPACE=(TRK,(  ))  SPECIFY MULTI-PART

 NOTES. MEMPRINT DCB MAY SPECIFY A BLOCKSIZE WHICH IS A MULTIPLE OF 133.
        SPECIFY MULTIPART STATIONERY IF REQUIRED. DIRECT PRINTING MAY BE
        ADVISABLE FOR LARGE LIBRARIES.

 B) PRINT SELECTED MEMBERS.                                    *********
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
   //  EXEC PGM=RSPROCUT,TIME=1439
   //SYSLIB DD DSN=SYS1.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR
   //MEMPRINT DD SYSOUT= ,SPACE=(TRK,(  ))  SPECIFY MULTI-PART
   //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=
   //SYSIN DD *
   INCLUDE MEMNAME,MEMNAME,MEMNAME,MEMNAME
   MEMNAME,MEMNAME
 OR
   EXCLUDE MEMNAME,MEMNAME,MEMNAME,MEMNAME,
   MEMNAME,MEMNAME

 NOTES. MEMPRINT AND SYSPRINT DCBS MAY SPECIFY BLOCKSIZES WHICH ARE
        MULTIPLES OF 133. ADD 2 X BLKSIZE TO PARTITION SIZE FOR EACH FIL
        EITHER INCLUDE OR EXCLUDE MAY BE SPECIFIED BUT NOT BOTH.
        THE FORMATS OF THE INCLUDE AND EXCLUDE STATEMENTS AND CONTINUATI
        MUST BE AS SHOWN. ESPECIALLY, THE LAST MEMBER NAME ON EACH CARD
        CAN BE FOLLOWED BY A SPACE OR A COMMA, UNLESS IT ENDS IN COL 80.
        SUBSEQUENT CARDS ALSO START IN COL 1, AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE SAM
        RULE.
        MEMBER NAMES MAY BE SPECIFIED IN ANY ORDER, AND YOU ARE UNLIKELY
        EVER TO REACH THE LIMIT ON NUMBER OF NAMES.

 C) SCAN ALL MEMBERS FOR SPECIFIED CHARACTER STRINGS.          *********
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
   //  EXEC PGM=RSPROCUT,TIME=1439
   //SYSLIB DD DSN=SYS1.PROCLIB,DISP=SHR
   //MEMPRINT DD DUMMY
              OR SYSOUT= ,SPACE=(TRK,(  ))
   //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=
   //SYSIN DD *
         SCAN CONTROL STATEMENTS  (SEE FORMAT BELOW)
   /*

    SCAN CONTROL STATEMENTS, START IN COL 1, AS FOLLOWS:-
   :SEARCHSTRING::    DELIMITER IS A COLON.
                      SEARCHSTRING MAY BE ANY STRING OF EBCDIC CHARACTER
                      EXCEPT THE COLON.(X '7A',PUNCH 2-8)

    UP TO 10 SCAN STATEMENTS MAY BE SPECIFIED, EACH OF COURSE BEING ON A
SEPARATE CARD. TAKE CARE TO MAKE SEARCHSTRING AS UNIQUE AS POSSIBLE;
E.G. A SEARCHSTRING OF :3330:: WOULD BE SATISFIED BY BOTH UNIT=3330 AND
PGM=SAM3330, WHEREAS :=3330:: OR EVEN :UNIT=3330:: WOULD BE UNIQUE.

 NOTES. MEMPRINT AND SYSPRINT AS IN EXAMPLE B) NOTES.
        IF DUMMY IS NOT SPECIFIED FOR MEMPRINT, A FULL PRINT OF ALL
        MEMBERS IS PRODUCED WITH THE SCAN.

 D) SCAN SELECTED MEMBERS FOR SPECIFIED CHARACTER STRINGS      *********
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

    AS EXAMPLE C), WITH INCLUDE OR EXCLUDE CARDS  FOLLOWING  THE LAST SC
CONTROL STATEMENT. SEE EXAMPLE B OR C NOTES.
    ONLY SELECTED MEMBERS WILL PRINT TO MEMPRINT, WHICH MAY BE SPECIFIED
AS DUMMY IF A FULL PRINT IS NOT REQUIRED.

 E) EDITING ALL MEMBERS                                        *********
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *
   //  EXEC PGM=RSPROCUT,TIME=1439
   //SYSLIB DD DSN=SYS1.PROCLIB,DISP=OLD
   //MEMPRINT DD SYSOUT= ,SPACE=(TRK,(  ))  SPECIFY MULTIPART
   //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=
   //SYSPUNCH DD UNIT=00D  *OR UNIT=TAPE9 ETC
   //SYSIN DD *
         EDIT CONTROL STATEMENTS  (SEE FORMAT BELOW)
   /*

    EDIT CONTROL STATEMENTS START IN COL 1, AS FOLLOWS:-
   :SEARCHSTRING:REPLACESTRING:    DELIMITER IS A COLON.
                    THE TWO STRINGS MAY BE OF ANY EBCDIC CHARACTERS EXCE
                    THE COLON (X '7A',PUNCH 2-8)

     ALL OCCURRENCES OF SEARCHSTRING WILL BE REPLACED BY REPLACESTRING,
SURROUNDING DATA BEING JUSTIFIED AS NECESSARY; UNLESS SUCH REPLACEMENT
WOULD CAUSE DATA TO OVERFLOW BEYOND COL 71. SINCE UPDATES ARE DONE IN
PLACE, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO GENERATE NEW CARDS IN THE LIBRARY, SO CLEAR
INFORMATION IS GIVEN THAT A MANUAL UPDATE IS REQUIRED. THIS SHOULD NOT
HAPPEN FREQUENTLY.
     UP TO 10 EDIT CONTROL STATEMENTS, EACH ON A SEPARATE CARD, MAY BE
ENTERED. EACH APPLICABLE EDIT IS COMPLETED ON A STATEMENT BEFORE THE NEX
EDIT IS STARTED.
     SEARCHSTRINGS SHOULD BE MADE AS UNIQUE AS POSSIBLE AS INDICATED IN
EXAMPLE C DESCRIPTION.
     MEMPRINT SHOULD NOT BE DUMMIED OFF DURING EDITS. (SEE ABEND CODES).
IF A FULL PRINTOUT IS NOT REQUIRED, INCLUDE OR EXCLUDE CARDS SHOULD BE
SPECIFIED.(SEE EXAMPLE F).
     SYSPUNCH SHOULD NOT BE DUMMIED OFF DURING EDITS. (SEE ABEND CODES).
IT WILL CONTAIN THE CARD DECKS OF ALL MEMBERS EDITED, WHETHER SUCCESSFUL
OR REQUIRING FURTHER MANUAL UPDATING. A HEADER CARD WITH THE MEMBER NAME
PRECEDES EACH SET OF DATA CARDS. THIS FILE COULD BE BLOCKED TO TAPE AND
LATER DEBE'D TO CARDS. A VALUE EQUAL TO 2 X BLOCKSIZE SHOULD BE ADDED TO
PARTITION SIZE, IF THE DCB BLOCKSIZE IS SPECIFIED.

 F) EDITING SELECTED MEMBERS.                                  *********
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

    AS EXAMPLE E), WITH INCLUDE OR EXCLUDE CARDS  FOLLOWING  THE LAST ED
CONTROL STATEMENT. SEE EXAMPLE B) NOTES.

 G) SCAN AND EDIT TOGETHER, ON ALL OR SELECTED MEMBERS         *********
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

    AS EXAMPLES E) OR F), ALL EDITS BEING COMPLETED ON EACH STATEMENT
BEFORE THE SCANS ARE DONE.
    A TOTAL OF 10 EDIT AND SCAN CONTROL STATEMENTS IS ALLOWED.

 H) PUNCHING ALL OR SELECTED MEMBERS.                          *********
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

    NO SPECIFIC FACILITY EXISTS FOR DOING THIS, BUT IT CAN BE ACHIEVED
WITH SOME IMAGINATION BY USING EXAMPLE E) OR F) WITH AN EDIT STATEMENT O
FOR EXAMPLE;
            :/:/:  (COLON,SLASH,COLON,SLASH,COLON)
FOR MEMBERS WITH JCL STATEMENTS, OR
            :A:A:   )
            :E:E:   ) FOR ALL MEMBERS INCLUDING NON-JCL STATEMENTS
            :/:/:   )
