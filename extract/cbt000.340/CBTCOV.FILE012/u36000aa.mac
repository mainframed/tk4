THIS PROGRAM COPIES THE CATALOG 8-10 TIMES FASTER THAN THE IEHMOVE 'COPY
CATALOG' FACILITY.THIS IS BECAUSE IT COPIES WHOLE BLOCKS INSTEAD OF CATA
EACH INDIVIDUAL ENTRY IN THE NEW CATALOG.THUS IT WILL NOT MERGE ENTRIES
ANOTHER CATALOG AND IT DOES NOT COPY DUMMY DSCBS
THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THE PROGRAM IS TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE OF THE IMPROVE
CATALOG SEARCH ROUTINE USED FROM 19.0 ONWARDS.THIS SEARCHES EACH INDEX B
SINGLE 'SEARCH KEY HIGH OR EQUAL' CCW INSTEAD OF THE OLD PROCEDURE OF RE
BLOCKS ONE AT A TIME USING THE INDEX FIELD UNTIL THE BLOCK CONTAINING TH
DESIRED ENTRY IS FOUND.
THE NEW TECHNIQUE FAILS AS SOON AS CHANGES TO THE CATALOG CAUSE THE BLOC
ONE INDEX TO BE AT NON-CONSECUTIVE DISK ADDRESSES,AND THIS WILL HAPPEN F
MOST PART AS SOON AS THE CATALOG IS PUT INTO NORMAL USE.
THE PROGRAM REORGANISES THE CATALOG SO THAT EACH INDEX OR SUB-INDEX FORM
CONSECUTIVE SET OF BLOCKS WITH CORRECT KEYS.
THE NEWCAT JCL STATEMENT HAS TWO SYMBOLIC PARAMETERS:&VOL AND &CYL.
&VOL IS THE VOLUME SERIAL NUMBER OF THE DISK WHERE THE CATALOG IS BEING
&CYL IS THE SPACE ALLOCATION FOR THE NEW CATALOG.
