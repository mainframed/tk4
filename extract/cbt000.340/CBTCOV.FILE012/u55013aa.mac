    THIS PROGRAM COPIES AN SMF FILE IN VB OR VBS FORMAT.
    IT READS THE FILE AS UNBLOCKED RECFM=U RECORDS AND DOES ITS
  OWN UNSPANNING. IF AN INVALIDLY SPANNED RECORD IS FOUND, THE
  INCORRECT SEGMENT IS CHANGED TO A COMPLETE RECORD AND THE SMF
  RECORD TYPE IS CHANGED TO 255 (UNUSED IN OUR INSTALLATION).
    A REPORT IS PRODUCED SHOWING THE NUMBER OF EACH TYPE OF
  RECORD READ AND WRITTEN.

    IF PARM=SORT IS CODED THEN THE INPUT FILE IS SORTED AND ANY
  DUPLICATE RECORDS ARE REMOVED.
    OPTIONALLY PARM='SORT=XXXXXX' CAN BE CODED WHICH PASSES A
  CORE SIZE OF XXXXXX TO THE SORT PROGRAM

    J.C.L. REQUIRED -

  //   EXEC PGM=SMFCOPY
  //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=A
  //SYSUT1 DD       PARAMETERS FOR INPUT FILE (RECFM=U)
  //SYSUT2 DD       PARAMETERS FOR OUTPUT FILE (RECFM=VB OR VBS OR V)
IF PARM=SORT IS CODED THE FOLLOWING DD CARDS ARE ALSO NEEDED -


  //SORTLIB DD DSN=SYS1.SORTLIB,DISP=SHR
  //SYSOUT DD SYSOUT=A
  //SORTWK01 DD UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(CYL,5,,CONTIG)
      .
      .
      .
  //SORTWKXX DD UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(CYL,5,,CONTIG)
