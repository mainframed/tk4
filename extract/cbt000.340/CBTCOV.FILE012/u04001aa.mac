*        TRACKIT IS A UTILITY TO MONITOR DYNAMICALLY,DURING OS
*        EXECUTION,THE SIZE OF ANY OTHER PROGRAM TOGETHER WITH ITS
*        I/O BUFFERS,CONTROL BLOCKS AND SYSTEM WORK AREAS.
*
*        JCL REQUIREMENTS -
*
*             A NORMAL JOB CARD
*             //STEPNAME EXEC PGM=TRACKIT,PARM=PROGNAME,AA....A
*             //DD STATEMENTS REQUIRED BY THE PROGRAM BEING MONITORED
*             //
*
*             'PROGNAME' IS THE NAME OF THE PROGRAM TO BE MONITORED
*             'AA....A' IS ANY PARM INFORMATION REQUIRED BY THE
*              PROGRAM UNDER REVIEW
*
*        AT THE END OF A SUCCESSFUL RUN OF THE PROGRAM, THE FOLLOWING
*        STATEMENTS APPEAR AS SYSTEM MESSAGE BLOCKS.
*
*       PROGRAM......RUNNING IN......BYTES REACHED MAX OF......BYTES
*       MINIMUM TOTAL STORAGE AVAILABLE......BYTES
*       MINIMUM LARGEST AREA AVAILABLE......BYTES
*        ALL VALUES ARE IN HEXADECIMAL.
*        THE 'RUNNING IN' VALUE IS THE SIZE OF THE PARTITION LESS THE
*        SPACE TAKEN BY TRACKIT ITSELF.
*
*        IF THE MONITORED PROGRAM ABENDS, THERE WILL BE NO OUTPUT
*        FROM TRACKIT BUT THE CHANGES MADE TO THE SYSTEM BY TRACKIT
*        WILL HAVE BEEN RESTORED TO NORMAL BEFORE THE ABEND IS
*        ALLOWED TO PROCEED.
*
*        AT NORMAL TERMINATION TRACKIT PASSES BACK TO THE CONTROL
*        PROGRAM THE RETURN CODE ISSUED BY THE MONITORED PROGRAM.
*
*        ERROR MESSAGES -
*
*             ** TRACKIT - PARM FIELD ABSENT FROM EXEC STATEMENT
*
*             ** TRACKIT - ERROR IN PARM FIELD
*
*             ** TRACKIT UNABLE TO OPERATE - FLIH HAS BEEN MODIFIED
*                BY ANOTHER USER
*
*        THIS LAST MESSAGE INDICATES THAT A PROGRAM WHICH MODIFIES
*        SYSTEM ROUTINES, AND IS THEREFORE INCOMPATIBLE WITH TRACKIT,
*        IS RUNNING IN ANOTHER PARTITION.
*        IT CAN ALSO MEAN THAT A COPY OF TRACKIT IS CURRENTLY RUNNING
*        IN ANOTHER PARTITION AND A SECOND COPY CANNOT BE STARTED.
*
*        WHEN ANY OF THESE ERROR MESSAGES APPEAR TRACKIT TERMINATES
*        WITH A RETURN CODE OF 8.
*
*        IN A SYSTEM WITH SUBTASKING, TRACKIT MONITORS A PARTITION
*        AND NOT A SINGLE TASK.
*        IF A SUB-TASK ABENDS, STATISTICS COLLECTED UP TO THAT POINT
*        ARE REPORTED TOGETHER WITH THE MESSAGE -
*             TRACKIT STATISTICS INCOMPLETE - MONITORING TERMINATED
*              WHEN SUB-TASK ABENDED.
*
*        A USER TYPE 1 SVC IS REQUIRED BY TRACKIT. THIS SVC CONSISTS
*        OF ONE INSTRUCTION - AN UNCONDITIONAL BRANCH TO REG 15.
*        THE SOURCE DECK EXPECTS THIS SVC TO BE NUMBER 253.
