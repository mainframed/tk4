0       13.1  Introduction
+             ____________
0                 This macro is provided to simplify and improve the led
              of the coding required to edit a packed decimal field to a
              character field.
0       13.2  Description
+             ___________
0                 The EDIT macro generates the code to:
              - move the edit mask to the receiving field,
              - edit the source field to the receiving field.

+             ________
0           A. A 4-byte field named VALUE is edited into a field named O
0                       EDIT     OUTPUT,VALUE,'XXX0X.XXCR'
0              If VALUE contained the decimal value 30872, OUTPUT will c
               ___308.72__ .  The edit length is one byte longer than th
               specified format, since a space is used in the first posi
               the fill character.
0           B. A field addressed by register 9 is edited into an area ad
               by register 7.
0                       EDIT     0(6,R7),5(R9),'X0XXX'
0              If the source field contained the decimal value 28, after
               edit the receiving field will contain  __0028 .  Note tha
               length of the receiving field must be explicitly stated.
