    THIS PROGRAM ENABLES THE OPERATOR CONSOLE TO BE USED AS A DESK
 CALCULATOR. THE INPUT MAY ALSO BE ENTERED ON CARDS IN THE SYSIN FILE
 AND THE RESULTS OBTAINED ON SYSPRINT.

    THE PROGRAM IS SELF-DOCUMENTING BY ENTERING THE COMMAND "HELP" ON
 THE CONSOLE OR ON A CARD. THE COMMANDS "DUMP" AND "SNAP" ARE HOWEVER
 NOT DOCUMENTED AS THEY ARE ONLY DEBUGGING TOOLS.


    A LOAD MODULE VERSION OF THIS PROGRAM IS PROVIDED BECAUSE IT USES
 SUBROUTINES FROM SEVERAL DIFFERENT LANGUAGE PROCESSORS WHICH MUST BE
 LINKED WITH PROGRAM SU53CAL.


   J.C.L. REQUIREMENTS

    IF THE OPERATORS CONSOLE IS TO BE USED THEN ONLY THE
  "FT03F001" DD CARD IS REQUIRED.
