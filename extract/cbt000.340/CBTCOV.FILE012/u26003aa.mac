  SCANSGEN is a program which compares the output from two stage-1
sysgens, the object being to find jobsteps which differ or are
removed or added. One can then run these jobsteps and avoid running
steps which have not changed since the last sysgen. The output from
the program is self-explanatory but one should be aware that changes
may be detected in assembly steps but not in the subsequent linkedit
which has not changed.
  Three DD statements must be coded : -

  PRINT    -   Defines the sysout class for the report

  MASTER   -   Defines a stage-1 sysgen output that is used a basis
               for comparision, usually a previously implemented
               sysgen

  NEW      -   A new stage-1 output that is to be compared with MASTER,
               usually a new sysgen that is to be implemented.
