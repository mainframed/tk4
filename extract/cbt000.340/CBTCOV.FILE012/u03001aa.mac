*          DATE   - OCTOBER, 1972.
*
*          FUNCTION -
*                   UNDER SYSTEMS WITH SHARED DASD OPTION, THIS MODULE
*                   ISSUES A RESERVE MACRO INSTRUCTION TO ALLOW THE
*                   UPDATING OF A DATA SET ON A SHARED DEVICE, AND A
*                   DEQ TO RELEASE THE DEVICE FOR TWO-CHANNEL
*                   PROCESSING.
*
*          SAMPLE OF USE -
*                   THIS MODULE MAY BE CALLED OR EXECUTED -
*
*                        CALL SPGSHARE,(PARMLIST)           ASSEMBLER
*                        CALL 'SPGSHARE' USING PARMLIST.    COBOL
*                        EXEC PGM=SPGSHARE,PARM='PARMLIST'  JCL
*
*          PARAMETERS USED -
*                   EXPECTS THE ADDRESS OF ONE PARAMETER FIELD
*                   ARRANGED IN THE FORM OF A STRING OF POSITIONAL
*                   OPERANDS VIZ -
*
*                        FUNCTION,DDNAME,LINKNAME/OTHER PARAMETERS
*
*                   FUNCTION - THIS MUST BE THE LITERAL 'ENQ' OR 'DEQ'.
*                              ENQ ASKS FOR A VOLUME TO BE RESERVED,
*                              WHILE DEQ ASKS FOR IT TO BE RELEASED.
*                   DDNAME   - THIS DEFINES THE DATA SET TO BE UPDATED
*                              AND HENCE THE VOLUME TO BE RESERVED.
*                   LINKNAME - THIS DEFINES THE MODULE TO WHICH
*                              SPGSHARE WILL PASS CONTROL ONCE IT
*                              COMPLETES PROCESSING.  THIS OPERAND IS
*                              INTERROGATED ONLY IF SPGSHARE HAS BEEN
*                              EXECUTED.
*                   OTHER    - THESE ARE PRESENT ONLY IF THE 'LINKNAME'
*                   PARAMS     MODULE REQUIRES A PARAMETER STRING OF
*                              ITS OWN.  THEY ARE SEPARATED FROM
*                              'LINKNAME' BY A SLASH '/' AND TAKE THE
*                              FORMAT EXPECTED BY THE LINKED-TO MODULE.
*
*                   NOTE THAT, IF SPGSHARE IS CALLED, THE PARAMETER
*                   STRING MUST BE TERMINATED BY A BLANK.  THIS BLANK
*                   IS NOT REQUIRED IN EXEC MODE.
*
*                   EXAMPLES - CALL 'SPGSHARE' USING PARMS.
*
*                              WHERE -
*
*                              01 PARMINFO   PIC X(12)
*                                   VALUE 'ENQ,MASTOUT '.
*                              01 PARAMS     REDEFINES PARMINFO.
*                                   02 PARMS      PIC X(3).
*                                   02 DDNAME     PIC X(9).
*
*                              WILL RESERVE THE VOLUME ON WHICH THE
*                              DATA SET DEFINED BY MASTOUT HAS BEEN
*                              ALLOCATED. THEN -
*
*                              MOVE 'DEQ' TO PARMS.
*                              CALL 'SPGSHARE' USING PARMS.
*
*                              WILL RELEASE THE VOLUME FOR OTHER USERS
*                              AFTER UPDATING IS COMPLETE.
*
*                              EXEC PGM=SPGSHARE,
*                                    PARM='ENQ,SYSLMOD,IEWL/LIST,XREF'
*
*                              WILL RESERVE THE VOLUME ON WHICH THE
*                              SYSLMOD DATA SET IS LOCATED FOR THE
*                              DURATION OF THE JOB STEP.  AFTER
*                              SPGSHARE HAS RESERVED THE VOLUME, IT
*                              WILL LINK TO THE MODULE SPECIFIED -
*                              EG THE LINKAGE EDITOR - AND PASS IT ANY
*                              PARAMETERS AS ILLUSTRATED ABOVE.  THE
*                              JCL FOR THIS JOB STEP WILL BE THAT
*                              REQUIRED BY THE LINKED-TO PROGRAM.
*
*          RESTRICTIONS -
*                   THIS VERSION CAN HANDLE ONE RESERVE ONLY THROUGH
*                   ONE PASS - THUS SPGSHARE IN EXEC MODE IS RESTRICTED
*                   TO ONE RESERVE ONLY.  IT IS RE-USABLE IN CALL MODE
*                   FOR ANY NUMBER OF DEVICES.
*
*          LANGUAGE -
*                   ASSEMBLER.
*
*          OTHER MACROS USED -
*                   SPGCODES - INLINE ABEND CODE MACRO.
*                   ALSO USED - WAYIN, WAYOUT, GETMAIN, FREEMAIN,
*                   RESERVE, DEQ, WTO, WTOR.
*
*          ADDITIONAL REMARKS -
*                   IF THE REQUESTED DEVICE IS NON-SHAREABLE, THIS
*                   MODULE SIMPLY RETURNS CONTROL WITHOUT ISSUING A
*                   RESERVE.
*                   IF THE REQUESTED DEVICE IS UNAVAILABLE, THE
*                   OPERATOR WILL BE INFORMED VIA WTOR AND IS GIVEN
*                   THE OPPORTUNITY TO CANCEL OR RETRY.

*                   CANCEL
*
*                        ISSUED WHEN A LOCK-OUT SITUATION OCCURS - IE

*
*                   THIS MODULE MAY EASILY BE MADE RE-ENTERABLE
*                   IF REQUIRED BY CHANGING THE RESERVE, DEQ AND LINK
*                   MACROS TO LIST AND EXECUTE FORMAT AND EXPANDING THE
