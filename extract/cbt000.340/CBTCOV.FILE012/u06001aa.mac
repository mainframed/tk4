CATCH IS A PROGRAM THAT MONITORS ALL MODULES FETCHED INTO CORE.
FOR EACH MODULE FETCHED A RECORD OF THE FOLLOWING FORMAT IS GENERATED :
     BYTE    1     RECORD TYPE   HEX '00','40', OR '80'
     BYTES 2-9     MODULE NAME
     BYTE   10     LIBRARY INDICATOR  HEX '00'   PRIVATE
                                          '01'   LINKLIB
                                          '03'   SVCLIB
THESE RECORDS ARE ACCUMULATED IN ONE OR OTHER OF TWO 3300 BYTE BUFFERS.
WHEN A BUFFER IS FULL IT IS WRITTEN TO THE FILE (DDNAME=CATCHOUT).
CATCH PICKS UP THE ADDRESS OF PROGRAM FETCH FROM CVTBOSV AND SUBTRACTS H
     TO LOCATE FINCH.  IT THEN REPLACES THE FIRST THREE WORDS OF FINCH W
     BRANCH TO CATCH.
TO STOP CATCH REPLY 'NOMAN' TO AN OUTSTANDING WTOR.
AT TERMINATION CATCH RESTORES THE FINCH CODE AND GENERATES A RECORD WITH
     BYTE 1 = HEX'88' TO INDICATE END OF DATA IN THE BUFFER WHICH IT THE
     WRITES OUT.
     IT WRITES OUT A FURTHER BUFFER WITH THE FORMAT : -
          BYTE      1    HEX '99'
          BYTES  2- 5    RUN START TIME
          BYTES  6- 9    RUN END TIME
          BYTES 10-13    DATE
          BYTES 14-16    NO. LOST ENTRIES (PACKED DECIMAL)
