* OUTPUT.. IS THE MISSING DATA SET, PRECEDED BY A SINGLE PAGE OF
*  EXPLANATION. THIS EXPLANATION PAGE IS OMITTED IF THE //SYSPRINT CARD
*  IS OMITTED, BUT THE PROGRAM WILL STILL RUN.
*
*  SYSPRINT IS 121 BYTES ASA CTL CHARACTER, BLKSIZE IS NOT SPECIFIED

* THE PROGRAM ABENDS ON ANY ERROR, SO THAT CONDITIONAL DISPOSITIONS
