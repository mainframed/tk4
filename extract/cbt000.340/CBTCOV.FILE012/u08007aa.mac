1.    THIS PROGRAM ELIMINATES THE NEED FOR JCL CHAGES TO THOSE JOBS
      WHICH OUTPUT A CATALOGUED DATASET TO A SERIES OF VOLUMES IN SUCCES
      RUNS IT RESIDES ON SYS1.LINKLIB.
2.    THE JCL REQUIRED TO EXECUTE  SYVOLCH IS AS FOLLOWS
      //S1 EXEC PGM=SYVOLCH,PARM='DSN,M,N,SERN01,SERN02,.........SERNOM'
      //SYSABEND DD SYSOUT = (A,,1)
      WHERE DSN IS THE DSNAME OF THE DATA SET
           M IS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF VOLUMES IN THE CYCLES (MAX = 9)
      N IS THE NUMBER OF VOLUMES REQUIRED FOR ONE DATA SET.
           SERN0 1 ETC., ARE DISK OR TAPE VOLUME SERIAL NUMERS (I.E.'X'
3.    EXAMPLE
      _______
           RUN 1 USER.DATASET IS OUTPUT TO X1 X2
           RUN 2 IT IS OUTPUT TO X3 AND X4
           RUN 3 IT IS OUTPUT X5 AND X6
      THIS SEQUENCE IS REPEATED INDEFINITELY.
      THE APPROPRIATE JCL IS AS FOLLOWS.
           //S1 EXEC PGM=SYVOLCH,PARM='USER.DATASET,6,2,X1,X2,X3,X4,X5,X
           //SYSABEND DD SYSOUT = (A,,1)
           //S2 EXEC PGM=USERPROG,COND=(O,LT)
           //OUTPUT DD DSN=USER,DATASET,DISP=OLD
           ETC.
      SYVOLCH LOCATES THE CURRENT SET OF 'N' VOLUME SERIAL NO'S ON THE C
      AND REPLACES IT WITH THE NEXT SET IN THE PARAMETER LIST. IF THE LA
      IN THE LIST IS THE CURRENT SET, THEN IT IS REPLACED BY THE FIRST S
      THE LIST.
4.    CONDITION CODES SET BY SYVOLCH
            A) O - SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION
            B) 4 - ERROR FOUND WHEN VETTING INPUT PARAMETERS.
                   AN EXPLANATORY MESSAGE IS WRITTEN TO MSGCLASS OUTPUT
                   AS FOLLOWS
                   I)  'ERROR SYVOLCH - INPUT PARM HAS INVALID FORMAT'
                       (THERE IS INSUFFICIENT DATA IN THE PARM OR A COMM
                   IS MISSING BETWEEN SUBPARAMETERS)
               II) 'ERROR SYVOLCH - M OR N PARM LIES OUTSIDE VALID
                   RANGE'
             III)  'ERROR SYVOLCH - INVALID SERNO PARAMETER'
              IV)  'ERROR SYVOLCH - CONFLICTING INPUT PARMS'
                   (NO. OF SERNO PARMS NOT EQUAL TO M OR M/N IS NOT
                   AN INTEGER)
              V)   'ERROR SYVOLCH - INPUT PARMS AND CATALOG VCB CONFLICT
                   (NO. OF VOLUMES ON CATALOG IS NOT EQUAL TO N OR SERNO
                   ON CATALOG CANNOT BE MATCHED AGAINST INPUT SERNOS).
                   C) 8 - 36 INC - FAILURE IN THE LOCATE MACRO,
                                   PROBABLY DUE TO AN INVALID DSN
                                   PARAMETER. SUBTRACT 4 TO OBTAIN THE
                                   LOCATE CONDITION CODE AND REFER TO
                                   IBM SYSTEMS PROGRAMMER'S GUIDE.
                   D) 40 - 64 INC - FAILURE IN THE CATALOG MACRO.
                                   SUBTRACT 36 TO OBTAIN THE CATALOG
                                   CONDITION CODE AND REFER TO IBM
                                   SYSTEMS PROGRAMMER'S GUIDE
      NOTE:  IF SYVOLCH RETURNS A NON-ZERO CONDITION CODE, THE CATALOG E
             FOR THE DATA SET WILL NOT HAVE BEEN UPDATED.
5.           SINCE SYVOLCH OPERATES ON THE CATALOG ENTRY FOR A DATASET,
             IS NECESSARY FOR THAT DATA SET TO BE CATALOGUED BEFORE EXEC
             SYVOLCH FOR THE FIRST TIME.
6.    SYVOLCH TERMINATES WITH THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE.
      'END SYVOLCH - HIGHEST RETURN CODE IS XX'
