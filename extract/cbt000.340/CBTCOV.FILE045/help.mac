           ISPCMDS, the ISPF system default command table, the

           library and name it something other than ISPCMDS, eg.,
           PSICMDS.  Be sure to rename this modified command table
           back to ISPCMDS for the changes to be effective when the
           customer reinvokes the ISPF environment.

   LISTDD is a REXX EXEC that returns a list of dataset names, in a
   specified REXX variable(REXX_dsname_v), allocated to a specified
   file/ddname.  Optionally, a corresponding volume serial numler list
   may also be request to be returnned in a specified REXX
   variable(REXX_volume_v).   The number of datasets in the list is
   returnned in the constructed REXX variable(REXX_dsname_v0).

   The return code should be checked to determine the
   result of executing this function.

   Possible return codes:
     0 - successful
     4 - unsuccessful
    20 - invalid options specified / severe error

   Example1:
    Get the dsname list for ddname(SYSPROC); put the values in REXX
    variable(SPFD).

    Call LISTDD SYSPROC,SPFD
    Interpret Result;

   Example2:
    Get the dsname and associated volume serial number for
    ddname(SYSPROC); put values in REXX variables(SPFD, SPFV).
