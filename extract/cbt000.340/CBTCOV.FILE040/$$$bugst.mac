Problem in CLIST processing since PDS Version 7.0:

After any "TSO nnn" PDS subcommand is issued in a PDS CLIST, subsequent
CLIST statements operate as though they were preceded with a "TSO".

To fix this problem, apply the following source change as programmed
for PDS version 8.2:

In DSECT #MDSECT:
