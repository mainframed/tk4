Problem in VSUBCMD verification since at least PDS 8.0:

FIND and IF THEN/ELSE subcommand verification is incorrect and may
receive ABEND S0C4 since the PSCB and ECT pointers passed to VSUBCMD
are overlaid with the subcommand name.

To fix this problem, apply the following source change as programmed
for PDS version 8.2:

In module @PDSMAIN:
        CMDVER6  L     R15,=V(VSUBCMD)          VERIFY THE SUBCOMMAND
                 ICM   R1,B'1111',#ACTIONT      THEN ACTION?
                 BZ    CMDVER8                  NO, BRANCH
                 OI    FLAGSJJ,FSUBCMD          YES, SET A ESTAE FLAG
===>ADD          MVC   MSGTEXT1(16),ADDRTEXT    MOVE ARGUMENT LIST
                 ST    R1,MSGTEXT1+16           FOR VERIFICATION ROUTINE
                 ...
        CMDVER8  L     R15,=V(VSUBCMD)          VERIFY THE SUBCOMMAND
                 ICM   R1,B'1111',#ACTIONE      ELSE ACTION?
                 BZ    CALLCMD                  NO, BRANCH
                 OI    FLAGSJJ,FSUBCMD          YES, SET A ESTAE FLAG
===>ADD          MVC   MSGTEXT1(16),ADDRTEXT    MOVE ARGUMENT LIST
                 ST    R1,MSGTEXT1+16           FOR VERIFICATION ROUTINE
