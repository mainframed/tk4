   If a member name contains a%:+(colon), it is assumed to represent
   one or more members from the data set whose member names are in that
   range of names.


   Note the following examples for a data set containing members named
   A, AD, A1, A2, BA, BADZ, B2 and Z299:

+    MEMBERS%:                 +(would match all members)
+    MEMBERS%:ba               +(would match members A, AD, A1, A2, BA a
+    MEMBERS%ba:               +(would match members BA, BADZ, B2 and Z2
+    MEMBERS%a0:bc             +(would match members A1, A2, BA and BADZ
+    MEMBERS%bc:a0             +(would output an error message)
+    MEMBERS%ba:bad            +(would match members BA and BADZ)
+    MEMBERS%bb:bb             +(would match no members)
+    MEMBERS%a2345678:b2345678 +(would match members BA, BADZ and B2)
