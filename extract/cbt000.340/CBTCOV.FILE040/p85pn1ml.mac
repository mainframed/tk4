  ÖPDS+subcommands such as MEMBERS allow the use of a list of regular
   member names as well as group member names.

   Member lists are formed by placing member name specifications
   between a set of parentheses; list elements may optionally be
   separated by a comma and/or any number of blanks.


   Note the following examples for a data set containing members named
   A, AD, A1, A2, BA, BADZ, B2 and Z299:

+    MEMBERS%(a1,a2,a)        + (would match members A1, A2 and A)
+    MEMBERS%(a1, a*)         + (would match members A1, A, AD, A1 and A
+    SUBLIST%(a1, a*)         + (would match members A1, A, AD and A2)
+    MEMBERS%(ad/  b2:z)      + (would match members AD, BADZ, B2 and Z2
+    MEMBERS%(b2:z  ad/)      + (would match members B2, Z299, AD and BA
+    MEMBERS%(*,   a*1)       + (would match the default member group an
