   If a member name contains a%*+(asterisk), it is assumed to represent
   one or more members from the data set whose member names are in the
   range of names represented by the data before the asterisk and
   matching the second name segment somewhere in the remainder of the
   member name.


   Note the following examples for a data set containing members named
   A, AD, A1, A2, BA, BADZ, B2 and Z299:

+    MEMBERS%*                + (would match the default member group)
+    MEMBERS%ba*              + (would match members BA and BADZ)
+    MEMBERS%ba*z             + (would match member BADZ)
+    MEMBERS%ba*d             + (would match member BADZ)
+    MEMBERS%ba*a             + (would match no members)
+    MEMBERS%a*               + (would match members A, AD, A1 and A2)
+    MEMBERS%a2345678*b2345678+ (would output an error message -- too lo
+    MEMBERS%a234*b234        + (would match no members)
+    MEMBERS%*ad              + (would match members AD and BADZ)
