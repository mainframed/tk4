.chapter 'Modification Control and Development'
.pp
All modifications will go through the following phases during their
development.
.sp 2
.point begin
ISPF Default Values
.point 2
Enter the SRCMAINT menu and select option I.  You will now enter the
Initialization menu, select each 'all numeric' option one at a time.
When
you have selected all numeric only options then you will have
established all the required ISPF defaults for Source Maintenance.
You need only do this once to tailor and initialize all defaults.
.point
After all defaults have been established by doing the above step you
only have to use option IA to cause all of the defaults to be made
available to the ISPF panels and clists used by the source maintenance
system.  If you are using the new ISPF/PDF then this step is not
required.
.point 1
Modification Request
.point 2
All modifications will have a request written.  This request must be
approved by management prior to any coding.  The form may be found in
Appendix B.
.sk 2
.point 1
Assignment of Modid
.point 2
Enter the TRACKING panel through the SRCMAINT ISPF panel.
Select the next
MODID from the list and enter the appropriate information in the form.
.point
.rc 2 on
Note that the modid that you assign is just the first 5 positions of
the USERMOD id (i.e. SJxxx).
.rc 2 off
.sk 2
.point 1
COPY Original Source/Macro
.point 2
Enter the COPYCNTL panel and copy the original source into your
source library.
Specify COPY, the original Source/Macro library, your source library
and the SMP USERMOD id selected from the TRACKING panel.
.point
If you decide to terminate this modification then enter TRACKING and
free up the USERMOD id and then enter COPYCNTL and specify CANCEL
for the option.
.point
If you are creating a new element then use the NEW option to log
your ownership of the element name.
An assembler COPY member is to be treated as a new element.
.sk 2
.point 1
Develop Mod
.point 2
Using ISPF EDIT insert new lines of code into the copy of the original
following the coding standards found in
.ur Chapter &codechap..
.point 3
Insure that autonum is OFF.
.point
Insure that a mask is setup with the USERMOD in Columns 65-71 with
an '@' in column 64.
.point
Insure that you put in a prolog documenting the purpose of the mod, any
dependencies, messages, macros, registers, plus anything else that might
be meaningful for debugging and/or recoding of the modification for a
future release.
.sk 2
.point 1
Assemble New Module
.point 2
Enter the ASM panel of the SRCMAINT Menu and verify the object deck
library.  Also you will have to specify if you want the assembler to
verify re-entrantability of your module.  You will enter ISPF browse
of the assembly listing after the assembly and then you will be given
the option of Printing, Deleting or Keeping the listing.
.sk 2
.point 1
Link Edit New Module
.point 2
You will now want to Link the new module into a library from which it
can be tested.  See Appendix C for a list of all JES3 libraries that
can be used for testing.  Select one of the test libraries and then
enter LINKSMP panel from the SRCMAINT menu.
You many specify up to 8 individual object decks to be linkedited.
ISPF program SMPLINK is then invoked to extract the appropriate link
information from the SMPCDS and a table is built for each module and
each load module.
Only one link per load module is performed.  If you specify any new
modules that are not in the SMPCDS then the defaults as specified on
the LINKSMP panel are used.  The defaults apply to
.us all
new modules.
.sk 2
.point 1
Testing New/Changed Modules
.point 2
All new or changed modules
.us MUST
be tested under VM to insure that they work.  See the Chapter
.ur &vmchap.,
for complete documentation on testing JES3 using VM.
.sk 2
.point 1
Create SMP USERMOD
.point 2
Enter the CUMOD panel from the SRCMAINT menu.  This panel will prompt
you for the following information: module name, modid, pre-reqs,
co-reqs, allow/disallow deletion of original lines of code, plus.
.point
At this point you will be prompted to invoke AUTONUM which will place
valid sequence numbers into the new lines of code which you created
without sequence numbers (right ?).
.point 3
If you wish to have different sequence numbers for each group of new
records then place a + in column 73 and then in columns 74-77 enter
a 1 to 4 position numeric value which will be used as the increment
for that group of records.
.point 2
SMP Pre-requisites are any USERMODs which MUST be in APPLY status before
your USERMOD can be applied.
.point
SMP Co-requisites are any USERMODs which MUST be in APPLY status or MUST
be applied at the same time as your USERMOD.  If 2 or more USERMODs
require each other for processing then they are co-requisites.  If one
can be on without the other then they are either pre-requisites or
there is no SMP relationship.
.point
The USERMOD will be created by comparing the modified source with the
original source and generating an SMP USERMOD deck complete with
all required SMP information to install your modification.
.point
After CUMOD processing you are placed into browse of the CUMOD report,
if you do not have a 3278-5 terminal you should shift so that you see
columns 80-100 which contain information about CUMOD processing.
A line with --- indicates that the record in columns 1-80 was put into
the USERMOD,  if it has *** then it wasn't.
If it has ### then the record in columns 1-80 has no sequence numbers.
.point
.rc 2 on
If you created more than one element with the same modid then you will
have to run the CUMOD process multiple times, specifying the MERGE
option on the second of the CUMOD ISPF panels, until all elements have
been processed.  NOTE: that you should not specify MERGE the first
time thru CUMOD for a USERMOD.
.rc 2 off

.point 1
SMP Receive
.point 2
Enter the SMP menu from the SRCMAINT menu.  Select option 1 (Receive)
and specify the USERMOD you just created in the CUMOD phase.
.point 2
Note the Receive option, there are 4 actions that the SMP Receive Exit
will take depending upon the option specified here.  The options are
.ur in Table &smprec..
.sk 3
.tabbegin
.tabnum smprec
.fo off
.boxon
I  -  Verify that the USERMOD id is in Cols 65-71 of all
      source/macro statements.
D  -  Delete all object decks found during receive.
B  -  Both of the above options.
N  -  No checking applied - vanilla SMP actions.
.boxoff
.fo on
.table  smprec 'SMP Receive Exit Options'
.tabend
.fo on
.point 1
SMP Apply
.point 2
Enter SMP option 2 (SMP Batch) and specify option APPLY and the USERMOD
that you just received.
.sk 2
.point 1
Logging USERMOD Complete
.point 2
Enter COPYCNTL panel and specify option of Finished to log your
modification to a source/macro complete.
.point end
