.point 1
JES3 now has the ability to restrict the maximum number of DD's which
a job can have and the maximum number of DD's allowed in all CI's at
one time.
.point 2
JES3 command *I X D=CI will display these values.
.point 3
The maximum for any single job is 500.
.point
The maximum for all CI's is 1500.
.point 2
If CI gets hung and you need to start another to get a hot job thru
you can modify these values, BUT be careful since by increasing these
you expose JES3 to abend 80A's or 6FB's.
.point 3
JES3 command *F X D=CI,MAXJOBDD=xxxxx,MAXSYSDD=xxxxx will reset these
values.
.point 1
You may now repeat the last input command via PA2.
