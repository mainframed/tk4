.section 'Corrective Maintenance'
.pp
To APPLY a corrective PTF/APAR you should first RECEIVE the desired
maintenance and then use the RIBUPDTE Panel to simulate the APPLY.  All
overlays of locally modified lines of code will be flagged as will any
inserts immediately prior to a locally modified line of code.  This
CHECK is performed using the usermod id in cols 65-71 of the source
card and the @ in column 64 to signify the presence of a USERMOD.
RIBUPDTE will generate a report similiar to IEBUPDTE for each
element.
.pp
After checking the RIBUPDTE report for conflicts you should correct
the conflicts, and run the SMP APPLY.
.pp
If you have conflicts you should either attempt to restore the
USERMOD or build and APPLY a 'reverse' mod to backout the USERMOD and
then APPLY the PTF/APAR followed by the new redesigned USERMOD.

.section 'Preventive Maintenance'
.pp
To overcome some of the deficiencies of SMP in handling source the
following is a suggested technique for applying Preventive Maintenance.
.point begin
ACCEPT ALL desired PTF's and/or APARS - NOT USERMODS.
.point
Run PUTEDIT on the PUT Tapes to select only the desired FMID's.
.point
Run the output of PUTEDIT thru RIBUPDTE to flag any potential conflicts
with a local modification.
.point
Run the output of PUTEDIT thru SMP using APPLY CHECK to
flag all potential USERMOD regressions.
.point
Analyze the output of steps 3 and 4 for retrofitting of
regressed/impacted USERMODs.
.point 2
If you determine that there is no impact then
.us skip
the next step.
.point 1
Re-allocate the Target level libraries and copy the Dlib
datasets into them.
.point
Receive the PUT tape.
.point
Do an APPLY excluding those SYSMODs documented in the exclude list.
This will re-apply all usermods along with the PUT maintenance.
.point 2
.us Note:
For JES3 the exclude list should be ignored per JES3 Level 2.
.point 1
Test the new system.
.point
Copy the new level Target load libraries into the
production libraries.
.point end
