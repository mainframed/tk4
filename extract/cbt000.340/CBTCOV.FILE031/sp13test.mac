JES3 SP 1.3.1 Testing and Problem Analysis Procedures
.ur &sysdate
(final)
.sp 2
.pp
During the production test of JES3 SP 1.3.1 on WCC2, any number of
problems might occur.  As this is a potential, a list of contingency
plans have been developed and tested to assist in analyzing problems,
documenting problems and correcting problems in the most expediant
fashion.
.pp
The IPL are documented in the SP 1.3.1 Operations Procedure.
.pp
IMPORTANT: Try these procedures before you need them to insure that
you know how to use them and that you have the correct ACF2
authorization. Also insure your password is current on WCC2.
.pp
Before comming in to support operations, insure that you:
.point begin
Have a copy of the SP 1.3.1 Operator's Guide and Reference Card.
.point
Have a copy of the SP 1.3.1 Message Manual.
.point
Have a copy of the JES3 SP 1.3.1 Diagnositics Manual.

Below are documented the potential problems which can be expected
and the suggested procedure to be used if said problem occurs.
.point begin
To use ISPF on WCC2 enter EX 'AOST.CLIST(ISPF)'
.point 1
JES3 takes a DUMP.
.point 2
Logon to TSO on WCC2 and enter
EX 'AOST.CLIST(PREIPCS2)' 'NEW'. This
will allocate all required ISPF and IPCS datasets.  You will then be
in IPCS and will be able to analyze the dump.
.point
It would be a good idea to use the DUMPCOPY option to BDT the dump
to the MSS on WCC1 for safe keeping.
.point 1
Module needs replacing.
.point 2
From TSO on WCC1 update
the source for the module in error using the standard source
maintenance procedures.  Assemble and then link the module into
your load library.
.point
If NJE is available then use the BDT panel to bulk-data-transfer
the new load module to the correct load library on WCC2.
.point
If NJE is DOWN then use the ISPF copy panel to copy the load module
to JES3.TESTSP.LOAD which resides on a volume shared between WCC1 and
WCC2.  Then logon to TSO on WCC2 and use ISPF copy to copy the module
to the correct JES3.LIONEL.LOAD.
.point
.us NOTE: JES3.BETA.LOAD and AJES.BETALPA.LOAD are the libraries
.us being used for this test
.point 1
JES3 is down.
.point 2
Never happen !!!!!
.point
But if it does then mount AUJSQ0 on any available 3330 drive.
.point 3
IPL using the normal IPL parameters.
.point
Start JES3 using:   S JES3,Q=TEST
.point
Bring up JES3 and have TSO started.  Logon and take whatever
corrective action is required.
.point 2
Or IPL and bring SU26 back up normal.
.point 3
And then take whatever corrective action is required.
.point end
