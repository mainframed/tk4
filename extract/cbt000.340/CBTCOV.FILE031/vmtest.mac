VM is run in the WCC on a 370/158 AP with 6MB of storage or on a 16MB
4341M2.
It is
used to test new releases of software and to check out system
modifications prior to being placed into production.
.pp
To sign up for a VM test slot,  sign out a slot on the VM chalk
board. On the 158
there are 4 MVS id's for VM testing, however we try never to have
more than 3 MVS test systems active at any one time due to performance
considerations.
On the 4341 the only MVS id is MVS.
.pp
The datasets of most interest for VM testing are shown in
.ur Table &vm1..

     To LOGON onto VM:
        1. depress enter to clear the VM logo
        2. enter LOGON MVSx MVS

     Insure that no volumes are missing - you will get a message if
     any are.

     Issue #CP SP CONS STA to spool your console log.

     If you are using the 4341 then you must:
        a) issue #CP Q DA AUMVSF
           then issue #CP ATT xxx * 323  where xxx is the address from
           the prior query.
        b) issue #CP Q DA AUCATF
           then issue #CP ATT xxx * 324  where xxx is the address from
           the prior query.

     You are now ready to IPL MVS - to do so enter:
       #cp I 333 (323 on the 4341)

     Within a few minutes you should receive the following message:
     IEA101A SPECIFY SYSTEM PARAMETERS ...

     Your response should be similar to:
       r 00,SYSP=VM  (optionally ,CLPA)

     You can change the MLPA, Linklist, APF list, Nucleus, etc. with
     this reply.

     You will then be prompted to enter the master catalog parameter,
     depress enter unless you wish to change the master catalog.
     (The message is IEA347A SPECIFY MASTER CONSOLE)

     You will now receive a lot of IEA301I and IEA363I messages which
     can be ignored.

     You will now receive message:
     IEA877A  SPECIFY FULL DASD SYS1.DUMP DATSETS ....
     reply:
     enter
     or
     R 00,DA=(xx,yy)     where xx and yy = the full dumps you wish
                         to have emptied.

     The next prompt is IFB010D ENTER "IPL REASON, SUBSYSTEM ID" OR "U"

     Your response should be:
     R 00,U

     To save your system so that you do not have to re-IPL you can
     enter QUIESCE which will stop MVS.  You should then enter
     #CP SAVESYS MVSx.  This will save your current system for use
     the next day or the next time that VM is up.

     To bring up a saved system - log onto VM and enter I MVSx.
     Then enter #CP SYSTEM RESTART and you are back where you were.

.section 'JES3 VM Testing'

.ur NOTE: For JES3 1.3.1 Testing see Section &j3vmsec

     You are now ready to start JES3.

     To do so enter:
     S JES3,Q=VM

     Check with the JES3 group if you wish any changes to the standard
     JES3 system.

     You will receive 3 prompts for JES3 initialization.

     The first prompt is:
     IAT3011 SPECIFY JES3 START TYPE
     01 IAT3011 (L H HA W WA OR C)

     You should normally respond with C for cold start as this is the
     fastest.
     ex.  R 01,C

     The second prompt is:
     02 IAT3033 CONFIRM JES3 COLDSTART REQUEST (U)

     Reply with R 02,U

     The third prompt is for the INITDECK and is:
     03 IAT3012 SELECT JES3 INISH ORIGIN (N M= U=), ...

     The normal response is R 03,M=VM

     JES3 is now on its way to initialization.

     After some time you will receive message:
     IAT3100 JES3 x.x.x SYSTEM COLDSTART ON yy.ddd AS L

     This indicates that the coldstart has been successfully completed.

     You should now enter:
     *S JSS

     This will complete the initialization of JES3.

     You must now enter:
     *V L,ON  to vary cpu L online to JES3

     Message IAT2645 ****** L    CONNECT COMPLETE ******
     indicates that you are ready to begin processing.

     If you have any sysout be sure that all output has a DEST of LOCAL.
.cp 7
     You may receive message:
     IAT7030 jobname (job#) on WCC1#00B (00B), SETUP F=STANDARD, ..

     This indicates that JES3 wants to start writer 00B, you should
     enter:
     *S 00B to start the output writer.


.sp 3
.subsection 'JES3 Commands'

     Some common JES3 commands are:

     *I J/jobname   - inquire about a job

     *F J/job#,C    - cancel a job

     *F J/job#,p=xx - change a job's JES3 priority

     NOTE:  All JES3 commands are prefixed by an * or 8.

JEST has been established as a test proc for JES3 and requires
that MVS be IPL'd with SYSP=J3 to allow JEST to be a subsystem.
.pp
The default MLPA parameter for SYSP=J3 is MLPA=J3 and is required
for JES3 1.3.1 testing.
.pp
If you do not use the JEST procedure then you will have to start
JES3 as follows:
.pp
IPL MVS with MLPA=J3 and LNK=(00,XP or XB or XT or any combination)

.subsection 'Viewing the INITDECK Listing on VM'
.pp
When JES3 comes up it places the INITDECK listing into a disk
dataset on a minidisk.  To view the listing you need to log onto a
CMS id and execute the OSLIST or OSLISTX CMS EXEC.
.sp 2
.subsub 'OSLIST'
.sp
.pp
This EXEC will copy the INITDECK into a CMS file named
INITDECK LISTING A1 and will write the file to your terminal.
.pp
To execute OSLIST enter:
.sp
.fo off
OSLIST  xxxx          where xxxx = the MVS VM id
                                   or TEST if you used Q=TEST
.fo on
.sp
.subsub 'OSLISTX'
.sp
.pp
This EXEC will copy the INITDECK into a CMS file named
INITDECK LISTING A1 and will then put you into XEDIT to view the file.
.pp
To execute OSLISTX enter:
.sp
.fo off
OSLISTX xxxx          where xxxx = the MVS VM id
                                   or TEST if you used Q=TEST
.fo on
.pa
.section 'VM Commands'
.fo off
.sp
All VM commands should be preceded by a #CP to indicate that you
are entering a VM command and not a CMS or MVS command.

Some of the more common VM commands are:

#CP Q N  - display who is logged onto VM

#CP IND  - display current CPU utilization

#CP IND USER - display the current CPU usage for your session

#CP D P   - display the current PSW

#CP D G   - display the current general register contents

#CP SET PFxx IMM command - set a PFK with a VM or MVS command to
                           be executed immediately

#CP Q PF                 - displays current PFK settings

#CP SET PFxx command     - set a PFK with a VM or MVS command to
                           be executed after allowing modification

#CP SPOOL CONSOLE START - to spool all VM, MVS and JES3 console
                          messages to hardcopy

.section 'SAVESYS'
.pp
If you want to use the same MVS system on your next VM session and
do not need to change any IPL parameters you can save the current
MVS system intact.  You will want to reserve your VM logonid to
insure that the paging and spool packs will not be altered.
To do this :
.point begin
Issue QUIESCE  - then wait for a wait state message
.point
Issue #CP SAVESYS MVSx  - where x = your VM id (1-4)
.point
Issue #CP LOGOFF when the SAVESYS is completed
.point
Recover from a SAVESYS:
.point
Logon to VM
.point
Issue IPL MVSx - where x = your VM id
.point
You are now exactly where you were when you did the SAVESYS.
.point end
.pa
.section 'TSO under VM '
.pp
To run TSO under VM :
.point begin
Start VTAM. (See VTAM under VM)
.point
Issue S TSO
.point 2
After TSO starts, you should have the VTAM salutation on the
terminal attached as D50, to LOGON enter YAVMTSO.
.point
After TSO is up issue EX 'AOST.CLIST(VMLOGON)' to set up
the correct TSO Prefix.  See separate documentation on VMLOGON
in this document for further information.
.point
NOTE: The prefix of AVMTSO is required so that you can allocate
datasets and use ISPF plus.  The index will cause all new
allocations to go to AVDIV1 so please be careful what you
allocate.
.point
Important NOTE:  You cannot access either your TSO or RAT volumes
so if you want any of these datasets then copy them to AVDIV1 with
index AVMTSO.
