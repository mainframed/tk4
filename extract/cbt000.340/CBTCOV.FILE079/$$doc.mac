      This is the OS/MVT Release 21.8 SYS1.SAMPLIB from IBM.

      You don't have to worry about software licensing--you can use
all these members for free. At the time this material was written,
IBM was giving away all its software for free.  Therefore these
members are in the public domain.

      They are being included here for your use and enjoyment.
Please use them at your own risk.  The OS operating systems have
"changed a bit".  Good luck.
