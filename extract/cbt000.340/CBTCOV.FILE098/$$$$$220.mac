This is the NERDC Queue (for 2.2) from file 101 of the JES mods tape.
It has been updated to include the BFG mods and the BFG ISPF support.
The ISPF support now encompases ISPF 2.3.

Good Luck

NERDC Message:
----------------------------------------------

THIS IS A FIRST ATTEMPT AT QUEUE FOR JES2 2.2.0.

It is based on the Lockheed version of QUEUE for 2.1.5.

NOTE:  This code has only been tested with a JES2 system running
with MODE=DUPLEX.
It is possible that this code will work with a MODE=DUAL system,
but since this code does not do anything with the CHANGE LOG data,
and since it is only reading one of the checkpoint datasets,
it will always be working from a slightly back-level version of
the checkpoint.

-----

CHANGES MADE:

Add $HFAME macro calls to ACTIVE and INITS.

Change QSTART (for NERDC option only) to change default VOLSER.

Change INIT's code that prepares for reading the checkpoint.
 - The DAS information about what SPOOL volumes are used is now
   at the END of the checkpoint.
   Code was changed to read the entire checkpoint during INIT
   to get the DAS information.
   (It would be possible for someone to calculate the record address
   of the DAS and just read it directly, but I was in a hurry.)
   While I was there, I threw out a lot of the calculations that
   were used to determine the number of 4K blocks to read, and
   instead just use the information provided in the HCT and the
   4K blocks themselves.
