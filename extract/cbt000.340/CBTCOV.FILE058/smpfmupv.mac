       REMARKS.

           MODIFIED 04/11/86 TO ACCEPT RECFM=VBA,LRECL=137 INPUT
              RECORDS.  THESE ARE THE DIRCT OUTPUT OF THE PUTXREF
              PROGRAM.  THE RECFM CONVERSION STEP OF VBA TO FBA IS
              THUS ELIMINATED.

           WRITTEN ON 11/01/85 FOR SMP4 PUT PROCESSING.  THE PROGRAM
           PUTXREF, TAKEN FROM THE CBT SHARE TAPE, PRODUCES A REPORT
           BREAKING DOWN A PTF FILE OF PUTS BY FMID.  THIS PROGRAM
           READS THAT REPORT, AND PRODUCES A LIST OF PTFS IN IBM
           EXCLUDE LIST FORMAT, SORTED BY FMID, AND WITH CONSECUTIVE
           DUPLICATE PTFS REMOVED.  THE CONDITION LEADING TO DUPLICATE
           NAMES IS IF THERE ARE MULTIPLE VERSIONS OF THE SAME PTF FOR
           DIFFERENT FMIDS THAT IFREQ TO ITSELF.  FOR EXAMPLE, SEE
           PTFS HAVING TO DO WITH JBB1327, JBB1328, AND JBB1329
           TOGETHER (UZ39044 FOR INSTANCE).
              PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS PROGRAM IS SET UP FOR SYNCSORT.
              IT TURNS OFF WHEN IT "SEES" THE SYNCSORT REPORT.
              IF YOU HAVE IBM SORT, PLEASE MODIFY THE PROGRAM
              ACCORDINGLY, REGARDING SETTING THE FLAG TO 'E'.
