  #############################

   The purpose of this package is to produce EXECUTABLE LISTS OF SYSMODS
FROM SMP4 REPORTS.  You can plug the output of an SMP job into another
SMP job with this.   It saves a lot of copying of PTF numbers from
listings, and improves accuracy.  I HAVE INSTALLED ENTIRE PUT TAPES
WITHOUT LOOKING AT A PAPER LISTING, AND THIS IS WITH SMP/4 !!!!!!

   In this package, there are also programs to list all ELEMENTS
affected, from the element report of an APPLY or ACCEPT listing. There's
also stuff that gets PTF LISTS FROM THE RECEIVE SUMMARY, and from LISTs.
The HELDOFF program SMPHOFF producing a list of held-off and holders-off
sysmods was the first program I wrote, and is very very useful for puts.
Comments are included in the output file for most program outputs,
next to each sysmod or element number to make the outputs much more
useful.  SYSMOD NUMBERS ARE PUT IN COLUMN 7 TO MAKE THEM SORT-MERGEABLE
WITH IBM's.  Element names are put in column 2, to get the maximum
comments into the output line.

   Using these programs is easy, although there are a few tricks.  Input
is a copy of your SMP listing on a disk file (see NOTE on LRECL). Output
is a card deck:  I usually put the card deck on my PUTPDS dataset (which
gets pretty big).  I shall include my execution jcl for all of them
with the prefix @.  The idea is to sort the output and delete the
duplicate numbers.  Some of the programs deliberately produce
duplicate numbers for output.  In any case, I AM INCLUDING ALL OF MY
EXECUTION JCL as of this date.  The input ddname is SYSUT1.  You don't
have to guess what the output ddname is.  As I said, I'm including
all my execution jcl, so it shouldn't be too bad.

   As I said above, you can modify these programs or enhance them
for your needs.  Work on SMP "LIST" listings especially needs
to be done.  GOOD LUCK.  I'd appreciate calls from users.

 NOTE:  Please look in the supplied JCL for each program.  There may
          be programming errors in the code which are compensated for
          by the specific JCL which I USED IN EXECUTING THE PROGRAMS.
          I will try to fix the code in future versions.  You can fix
          it too (and you should!!).   sg - 11/05/85.

        Fixes were made on 4/13/86 eliminating VB to FB conversion
          for the programs getting input from PUTXREF program output.
          The new programs have names ending in the letter "V".
          Affected programs are SMPFMIDV and SMPFMUPV.  The old
          versions remain included in this package under their original
          names, SMPFMID and SMPFMUPD.  Please adjust your JCL.

        I became aware that standard print output from SMP has
          LRECL(121) and not LRECL(133).  I modified all the programs
          to accept LRECL(121) input for SMP reports on disk file.
          The old programs also remain included.  Source modules whose
          names end in the letter "Q" expect LRECL(121) input.
          The original programs expect report input to be LRECL(133).
          Now you have a choice as to which to use.

 NOTE:  Anybody can use this stuff.  IT WAS MEANT TO BE MODIFIED
          IF NECESSARY.  Here's one for the boys, to make life easier.
          If there are bugs, fix 'em, and let me know, if you can.
          This is not a great job of programming.  (For an application
          programmer, it's a piece of cake.)  It just does a job I
          needed doing, and I was surprised I never saw any other
          of the clever system-programmer creations which did it.
          See member $$DOCSUM for program abstracts.
          The package is written in simple COBOL.  Any version of
          COBOL compiler can probably be used.

      Source members begin with SMP.  JCL members begin with @.
      Most output examples begin with #.  ISPF statistics are now
        descriptive of the contents.  sg - 4/13/86.
