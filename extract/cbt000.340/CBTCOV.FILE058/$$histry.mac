08/20/87  -  Improved comments which SMPLIST AND SMPLISTQ obtain
               from the LIST CDS SYSMOD listing.  also LIST ACDS.

04/13/86  -  Wrote SMPFMIDV and SMPFMUPV to accept variable blocked
               input from the PUTXREF program directly without conver-
               sion.  This eliminates the need for an intermediate JCL
               step to change the "PUTXREF" output to a form acceptable
               by these useful tools.  YOU CAN NOW GET A "FORFMID"
               EFFECT FROM PUT TAPE INPUT OR PTF FILE INPUT more
               directly.

11/01/85  -  Wrote SMPFMID and SMPFMUPD, which use output from the
               PUTXREF program from file 118 of the CBT tape, and
               produce executable lists of PTFs according to FMID.
               Input is a put tape or PTF input file.  Output from
               the PUTXREF program is VB, and has to be converted
               (by DSCOPY, etc.) to FB 133 for use by the programs.

             SMPFMID PRODUCES A SINGLE LIST OF PTFS SORTED BY FMID.
               Comments at the side of each PTF mention the FMID name.

             SMPFMUPD puts a card:    ./ ADD NAME=FMIDNAM
               before the PTFs for each FMID.  Then this deck can be
               loaded into the putpds by an IEBUPDTE or PDSLOAD step,
               resulting in a lot of members whose names are FMID names.
               These members contain all the new PTFs for the PUT
               which belong to that FMID.  THIS GIVES A "FORFMID"
               FUNCTION IN SMP4, IF YOU ONLY WANT TO SELECT PTFS FROM
               A GIVEN FMID.
