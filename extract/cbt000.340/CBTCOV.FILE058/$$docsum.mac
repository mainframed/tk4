$$DOCSUM -  DOCUMENTATION SUMMARY FOR INDIVIDUAL SMPSERV PROGRAMS.


  SMPALIST   -  PRODUCES CARD-IMAGE LISTING OF ALL SELECTED SYSMODS
  SMPALISQ        FROM AN APPLY OR ACCEPT SYSMODS REPORT.  INCLUDES
                  COMMENTS - FIRST 45 OR SO COLUMNS NEXT TO SYSMOD
                  NUMBER.  SYSMOD NAME BEGINS IN COLUMN 7 LIKE IBM'S.

  SMPELMNT   -  PRODUCES CARD-IMAGE LISTING OF ALL APPLIED OR ACCEPTED
  SMPELMNQ        ELEMENTS.  THIS DOES NOT INCLUDE THEIR ALIASES,
                  BUT THE PRINCIPAL ELEMENT NAME AS FOUND IN THE APPLY
                  OR ACCEPT LISTING'S ELEMENT REPORT.

  SMPELSYS   -  SIMILAR TO SMPELMNT, BUT IT PULLS FROM THE "APPLIED"
  SMPELSYQ        FIELD INSTEAD OF FROM THE "RMID" FIELD.

× SMPFMIDV   -  GET A PTF LIST BY FMID.  USES PUTXREF PROGRAM FROM FILE
× SMPFMID         118 OF THE CBT TAPE.  THE USEFUL VERSION OF THIS
×                 PROGRAM IS SMPFMUPD.

× SMPFMUPV   -  GET A PTF LIST BY FMID FROM A PUT TAPE OR SEVERAL OF
× SMPFMUPD        THEM CONCATENATED.  THIS PGM PRODUCES IEBUPDTE ./ ADD
×                 CARDS TO LOAD PTFS FROM EACH FMID ON THE PUT TAPE
×                 INTO AN APPROPRIATELY NAMED MEMBER OF THE PUTPDS.
×                 A "FORFMID" RESULT IS THUS ACHIEVED FOR SMP4 APPLY
×                 SELECTION, BECAUSE YOU CAN PICK ALL PTFS FROM A
×                 SINGLE FMID TO APPLY.  JCL IS @SMPF AND @SMPFF.

  SMPHDEL    -  CARD-IMAGE INPUT AND CARD-IMAGE OUTPUT.
                  DELETES REPEATS OF SYSMOD NAMES.  NECESSARY TO AVOID
                  ERRORS WHEN USING THESE CARD-DECKS AS INPUT TO SMP4
                  JOBS.  YOU MUST SORT THE SYSMOD NAMES FIRST.

  SMPHOFF    -  THIS IS MY BEAUTY.  SAVES LOADS OF TIME DOING PUTS.
  SMPHOFFQ        TELLS YOU ALL PTFS WITH A * OR A - NEXT TO THEM
                  ON AN APPLY CHECK OR ACCEPT CHECK SYSMODS LISTING.
                  ALSO INCLUDES THE PTFS THEY HOLD OFF.  OUTPUT HAS
                  REPEATED NUMBERS AND MUST BE SORTED AND RUN THRU THE
                  SMPHDEL PROGRAM.  YOU CAN SORT-MERGE-DELETE-DUPLICATES
                  WITH THE ORIGINAL IBM EXCLUDE LIST AND PRODUCE AN
                  EXPANDED EXCLUDE LIST AUTOMATICALLY, TO TRY IN THE
                  NEXT APPLY CHECK.  NO MORE COPYING BIG LISTS OF PTFS
                  TO ADD TO THE EXCLUDE LIST.
                NOTE - SEE THE SOURCE LISTING TO CHECK IF YOUR PTFS
                  BEGIN WITH LETTERS OTHER THAT U,A,B,C,D,E,V.
                  MODIFY THE SOURCE AS NEEDED.

  SMPHONLY   -  SIMILAR TO SMPHOFF BUT LIST ONLY PTFS HELD OFF--NOT THE
  SMPHONLQ        HOLDERS-OFF.

  SMPHONL1   -  YOU MODIFY AND USE THIS WHEN YOU HAVE A BIG LIST OF PTFS
                  WHICH YOU WANT TO INVESTIGATE TO SEE IF THEY HOLD OFF
                  PTFS IN A BIG PUT.  THIS WAS REALLY A ONE-SHOT DEAL
                  IN OUR PLACE, BUT I'M INCLUDING IT BECAUSE SOMEBODY
                  MIGHT NEED IT.  YOU MUST MODIFY IT TO USE IT.

  SMPINCPT   -  LISTS ALL SELECTED SYSMODS WHOSE APPLY OR ACCEPT WAS
  SMPINCPQ        INCOMPLETE.  CREATES PTF LIST FOR A SELECT REAPPLY.

× SMPLIST    -  PRODUCES A LIST OF ALL PTF NUMBERS IN A LIST CDS OR
× SMPLISTQ        LIST PTS OR LIST ACDS.  COMMENT FIELDS HAVE BEEN
×                 ENHANCED.

  SMPLIST#   -  SIMILAR TO SMPLIST.  SOME PRIMITIVE PLAYING AROUND WAS
                  DONE WITH THE COMMENTS FIELD.

  SMPLSERR   -  TAKES LIST CDS LISTING AND PRODUCES OUTPUT DECK OF
  SMPLSERQ        ALL PTFS MARKED IN ERROR.  USED FOR RECOVERY.

  SMPRCALL   -  PRODUCES CARD IMAGE DECK OF ALL SYSMODS IN A RECEIVE
  SMPRCALQ        SUMMARY REPORT.

  SMPRCSUM   -  PRODUCES CARD IMAGE DECK OF ONLY SYSMODS IN A RECEIVE
  SMPRCSUQ        REPORT WHICH WERE MARKED "RECEIVED".

  SMPRECVD   -  TAKES OUTPUT FROM SMPRCALL AND PICKS OUT ONLY THOSE
                  SYSMODS MARKED "RECEIVED".  IF YOU RAN SMPRCALL
                  INSTEAD OF SMPRCSUM, THIS FIXES IT UP.
