  SMPUPD LETS YOU SEPARATE PTFS FROM A PUT TAPE WITHOUT DOING A
     RECEIVE.  A ./ ADD NAME=PTFNAME IS ADDED TO THE SMPPTFIN
     DATASET BEFORE EACH ++ PTF STATEMENT, AND ALL ./ CHARACTERS
     IN COLUMN 1 ARE CHANGED TO ><.  YOU USE PDSLOAD TO LOAD THE
     RESULTING SEQUENTIAL DATASET INTO A PDS.  SEE JOBSTREAM
     @MPUPD IN THIS DATASET FOR EXAMPLE OF USE.   NOTE THAT
     SOMETIMES IBM SENDS DUPLICATE COPIES OF A PDS.  I THEREFORE
     DO A PDS RESTORE OF DELETED MEMBERS TO MY "TARGET" PDS.  SEE
     THE JOBSTREAM EXAMPLE.


  SMPLIST AND SMPLISTQ PRODUCE A LIST OF SYSMOD NAMES (CARDIMAGE)
     FROM AN SMP "LIST CDS" OR "LIST ACDS" LISTING ON DISK.
     THE NAMES OF THE LISTED SYSMODS ARE IN COLUMN 7, TO CORRESPOND
     TO IBM'S EXCLUDE LIST FORMAT.  COMMENTS ARE ADDED TO THE RIGHT
     OF EACH SYSMOD LISTED.  THESE COME FROM THE SMP REPORT.
     SAMPLE OUTPUT IS ON THIS DATASET - MEMBER #SMPLIST.


 1.  IMPROVEMENT SUMMARY:   SMPLIST   (INPUT LRECL = 133)
                            SMPLISTQ  (INPUT LRECL = 121)

           PROGRAMS WERE CHANGED TO PUT MORE INFORMATION FROM

              LIST CDS SYSMOD   OR  LIST ACDS SYSMOD  REPORTS

           INTO THE COMMENTS AFTER THE SYSMODS IN THE SYSMOD LIST.


      NOTE.  I USE THESE PROGRAMS TO READ A LIST CDS SYSMOD SELECT( )
              JOB WHICH RUNS AGAINST MY EXCLUDE LIST AFTER APPLYING
              A PUT.  SUCH A LISTING CAN BE USED TO OBTAIN A LIST
              OF ALL SYSMODS, APPLIED ON MY SYSTEM ALREADY, WHICH
              ARE IN ERROR (PE) AND ARE NOT SUPERSEDED, AND WHICH
              DO NOT HAVE A LASTSUP ENTRY AGAINST THEM.  THESE PTFS
              ARE OK IF THEY HAVE BEEN FIXED ALREADY.  THEY ARE NOT
              OK IF THEY BECAME PE AFTER MY PREVIOUS PUT WAS APPLIED.

              SORTING THE OUTPUT OF THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS ME TO PICK
              UP THIS INFORMATION WITHIN MINUTES OF COMPLETION OF
              THE LIST CDS AGAINST MY EXCLUDE LIST.  I SORT THE
              SYSMODS AGAINST THE (NEW) FIELDS REPORTED ON IN THE
              COMMENT AREA OF THE OUTPUT DECK.
