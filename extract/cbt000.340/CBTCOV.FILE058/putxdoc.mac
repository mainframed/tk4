*        FUNCTION:                                                    *
*        THIS PROGRAM TAKES THE PUT PTF FILE (FILE 1 FROM A           *
*        STANDARD IBM PUT TAPE), AND PRODUCES A CROSS                 *
*        REFERENCE OF THE PTF'S INCLUDED, SORTED BY FMID.             *
*        IT CAN TAKE CONCATENATED INPUT, BUT THE TAPE IDENITY         *
*        ON WHICH THE PTF IS FOUND WILL BE LOST. THE PROGRAM          *
*        SHOULD BE USEFUL TO QUICKLY IDENTIFY WHAT PTF'S              *
*        ARE ON A GIVEN TAPE, WHAT FMID'S HAVE MAINTENANCE ON         *
*        A TAPE, AND TO DOUBLE CHECK THE STERLING FORREST             *
*        CROSS REFERENCE (IT LIES ONCE IN A WHILE.)                   *
*                                                                     *

*        1.    THIS PROGRAM HAS AN INVOKED INCORE SORT.               *
*              IT LINKS TO THE ENTRY POINT OF "SORT".                 *
*              CHANGE THE LINK MACRO IF YOU DO NOT SUPPORT            *
*              THAT NAME OR ALIAS. YOU WILL NEED ABOUT                *
*              300K FOR THE WHOLE PROGRAM AND SORT.                   *
*        2.    TITLES.  THIS FILE (FOR FMID TITLES) IS                *

*              WARNING MESSAGE ON YOUR SYSOUT, AND NO TITLES.         *
*              I HAVE INCLUDED THE FILE IN THE JCL, I                 *
*              CREATED THE FILE BY DOING THE FOLLOWING:               *
*              A. ALLOCATE A DATA SET ON TSO  - NORMAL STUFF -        *
*                  RECFM=FB,LRECL=80                                  *
*              B.  ASSIGN THAT DATA SET TO DD NAME OF OZPRINT         *
*              C.  EXECUTE YOUR INFO - SYS CLIST OR COMMAND           *
*              D.  ISSUE A 'DEF A' COMMAND TO INFO (SEARCH            *
