*  MODIFIED APRIL 26, '88 BY SHMUEL GOLOB OF NEWSWEEK TO ONLY       SBG
*    LOOK FOR FMID KEYWORD IF YOU'RE LEGITIMATELY WITHIN A ++VER    SBG
*    STATEMENT.  LEFT ALL THE OTHER STUFF IN AS SAFETY CHECKS.      SBG
*    PLEASE INFORM ME AT NEWSWEEK (201) 316-2328 IF THIS VERSION    SBG
*    OF THE PROGRAM FAILS TO WORK.  (CODE CAN USE CLEANING UP.)     SBG
*                                                                   SBG
*  MODIFIED APRIL 25, '88 BY SHMUEL GOLOB OF NEWSWEEK TO FIX A FEW  SBG
*    BUGS.  THE PROGRAM CAN NOW DETECT IF THE FMID KEYWORD IS IN    SBG
*    A COMMENT AREA.  IT ALSO KNOWS THAT IN THE INSIDE OF JCLIN YOU SBG
*    CAN'T TEST FOR A COMMENT AREA, AND IT WON'T TEST FOR AN FMID   SBG
*    KEYWORD THERE EITHER.  ALSO FIXED BUG THAT 1ST CHARACTER       SBG
*    OF THE FMID WAS CHOPPED OFF IF THERE WERE AN ODD NUMBER OF     SBG
*    SPACES BETWEEN THE OPEN PAREN AFTER THE FMID KEYWORD, AND      SBG
*    THE FIRST NON-BLANK.  ANOTHER BUG WAS THAT THE FMID KEYWORD    SBG
*    IN A ++IF STATEMENT WAS IGNORED ONLY ON THE SAME LINE AS THE   SBG
*    ++IF, BUT NOT ON THE FOLLOWING LINES UNDER THE ++IF'S CONTROL. SBG
*                                                                    *
*  MODIFIED JUNE 26, 1986 BY SHMUEL GOLOB OF NEWSWEEK TO LOOK AT     *
*    ++APAR, ++USERMOD, AND ++FUNCTION IN ADDITION TO ++PTF.         *
*    ( I WANT TO KNOW WHAT FMIDS MY APARS AND USERMODS BELONG TO! )  *
*                                                                    *
*  THIS CODE WAS OBTAINED FROM FILE 118 OF THE CBT MVS MODS TAPE,    *
*    VERSION 260.  THE CODE THERE ONLY EXTRACTS PTFS.  I HAVE        *
*    MODIFIED IT IN THIS VERSION TO RECOGNIZE APARS, USERMODS, AND   *
*    FUNCTION SYSMODS ALSO.                                          *
*                                                                    *
*  THE OLD VERSION OF THIS PROGRAM REMAINS ON THIS FILE UNDER THE    *
*    MEMBER NAME PTFSXREF.  THE MEMBER OFILE118 HAS THE EXACT        *
*    CONTENTS OF FILE 118 FROM PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF THE CBT TAPE.    *
*                                                                    *
*  MY PROGRAM, SMPFMUPV, FROM FILE 428 OF THE CBT TAPE               *
*    CONVERTS THE OUTPUT OF THIS PROGRAM TO THE FORMAT:              *
*    ./  ADD  NAME=FMIDNAM                                           *
*          UZ11111  /*  FMID - FMIDNAM - FROM PUT TAPE - DATE  */    *
*                                                                    *
*    THIS IS SUITABLE FOR INPUT TO AN SMP APPLY OR LIST              *
*    JOB.  WE GET A "FORFMID" EFFECT, GOOD ON ANY VERSION            *
*    OF SMP, BECAUSE IT'S ONLY DEPENDENT ON THE SMPPTFIN FILE,       *
*    AND NOT ON THE VERSION OF SMP WHICH WILL PROCESS THAT FILE.     *
*                                                                    *
*    PLEASE LOOK ON FILE 428 TO GET THE MOST MILEAGE FROM THIS       *
*    PROGRAM, AND FOR OTHER USEFUL SMP TOOLS.                        *

*        THIS PROGRAM TAKES THE PUT PTF FILE (FILE 1 FROM A          *
*        STANDARD IBM PUT TAPE), AND PRODUCES A CROSS                *
*        REFERENCE OF THE PTF'S INCLUDED, SORTED BY FMID.            *
*        IT CAN TAKE CONCATENATED INPUT, BUT THE TAPE IDENITY        *
*        ON WHICH THE PTF IS FOUND WILL BE LOST. THE PROGRAM         *
*        SHOULD BE USEFUL TO QUICKLY IDENTIFY WHAT PTF'S             *
*        ARE ON A GIVEN TAPE, WHAT FMID'S HAVE MAINTENANCE ON        *
*        A TAPE, AND TO DOUBLE CHECK THE STERLING FORREST            *
*        CROSS REFERENCE (IT LIES ONCE IN A WHILE.)                  *
*                                                                    *

*        1.    THIS PROGRAM HAS AN INVOKED INCORE SORT.              *
*              IT LINKS TO THE ENTRY POINT OF "SORT".                *
*              CHANGE THE LINK MACRO IF YOU DO NOT SUPPORT           *
*              THAT NAME OR ALIAS. YOU WILL NEED ABOUT               *
*              300K FOR THE WHOLE PROGRAM AND SORT.                  *
*        2.    TITLES.  THIS FILE (FOR FMID TITLES) IS               *
*              OPTIONAL. IF NOT INCLUDED, YOU WILL GET A             *

*              I HAVE INCLUDED THE FILE IN THE JCL, I                *
*              CREATED THE FILE BY DOING THE FOLLOWING:              *
*              A. ALLOCATE A DATA SET ON TSO  - NORMAL STUFF -       *
*                  RECFM=FB,LRECL=80                                 *
*              B.  ASSIGN THAT DATA SET TO DD NAME OF OZPRINT        *
*              C.  EXECUTE YOUR INFO - SYS CLIST OR COMMAND          *
*              D.  ISSUE A 'DEF A' COMMAND TO INFO (SEARCH           *
*                  ALL FILES)                                        *
*              E.  DO A KEY WORD SEARCH AS FOLLOWS -                 *
*                  KWS FMID XREF      I GOT ABOUT 22 HITS,           *
*                  BUT THE FIRST ONE HAD A TITLE OF                  *
*                  'THIS IS A CROSS REFERENCE OF MVS FMIDS',         *
*                  OR SOMETHING SIMILAR. BE SURE YOU                 *

*                  'PRINT UP' COMMAND. THE OUTPUT WILL GO            *

*              H.  EDIT YOUR PRINT FROM THE INFO SESSION             *
*                  YOU WANT TO DELETE ALL LINES THAT DO              *
*                  NOT HAVE AN FMID IN COLUMN 3. NOTE THAT DELETED   *
*                  FMIDS HAVE A * IN COLUMN 3, FOR BETTER            *
*                  DOCUMENTATION I DELETE THE STAR ANDMOVE THE       *

*                  CAN BE EITHER INCLUDED IN THE JCL STREAM          *
