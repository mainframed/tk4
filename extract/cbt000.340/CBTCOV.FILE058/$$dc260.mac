 1.  IMPROVEMENT SUMMARY:  COBOL PROGRAMS SUFFIXED BY "Q" IN THEIR

       NAMES, TAKE LRECL(121) INPUT INSTEAD OF LRECL(133) INPUT.

       THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT I NOW USE THE "SAVE" OPTION OF

       QUEUE (FILE 393 OF CBT TAPE) TO GET THE DISK COPY OF THE SMP

       REPORT.  I USED TO USE THE TSO "OUTPUT" COMMAND TO WRITE THE

       LISTING TO AN LRECL(133) DATASET.  LRECL(121) IS THE "NATURAL"

       RECORD LENGTH FOR SMP REPORT OUTPUT.


 2.  I HAVE WRITTEN THE SMPFMIDV AND SMPFMUPV PROGRAMS TO ACCEPT THE

       RECFM=VBA OUTPUT OF THE "PUTXREF" PROGRAM DIRECTLY AS THEIR

       INPUT.  THUS NO RECFM CONVERSION IS NECESSARY FROM VB TO FB.

       THIS AVOIDS HAVING TO USE THE (PROPRIETARY) DSCOPY (AVAILABLE

       FOR 100 DOLLARS FROM DAVE COLE) OR SIMILAR SEQUENTIAL COPY

       PROGRAM TO DO THE CONVERSION.  THE OLD VERSIONS RETAIN THEIR

       OLD NAMES.  THE NEW VERSIONS ARE SMPFMIDV AND SMPFMUPV,

       RESPECTIVELY.


 3.  ISPF STATISTICS HAVE BEEN CHANGED TO MAKE THE USERID FIELD MORE

       DESCRIPTIVE OF THE PARTICULAR MEMBER AND ITS PURPOSE.


 NOTE TO YOU SYSTEMS PROGRAMMERS WHO USE ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE FOR
  EVERYTHING:  LOOK AT THE ALMOST TRIVIAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SMPFMUPV
  AND ITS PREDECESSOR SMPFMUPD.  IF YOU NEED A QUICK PROGRAM
  TO CONVERT A VB FILE TO FB AND VICE-VERSA, YOU CAN WRITE A 30 OR 40
  LINER IN COBOL WHICH WORKS FINE.  (SEE ITEM 4 BELOW.)


 4.  I'M INCLUDING A SAMPLE COBOL PROGRAM WHICH CONVERTS RECFM VB TO

       FB, JUST TO SHOW HOW EASY IT IS TO DO THE JOB IN COBOL.   IT IS

       CALLED VBTOFB.
