   The purpose of this package is to produce EXECUTABLE LISTS OF
SYSMODS FROM SMP4 REPORTS.  SMP reports on disk file (LRECL=121
or 133) are input to these programs. Lists of SYSMODs or ELEMENTs
are the output.  The lists of SYSMODs are in column 7 so they can
be merged with IBM EXCLUDE LISTS automatically in a sort-merge
step.  Helpful information from the reports is moved into a
comment field at the side of each SYSMOD name.  With the programs
in this package, I HAVE INSTALLED ENTIRE PUT TAPES WITHOUT
LOOKING AT A PAPER LISTING, AND THIS IS WITH SMP/4 !!!!!!  There
is also some adaptability to SMP/E.  see also, file 118 of cbt tape.

   The programs in this package are in 2 forms.  Those programs
with names ending in "Q" accept print input with LRECL(121).
The programs with similar names not ending in "Q" accept input
SMP reports with LRECL(133).

   This package contains programs in several categories:
These are:  FORFMID processing, HELDOFF processing,
            SELECT LIST processing, LISTCDS processing,
            RECEIVE processing, and ELEMENT processing.

  FORFMID PROCESSING:   Programs SMPFMIDV and SMPFMUPV break the
                          sysmods from a PTF TAPE or PUT TAPE down
                          separately by FMIDs, and produce a SORTED
                          LIST OF SYSMODS BELONGING TO EACH FMID.
                          In addition, SMPFMUPV puts ./ ADD cards
                          in before each CHANGE OF FMID, so that
                          IEBUPDTE can be used to make separate
                          sublists of sysmods, each belonging to
                          ONE FMID.  This gets the "FORFMID"
                          result.  Duplicate numbers are deleted in
                          each FMID sublist.  SMPFMID and SMPFMUPD
                          are the older version of these programs.

  HELDOFF PROCESSING:   Program SMPHOFF looks at a select list
                          from an apply or accept check SMP run.
                          This should be made with a bypass of
                          id, pre, req, and ifreq (but it doesn't
                          have to be).  All missing prerequisites
                          and the sysmods they hold off are
                          flagged, and written out in column 7
                          of a card-image file, with comments to
                          the right of each sysmod name.
                          A list of sysmods is produced as output,
                          which may contain duplicate names.  The
                          list is sorted in a separate JCL sort,
                          and the program SMPHDEL is used to
                          delete all duplicate names.  The resulting
                          sorted sysmod list can be sort-merged
                          with IBM's exclude list, and you can
                          rerun the apply or accept check with the
                          longer exclude list.  NO PAPER LISTING
                          NEED BE READ FOR THIS.  NO SYSMOD NAMES
                          HAVE TO BE COPIED BY HAND. THE PROCESS
                          TAKES TWO OR THREE MINUTES BETWEEN
                          APPLY CHECK RUNS.

  SELECT LIST PROCESSING:   Did you ever do a MASS APPLY or
                          ACCEPT, and desire a LIST OF ALL
                          SYSMODS selected?  Answer is probably
                          yes.  Getting the list in a form
                          executable by another SMP step (in
                          SMP4) is too much to ask for.  Well
                          YOU CAN GET IT NOW--and have the
                          FMID and the first PRE right there
                          too!!   The program SMPALIST takes an
                          APPLY or ACCEPT SYSMOD report as input,
                          returning a LIST OF ALL SELECTED SYSMODS
                          in card-image format so you can plug
                          it, or part of it, into another SMP job.

  LISTCDS PROCESSING:   Program SMPLIST will take as input a
                          LIST CDS or LIST ACDS run, and return
                          a list of the sysmods in card-image
                          format so you can put them into another
                          SMP job.  Some comments are included
                          with each sysmod.  I use this program
                          to DETERMINE WHICH PE'D PTFS HAVE BEEN
                          APPLIED TO MY SYSTEM ALREADY.  When
                          I am doing a put, and I get my new
                          exclude list, I do a LIST CDS SYSMOD
                          run against the new exclude list.
                          SMPLIST puts the output into card-image
                          form, one line per sysmod, and indicates
                          whether the sysmod is a FUNCTION, APAR,
                          PTF, or is SUPD.  Deleting all but the
                          non-SUPD PTFS gets me my required list.
                          This takes about 2 minutes after the
                          LIST CDS run finishes.

  RECEIVE PROCESSING:   The 2 programs SMPRCALL and SMPRCSUM
                          convert RECEIVE SUMMARY lists at the
                          end of the SMP RECEIVE report into
                          card-image lists of sysmods.
                          SMPRCSUM lists only sysmods actually
                          received.  SMPRCALL lists all of them.
                          Disposition of each sysmod is copied
                          from the report into a comment field,
                          along with time and date received.
                          The program SMPRECVD converts output
                          from SMPRCALL into SMPRCSUM form by
                          deleting sysmods from the list which
                          have not been received normally.

  ELEMENT PROCESSING:   The 2 programs SMPELMNT and SMPELSYS
                          produce LISTS OF ELEMENTS AFFECTED by
                          an SMP APPLY or ACCEPT run, in 80-byte
                          card-image format.  Comments from the
                          ELEMENT REPORT are copied into a
                          comment field alongside the element
                          name.  These 2 programs differ only
                          slightly from each other.  One gets its
                          sysmod name field from the CURRENT RMID
                          field of the SMP ELEMENT REPORT.  The
                          other gets that name from the SYSMOD
                          NAME field.

   ISPF ids now describe the members in the PDS fairly accurately.
DOC is documentation.  Source is marked COBOL if it is in cobol,
and ASSEMBL if it is in assembler.  All members connected with the
PUTXREF program from file 118 of the CBT tape, are marked PUTXREF.
Sample jcl is marked JCL.  Sample output from the programs is marked
SAMPLE.
