*       CLEAR A 3270 DISPLAY STATION SCREEN (ACTS AS A NOP ON A       *
*       HARDCOPY TERMINAL).  THE MOST SIGNIFICANT USE OF THIS         *
*       COMMAND IS TO CLEAR THE TERMINAL SCREEN FROM A CLIST SO       *
*       IT CAN BEGIN IT'S OUTPUT AT THE TOP OF A FRESH SCREEN.        *
*       THIS PROGRAM CAN ALSO BE CALLED FROM A COMMAND PROCESSOR      *
*       AS A SUBROUTINE TO CLEAR A 3270 SCREEN.                       *
*                                                                     *
