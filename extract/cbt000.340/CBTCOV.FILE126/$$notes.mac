1) IEECVXIT HAS BEEN MODIFIED TO ISSUE A HOLD AND CANCEL WHEN A CLASS
   X JOB ISSUES A MOUNT. THIS ROUTINE HAS BEEN TESTED AND THE ONLY PROB-
   LEM FOUND WAS THAT THE HOLD AND CANCEL ARE ISSUED FOR DISK MOUNTS
   AS WELL. THE SOURCE IS IN P50030N ON PANVALET AND THE LOAD MODULE
   IS IN SYS1.TSLINKT.
2) RACF TSO COMMAND CHECKING HAS BEEN SUCCESSFULLY TESTED FOR BOTH
   PRIMARY AND SUBCOMMANDS. THE CODE CONSISTS OF THREE PARTS. THE
   THE FIRST IS MODULE IKJEFTB2. THIS MODULE HANDLES PRIMARY COMMAND
   AUTHORIZATION CHECKING. IT IS A REPLACEMENT FOR A PCF MODULE. SEE
   THE PCF MANUALS FOR PROPER LINKING INSTRUCTIONS. THE SECOND MODULE
   IS MBCSCAN. THIS MODULE HANDLES SUBCOMMAND AUTHORIZATION CHECKING.
   IT IS A REPLACEMENT FOR PCF MODULE PCFSCAN AND SHOULD BE LINKED
   AS A FRONT END TO SYSTEM MODULE AS IKJSCAN. THE THIRD COMPONENT
   IS P50255. THIS PROGRAM PERFORMS A RACLIST AND CHAINS THE LIST
   OFF THE RCVT. ALL PROGRAMS ARE IN TS14.RAC.SOURCE. THE CURRENT
   VERSIONS OF IKJEFTB2 AND MBCSCAN SHOULD BE MODIFIED TO DO A
   FRACHECK IF PROGRAM P50255 IS USED. CURRENTLY, THEY ARE DOING
   RACHECKS FOR THE COMMANDS IN THE CLASS OF $AAMISC. IN ADDITION,
   THERE IS A ROUTINE NAMED MBCINTR WHICH CAN BE USED FOR TESTING
   MBCSCAN. THIS ROUTINE FRONT ENDS BOTH PCFSCAN AND MBCSCAN AND
   DETERMINES WHICH ONE TO GIVE CONTROL TO BY THE PRESENCE OF A
   BIT IN A SWITCH LABELED MBCSW.
3. THE JES2 READER ORIGIN CHANGES WERE NEVER INSTALLED. THESE CHANGES
   ARE IN TS14.JES2.SOURCE. THESE CHANGES WILL REQUIRE A COLD START
   IPL AND WILL ALSO FIX A PROBLEM WHICH CAUSES THE CHECK FOR USERID
   EQUAL TO THE FIRST 4 CHARACTERS OF JOB NAME TO BE BYPASSED FOR JOBS
   SUBMITTED VIA THE INTERNAL READER
4. USE OF SVC 231 SHOULD BE ENFORCED BY CAUSING THE NOT FOUND CONDITION
   TO NOT ALLOW AUTHORIZATION. THIS CAN BE DONE BY A ZAP.
5. WHEN A USER SIGNS TO E/1 UNDER RACF, THE USER'S PROFILE SHOULD BE
   CHECKED TO INSURE THAT THE LAST LOGGED ON STATISTICS ARE PROPERLY
   UPDATED.
6. A RACF COMMAND PREPROCESSING EXIT SHOULD BE WRITTEN TO CONTROL THE
   USE OF THE NOSET AND SET PARAMETERS.
7. THERE ARE A VARIETY OF MISCELLANEOUS TMS CHANGES WHICH ARE DOCUMENT-
   ED IN TS14.RAC.SOURCE($TMS).
8. THE USE OF THE SMF COMMON EXIT PARAMETER AREA USER COMMUNICATIONS
   FIELD SHOULD BE GENERALIZED. THIS FIELD SHOULD POINT TO A VECTOR
   TABLE WHICH CAN BE EXPANDED EASILY.
9. E/1 RACF POSSIBILITIES. CONSIDER A MENU DRIVEN TRANSACTION FACILITY,
   SIMILAR TO SPF. EACH USER WOULD SEE A SELECTION MENU OF ALL THE
   TRANSACTIONS TO WHICH HE HAS ACCESS. CONSIDER ELIMINATING THE TYPE 4
   PASSWORD RECORD. THIS COULD BE DONE BY DEFINING E/1 AS AN APPLICATION
   IN THE CLASS APPL AND CHECKING AUTHORIZATION TO THE APPLICATION AT
   LOGON TIME. USE OF THE APPL CLASS WILL PROVIDE A CONVENIENT METHOD BY
   WHICH TO CONTROL USER'S ACCESS TO A VARIETY OF APPLICATIONS (EG.
   (TSO,E/1,OPC,VIDEO, ETC.).
