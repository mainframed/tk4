*                                                                      *

   THE PURPOSE OF THE JOB LOADING FACILITY IS TO PROVIDE A CONTROLLED
MECHANISM FOR SUBMITTING JOBS TO THE BATCH QUEUE. IN ADDITION IT PRO-
VIDES A METHOD FOR INSERTING THE CURRENT PASSWORD IN THE JOB CARD OF
JOBS BEING SUBMITTED TO THE INTERNAL READER.
   THE FACILITY CONSISTS OF TWO PRIMARY COMPONENTS:
         1) A STARTED TASK KNOWN AS MBRDR
         2) A BATCH PROGRAM WHICH COMMUNICATES WITH MBRDR KNOWN AS
            Z999LOAD
*
A. THE BATCH PROGRAM OPERATES AS FOLLOWS:
*
     1. JOBS TO BE SUBMITTED ARE DETERMINED BY EITHER A PARAMETER OR A
        SERIES OF CONTROL CARDS.
     2. TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR SUBMISSION TO MBRDR, THE JOB MUST MEET THE
        FOLLOWING REQUIREMENTS:
         A. THE NAME OF THE DATASET CONTAINING THE JCL TO BE SUBMITTED
            BE IN THE FORM XXXX.F01640 WHERE XXXX IS ANY VALID
            HIGH LEVEL QUALIFIER.
         B. IF THE JOB BEING SUBMITTED REQUIRES THE PASSWORD TO BE
            FILLED IN BY MBRDR, THE PASSWORD PARAMETER MUST HAVE BEEN
            SPECIFIED ON THE JOB RUNNING Z999LOAD. THIS RESTRICTION
            IS IMPOSED TO ALLOW MBRDR TO PROPERLY IDENTIFY THE SUBMITTER
     3. IF THE JOB FAILS THESE CRITERIA IT WILL BE COPIED, UNMODIFIED
        TO A DATASET WHICH CAN BE ALLOCATED TO AN INTERNAL READER.
     4. IF THE JOB WAS SUBMITTED TO MBRDR AND MBRDR WAS UNABLE TO
        SUBMIT IT, A MESSAGE IS LOGGED AND THE JOB IS COPIED, UN-
        MODIFIED TO A DATASET WHICH CAN BE ALLOCATED TO AN INTERNAL
        READER.
*
B. THE STARTED TASK OPERATES AS FOLLOWS:
*
     1. MBRDR WAITS UNTIL A CONSOLE OR A BATCH PROGRAM ISSUES A MODIFY.
     2. WHEN A MODIFY IS RECEIVED, MBRDR DYNAMICALLY ALLOCATES THE
        DATASET WHERE THE JCL IS LOCATED.
     3. IF THE JOB IS FROM THE MASTER OR TAPE CONSOLE AND REQUIRES A
        PASSWORD, THE PASSWORD IS FILLED IN AND THE JOB IS SUBMITTED
        TO THE INTERNAL READER.
     4. FOR ALL OTHER JOBS, IF THE JOB REQUIRES THAT A PASSWORD BE
        FILLED IN, THE USER MUST BE AUTHORIZED TO SUBMIT THE JOB. A
        RACHECK IS PERFORMED ON THE JOBNAME BEING SUBMITTED TO DETERMINE
        IF THE USER HAS THE NECESSARY AUTHORITY TO SUBMIT THE JOB.
        INSUFFICIENT AUTHORITY RESULTS INSUBMISSION BEING BYPASSED AND
        Z999LOAD IS NOTIFIED WITH AN APPROPRIATE RETURN CODE. IF THE
        SUBMITTER HAS SUFFICIENT AUTHORITY TO SUBMIT THE JOB, THE
        PASSWORD IS FILLED IN AND IT IS SUBMITTED TO THE INTERNAL
        READER.
     5. WHEN MBRDR IS THROUGH PROCESSING A MODIFY COMMAND, IT FREES ANY
        UNNECESSARY FILES, POSTS Z999LOAD IF NECESSARY, AND WAITS FOR
        THE NEXT MODIFY.
