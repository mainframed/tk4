1. SPFTIQ CURRENTLY ISSUES A RACHECK ON A RESOURCE IN CLASS OF TIMS TO
   DETERMINE WHETHER A USER CAN USE THE UPDATE FEATURES OF TIQ. THE
   RESOURCE SHOULD BE IN ANOTHER CLASS TO AVOID CONFUSION WITH E/1
   TRANSACTIONS.
*
2. TMS ISSUES A RACHECK ON A RESOURCE IN THE CLASS OF TIMS TO DETERMINE
   WHETHER A USER CAN CREATE A NO LABEL TAPE. THE RESOURCE SHOULD BE IN
   ANOTHER CLASS TO AVOID CONFUSION WITH E/1 TRANSACTIONS.
*
3. THE RACF TMS CODE HAS A FEATURE WHICH PROVIDES THE BASE NAME OF A
   GDG AS THE MODEL NAME. THIS FACILITY SHOULD BE MOVED TO THE RACDEF
   EXIT SO THAT THE SAME TYPE OF MODELING COULD BE DONE FOR DISK GDGS.
*
4. ONCE A TAPE IS RACF PROTECTED, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO UPDATE THAT TAPE
   WITH SPFTIQ OR TMSTIQ. IT CAN ONLY BE UPDATED BY THE TMS BATCH
   UPDATE PROGRAM AND THE USER MUST SPECIFY THE TMS MASTER PASSWORD.
   THIS PASSWORD IS THE SAME FOR ALL TAPES. THIS SHOULD BE CHANGED
   SO THAT BOTH THE TSO AND BATCH PROGRAM DO A RACHECK ON A RESOURCE
   TO DETERMINE WHETHER A USER CAN UPDATE PROTECTED TAPES. THERE ARE
   TWO POSSIBLE APPROACHES TO THIS:
   A. A SINGLE RESOURCE COULD BE DEFINED WHICH WOULD CONTROL WHO HAD
      AUTHORITY TO UPDATE PROTECTED TAPES.
   B. A RACHECK COULD BE ISSUED ON THE DATASET NAME TO SEE IF THE USER
      WHO IS REQUESTING THE UPDATE HAS AT LEAST UPDATE ACCESS TO THE
      TAPE.
   THE SECOND APPROACH HAS THE ADVANTAGE THAT THE OWNER OF THE TAPE
   COULD MODIFY THE TMS RECORD, BUT THE DISADVANTAGE THAT A CENTRAL
   CONTROL PERSON WHO WAS NOT ON THE ACCESS LIST, COULD NOT UPDATE IT.
*
5. THE RACHECK PRE PROCESSING EXIT SHOULD BE CHANGED TO FORCE A
   A NOT-FOUND CONDITION FOR CLASS OF TAPEVOLS. THIS IS A PERFORMANCE
   IMPROVEMENT AND DOES NOT AFFECT THE OPERATION OF RACF TAPE SUPPORT.
