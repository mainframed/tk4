PURPOSE: TO PROVIDE TAPE DATASET PROTECTION AT THE DATASET LEVEL ON A
         SELECTIVE BASIS USING RACF. THE NEED FOR A COMMON SECURITY
         MECHANISM (I.E. RACF) AT THE DATASET LEVEL HAD NOT BEEN MET BY
         UCC-1(TMS) OR THE RACF PROVIDED TAPE VOLUME PROTECTION.

GENERAL APPROACH:

         A) SELECTIVE DATASET PROTECTION WILL BE IMPLEMENTED BY USE OF T
            PROTECT KEYWORD. THE DIFFERENCE IN OUR APPROACH WILL BE THAT
            THE DSN AND NOT THE VOLUME WILL BE PROTECTED. THE RESTRICTIO
            THAT APPLY TO THE USE OF THE PROTECT KEYWORD REMAIN IN FORCE
            I.E. STANDARD LABELED TAPE, FIRST DATA SET ON VOLUME, ETC.
            ALL DSNS ARE DEFINED IN THE DATASET CLASS, BUT BECAUSE THE
            PROTECT KEYWORD IS BEING USED TO DRIVE THE PROTECTION, IT IS
            NECESSARY THAT THE TAPEVOL CLASS BE ACTIVE. FAILURE TO HAVE
            THE TAPEVOL CLASS ACTIVE WILL RESULT IN A JCL ERROR.

         B) RACHECKS FOR INPUT TAPES WILL BE ISSUED ONLY FOR TAPES WHICH
            ARE FLAGGED AS PROTECTED IN THE TMC. THIS IMPLIES THAT
            A USER MAY NOT SIMPLY DEFINE A TAPE WITH THE ADDSD COMMAND
            AND EXPECT TO GET RACF TAPE PROTECTION. THE RACF COMMANDS
            DO NOT UPDATE THE TMC. ANOTHER IMPLICATION OF THIS IS
            THAT THERE WILL BE NO PROTECTION OF TAPES OUTSIDE THE
            MILLER DATA CENTER SINCE THE LABEL CONTAINS NO INDICATION TH
            THE TAPE IS RACF PROTECTED.

         C) THE RACDEF'S ISSUED AGAINST THE TAPEVOL CLASS BY OPEN/CLOSE/
            EOV (OR ANYONE ELSE) WILL BE NOP'ED BY THE RACDEF PRE-
            PROCESSING EXIT. THIS ENABLES USE OF THE PROTECT KEYWORD
            WITHOUT ACTUALLY DEFINING A PROFILE FOR THE VOLUME. THE
            ACTUAL RACDEF FOR THE DSN WILL BE DONE FROM TMS.

         D) ALL RACHECK'S ISSUED FOR CLASS OF TAPEVOL BY OPEN/CLOSE/
            EOV (OR ANYONE ELSE) WILL NOP'ED BY THE RACHECK PRE-
            PROCESSING EXIT. THE EXIT WILL FORCE A RETURN CODE OF 4 TO
            THE ISSUER OF THE RACHECK WHICH INDICATES TO THE ISSUER
            THAT THE RESOURCE IS NOT FOUND.

         E) RACF ITSELF MUST BE SUPERZAPED SO THAT RACDEF REQUESTS FOR
            CLASS OF 'DATASET' FOR NON-DASD VOLUMES WILL BE NOT FAILED.
            THIS ZAP IS THE ONLY CHANGE TO IBM CODE WHICH IS NECESSARY
            FOR THIS IMPLEMENTATION.

         F) WHEN TAPES BECOME SCRATCH THEIR RACF PROFILE WILL AUTOMATIC-
            ALLY BE DELETED.

         G) THE RULES FOR USE OF 98000 TAPES HAVE BEEN MODIFIED
            SLIGHTLY. IF A TAPE IS A SYNONYM OF ONE IN THE TMC AND
            THE TMC INDICATES THAT THE VOLUME IS PROTECTED, THE JOB
            WILL BE ABENDED WITH A SECURITY VIOLATION. THIS MEANS THAT
            IF AN OUT-OF-HOUSE HAS THE SAME VOLUME SERIAL NUMBER AS
            A PROTECTED MILLER TAPE, IT MUST FIRST BE COPIED USING DEBE.

         H) THE ACCESS LIST AND UACC FOR A PROTECTED TAPE WILL BE COPIED
            FROM A MODEL RESOURCE (NAMED WITH THE BASE DSN IF IT IS A
            GDG, OR THE DSN FOR A NON GDG.) IF THE MODEL EXISTS; OTHER-
            WISE, THE CREATOR OF THE TAPE WILL BE THE SOLE ENTRY ON
            THE ACCESS LIST AND THE UACC WILL BE NONE.

            THE MODEL RESOURCE MUST BE IN THE DATASET CLASS AND THERE-
            FORE MUST BE CREATED WITH THE ADDSD COMMAND. TO AVOID
            ACTUALLY HAVING A DISK DATASET WITH THE MODEL NAME, THE
            NOSET OPTION SHOULD BE USED WHEN CREATING THE RESOURCE. IN
            ORDER FOR THE MODELING TO BE PROPERLY PERFORMED THE MODEL
            MUST BE DEFINED ON VOLUME 'TAPE  '.

         I) WHEN A PROTECTED TAPE IS PUT INTO SCRATCH STATUS, IT
            CANNOT BE MANUALLY TAKEN OUT OF SCRATCH STATUS AND REUSED.
            IT MAY ONLY BE MOUNTED TO SATISFY A REQUEST FOR A SCRATCH.

         J) FIELDS IN THE TMC FOR PROTECTED VOLUMES CANNOT BE UPDATED
            ONLINE(EG. YOU CANNOT EXPIRE A PROTECTED VOLUME USING
            SPFTIQ). ALL UPDATES MUST BE DONE IN BATCH AND A PASSWORD
            MUST BE SUPPLIED. THE PASSWORD IS PUT ON AT OPEN TIME
            BY TMS AND IS THE SAME FOR ALL TAPES. CURRENTLY IT IS THE
            TMS MASTER PASSWORD - TMS(321). THIS CAN BE CHANGED ONLY
            BY CHANGING THE CODE.

         K) TO FURTHER INSURE TAPE SECURITY, USE OF BLP WILL BE DIS-
            ALLOWED VIA THE RDR PARAMETERS. JES2 INITIALIZATION HAS
            BEEN MODIFIED TO INFORM THE OPERATOR IF ANY CLASSES PERMIT
            BLP. THE OPERATOR THEN ASKED WHETHER TO PROCEED OR NOT.
            IN ADDITION THE TYPE 43 JES2 INITIALIZATION SMF RECORD HAS
            BEEN EXPANDED TO LIST THE CLASSES FOR WHICH BLP IS ACTIVE.
            THESE MODIFICATIONS ARE IN PANVALET MEMBER P50033.

         L) NL USAGE ON OUTPUT WILL BE CONTROLLED VIA A RACHECK AGAINST
            A GENERAL RESOURCE. CURRENTLY THE RESOURCE IS IN THE CLASS
            TIMS AND 'NLTAPE'.

IMPLEMENTATION

         A) TMS MODULE IGC0AXXX WAS MODIFIED TO FORCE ALL TAPES THROUGH
            THE SECURITY MODULE. NO CHANGE WAS NEEDED FOR MODULE IGC02XX
            SINCE THAT MODULE DEALS ONLY WITH SECONDARY DATASETS AND
            THE USE OF THE PROTECT KEYWORD PRECLUDES ANY DATASET WITH
            A SEQUENCE NUMBER OTHER THAN ONE. THESE CHANGES CAN BE
            FOUND IN IEBUPDTE FORM IN PANVALET MEMBER P50093.
         B) TMS MODULE IGC0BXXX WAS TOTALLY REPLACED BY A NEW SECURITY
            MODULE TO IMPLEMENT THE RACF SUPPORT. THIS MODULE CAN BE
            FOUND IN PANVALET MEMBER P50230.
         C) TMS MODULE IGC0DXXX WAS MODIFIED TO PERFORM THE RACHECK ON
            98000 NL TAPES AND TO PREVENT SYNONYMS ON PROTECTED TAPES.
            THESE CHANGES CAN BE FOUND IN IEBUPDTE FORM ON PANVALET
            MEMBER P50093.
         D) TMS MODULE TMSCLEAN WAS MODIFIED TO DO A RACDEF DELETE OF
            ANY PROTECT TAPE WHEN IT BECOMES SCRATCH. THESE CHANGES CAN
            BE FOUND IN IEBUPDTE FORM IN PANVALET MEMBER P50093.
         E) THE RACHECK AND RACDEF PREPROCESSING EXITS WERE MODIFIED
            TO NOP THE REQUESTS FOR THE TAPEVOL CLASS. THESE CAN BE
            FOUND IN PANVALET MEMBERS P50029 AND P50217 RESPECTIVELY.
         F) NO CHANGES HAD TO BE MADE TO THE ONLINE TMS INQUIRY PROGRAM
            TO PROHIBIT UPDATING OF PROTECTED TAPES, SINCE THIS FEATURE
            HAD ALREADY BEEN IMPLEMENTED FOR TMS PROTECTED TAPES AND THE
            SAME FIELDS ARE BEING USED.
         G) THE FOLLOWING ZAP MUST BE APPLIED TO RACF

ERROR CODES

         SECURITY VIOLATIONS RESULT IN AN IEFTMS50 MESSAGE WITH AN
         ABEND CODE OF THE FORM 240-XX WHERE XX IS THE RETURN CODE.
         THE POSSIBLE RETURN CODES AND THEIR MEANINGS ARE LISTED BELOW.

         04 - INPUT WITH TMC FLAGGED AS PROTECTED AND NO RACF PROFILE
         08 - ACCESS FOR INPUT TAPE DENIED
         0C - INVALID RETURN CODE FROM RACHECK(>=12)
         10 - ALLOCATION TO DATA SET AFTER SCRATCH
         14 - RACDEF RETURN CODE OF 8
         18 - ILLEGAL RETURN CODE FROM RACDEF (>8)
         1C - OUTPUT DATA SET WITH PROTECT=YES, AND ALREADY DEFINED TO
              RACF, BUT NOT FLAGGED IN TMC
         20 - RACHECK FAILED ON OUTPUT TAPE
         24 - RETURN CODE 12 FROM OUTPUT RACHECK
         28 - 98000 TAPE
         2C - UNAUTHORIZED USE OF NL TAPE

SUMMARY: THE BASIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OUR VERSION AND THAT USED BY
         BOISE CASCADE MAY BE SUMMARIZED BY :


         1.  ALL TAPES ARE NOT PROTECTED. ONLY TAPES INDICATED IN TMS
             BY THE TMC PASSWORD BITS SET ARE PROTECTED.  THIS GIVES US
             THE FLEXIBILITY WE DESIRE.

         2.  RACHECK IS DONE ONLY ON PROTECTED TAPE DATASETS.

         3.  RACF 'TAPEVOL' CLASS IS TURNED 'ON' .  THIS ALLOWS US TO
             USE STANDARD JCL  'PROTECT=YES'  ON OUR DD STATEMENTS
             TO REQUEST PROTECTION.  NO ACTIVITY  NORMALLY ASSOCIATED
             WITH TAPEVOL CLASS TAKES PLACE. THE EXITS BYPASS ALL RACF
             ACTIVITY FOR OTHER TAPES.
             RACHECK AND RACDEF EXITS ARE CODED TO TREAT ALL MVS
             RACF ACTIVITY FOR TAPEVOL AS 'NOT SPECIFIED' OR
             'REQUEST ACCEPTED' WITH  NO  RACF I/O ACTIVITY.

         4.  BLP AND NL ARE RACHECK PROTECTED.
