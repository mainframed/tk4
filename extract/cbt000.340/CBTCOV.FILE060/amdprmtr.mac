  THIS PROGRAM WILL RUN AS AN EXIT TO PRINTDUMP. ITS'S FUNCTION IS TO
  FORMAT THE MASTER TRACE TABLE FOR AN SVC OR STANDALONE DUMP. IT WILL
  1ST CHECK TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SYSTEM HAS SU64 INSTALLED AND THE
  MASTER TRACE IS ACTIVE. THE OUTPUT WILL BE IN 'REVERSE' ORDER DUE
  TO THE FACT THAT THE MASTER TRACE IS A BACKWARD WRAP-AROUND TABLE.
  TO IMPLEMENT THIS EXIT, IT MUST FIRST BE LINKED INTO EITHER
  LINKLIB OR A USER LIBRARY (USE STEPLIB ON PRINTDUMP IF SO), AND THE
  PRINTDUMP EXIT CONTROL TABLE ZAPPED TO INCLUDE THE EXIT NAME.

         E.G.    NAME AMDPRECT
                 VER 00C8 4040404040404040,00000000,4040404040404040
                 REP 00C8 D4E3D9C1C3C54040,20000000,D4E3D9C1C3C54040

                 THE ABOVE ZAP WILL CAUSE THE EXIT TO BE ENTERED
                 WHENEVER THE FORMAT OPTION IS CHOSEN IN PRINTDUMP,
                 OR THE KEYWORD  'MTRACE' IS USED.

                 IF IT IS PREFERRED TO USE THE EXIT VIA KEYWORD ONLY,
                 CHANGE THE REP TO :

                 REP 00C8 D4E3D9C1C3C54040,00000000,D4E3D9C1C3C54040

                 AND USE THE KEYWORD 'MTRACE' WHEN USING PRINTDUMP.
                 WITH THE FIRST ZAP THE FORMAT OPTION OR THE KEYWORD
                 MAY BE USED. WITH THE 2ND ONLY THE KEYWORD WILL CAUSE
                 THE EXIT TO BE CALLED.
