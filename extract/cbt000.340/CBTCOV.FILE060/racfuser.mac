The RACFUSER program extracts user data from RACF user profiles, and
formats the extracted data into an output file suitable for input to
user developed programs.

One of the fields returned by the RACFUSER program is the user data
area, which by itself may be as much as 255 bytes long. In order to
preserve the ability of this program's output to be processed by ISPF
functions (which are sometimes limited to a maximum record length of
255), the output from the program is in the form of two 255-byte long
records per user.

Output from the RACFUSER program is formatted as follows:

 Record 1: Columns   1-8: User-ID
           Columns  9-28: User name
           Columns 29-36: Owner
           Columns 37-44: Default group
           Column     45: REVOKED indicator
           Column     46: SPECIAL indicator
           Column     47: OPERATIONS indicator
           Column     48: AUDITOR indicator
           Column     49: USER AUDIT indicator
           Columns 50-52: Last signon date
           Columns 53-56: Last signon time
           Columns 57-59: Last password change date
           Column     60: Password change interval

 Record 2: Columns 1-255: User data area

Output from the RACFUSER program will be a listing of the user profile
data extracted sorted alphabetically by user profile name (user-ID).

RACFUSER is most useful in combination with other RACF reporting
programs found on this tape; for example, combining RACFUSER output with
that of RACFDSET, it is possible to construct a report of RACF dataset
authorizations sorted by user-ID, or even user name.

RACFUSER must be linkedited APF authorized and run from an APF
authorized library.
