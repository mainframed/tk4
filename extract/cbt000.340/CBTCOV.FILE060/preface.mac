      THE TAPE CONTAINS SEVERAL UTILITY PROGRAMS, A NUMBER OF TSO
 COMMANDS, SOME SPF UTILITIES, AND A FEW TSO CLISTS. SOME SPECIAL
 DOCUMENTATION IS PROVIDED IN THE DOCUMENT DATASET. SOME SPECIAL MACROS
 ARE ALSO PROVIDED IN THE MACLIB DATASET.  HELP MEMBERS FOR THE TSO
 COMMANDS AND CLISTS ARE PROVIDED IN THE HELP PDS. TUTORIALS FOR SOME OF
 THE SPF UTILITIES ARE PROVIDED IN THE PANELS PDS. MOST OF THE PROGRAMS
 NEED MVSUG.MACLIB TO ASSEMBLE CORRECTLY.  SOME PROGRAMS REQUIRE THAT
 MVSUG.MACLIB BE CONCATENATED AHEAD OF SYS1.MACLIB BECAUSE OF NAME
 DUPLICATION.  SEVERAL OF THE PROGRAMS NEED MACROS FROM SYS1.AMODGEN
 AND/OR SYS1.PVTMACS TO BE ASSEMBLED. SEE THE SAMPLE ASSEMBLY JCL
 IN MVSUG.CNTL.

      A FINE SET OF STRUCTURED ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE MACROS ARE CONTAINED IN
 MVSUG.MACLIB. THE SOURCE FOR THE 'IDMF' SPF UTILITY WILL SERVE AS A
 SAMPLE PROGRAM USING THESE MACROS.

      TO THE LEFT OF THE SYNOPSIS OF THE ITEMS ON THE TAPE LISTED IN
 THIS INDEX THERE MAY BE A VERSION NUMBER.  THIS NUMBER INDICATES THE
 VERSION OF THE MVS USER GROUP TAPE AT WHICH EITHER THE ITEM WAS ADDED
 OR UPDATED.  USE THE VERSION NUMBER TO SEE WHAT HAS CHANGED SINCE YOU
