JESEXIT6 is a JES2 exit #6 that performs the function of tape drive
selection based upon the retention duration or volume serial number of
the tape being requested.

This is perhaps most useful during the transition from 3420 tape reels
to 3480 tape cartridges, when it may be desirable to differentiate
different data for different device types.

As written, the exit forces tape outputs with retention periods of a
year or longer onto 3420 tape reels, while shorter retention periods are
routed to 3480 tape cartridges. Action by the exit is stimulated by the
appearance of a "UNIT=TAPE" parameter on a JCL 'DD' card, and rerouting
is accomplished by changing this 'TAPE' esoteric name to either '3420'
(for round reels) or '3480' (for tape cartridges). Therefore, all three
of these esoteric names must be present in the environment before this
exit is useful (as coded). This can be accomplished easily via the
DYNAMASK program (available elsewhere on this tape).

JESEXIT6 was originally written in an MVS/XA 2.1.3, JES2 2.1.5
environment, and may well require reassembly in other environments. In
the CNTL library of this tape appears a sample job stream to install
this exit as an SMP/E USERMOD.
