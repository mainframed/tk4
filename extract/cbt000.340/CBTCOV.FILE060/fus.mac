'FUS' IS A DATASET MAINTAINCE UTILITY PROVIDING FACILITIES FOR
UNCATALOGING, SCRATCHING, AND LOCATING DATASETS WITHOUT THE USER
HAVING TO KNOW WHICH VOLUMES CONTAIN THE DATASETS. THE LOCATE AND
SCRATCH FUNCTIONS ARE PERFORMED AGAINST ALL PERMANENTLY MOUNTED
DIRECT ACCESS VOLUMES THAT HAVE A VOLUME STATUS OF 'STORAGE' OR
'PUBLIC'. THE LOCATE AND SCRATCH FUNCTIONS CAN ALSO BE PERFORMED
AGAINST 'PRIVATE' VOLUMES IF THE USER SUPPLIES AND 'ALLOW' PARAMETER
UPON PROGRAM INVOCATION.

PARM FIELD FOR EXECUTION:

THE PARM FIELD PARAMETERS ARE OPTIONAL. THEY ARE POSITIONAL AND
MUST OCCUR IN THE SEQUENCE (ALLOW,NOPRINT).

   ALLOW   - ALLOWS THE PROGRAM TO ACCESS ALL PERMANANTLY MOUNTED
             VOLUMES WITH THE ATTRIBUTE OF 'PRIVATE'

   NOPRINT - SUPRESSES THE PRINTING OF VOLUME ACCESSIBILIITY
             MESSAGES TO REDUCE OUTPUT.

IF NOPRINT IS SPECIFIED WITHOUT ALLOW, THE PRECEDING COMMA MUST
BE INCLUDED

              PARM='ALLOW'
              PARM='ALLOW,NOPRINT'
              PARM=',NOPRINT'

CONTROL STATEMENTS:

COLUMN   1-9:     FUNCTION COMMAND - BEGIN IN COLUMN 1 CODE
                  FIND UNCATLG OR SCRATCH.

COLUMN 10-72:     OPERANDS - BEGIN IN COLUMN 10 CODE
                  DSN=DSNAME,ALL
                  ALL SHOULD ONLY BE CODED WITH THE 'SCRATCH'
                  FUNCTION

FUNCTIONS:

   FIND
   ----
   REQUESTS THAT ALL THE ACCESSIBILE DIRECT ACCESS VOLUMES BE
   SEARCHED FOR THE NAMED DATASET. THE SERIAL NUMBER OF THE
   VOLUME(S) TO WHICH THE DATASET IS CATALOGED AND THE
   SERIAL NUMBER OF ALL ACCESSIBLE VOLUMES CONTAINING THE
   DATASET ARE REPORTED.

   UNCATLG
   -------
   REQUESTS THAT THE NAMED DATASET BE UNCATALOGED. THIS FUNCTION
   MAY BE USED FOR TAPE DATASETS AS WELL AS DIRECT ACCESS DATASETS.

   SCRATCH
   -------
   REQUESTS THAT THE NAMED DATASET BE DELETED FROM EVERY DIRECT
   ACCESS VOLUME ON WHICH IT IS FOUND. IF THE 'ALL' OPTION IS NOT
   SPECIFIED, THE DATASET WILL NOT BE DELETED FROM THE VOLUME TO
   WHICH IT IS CATALOGED.

   REQUESTS TO SCRATCH GENERATION GROUP DATASETS ARE APPLICIBLE ONLY
   TO THE GENERATIONS IN THE CATALOG WHEN GDG GROUPNAME OR
   RELATIVE GENERATIONS ARE SPECIFIED.TO SCRATCH ALL THE
   CATALOGED GENERATIONS OF A GROUP ',ALL' MUST BE CODED.

   SYNTAX OF THE SCRATCH FUNCTION:

        COLUMN 1         COLUMN 10
        SCRATCH          DSN=GDG.GROUP.NAME,ALL
        SCRATCH          DSN=GDG.GROUP.NAME(-2),ALL
        SCRATCH          DSN=GDG.GROUP.NAME.GNNNNV00,ALL
        SCRATCH          DSN=DATA.SET.NAME,ALL

    LEAVING OFF THE ',ALL' WITH GENERATION DATA GROUP NAMES OR
    RELATIVE GENERATION DATASET NAMES WILL RESULT IN THE DATASET(S)
    NOT BEING SCRATCHED. LEAVING OFF ',ALL' FOR ABSOLUTE GENERATION
    NUMBER DATASETS WILL RESULT IN ALL OCCURANCES OF THAT DATASET
    EXCEPT THE CATALOGED ONE BEING SCRATCHED.

    IN ALL CASES, DATASETS THAT ARE SCRATCHED ARE UNCATALOGED IF
    THEY ARE IN THE CATALOG.
