*        THIS PROGRAM WILL SAMPLE UCB'S AND QCB'S IN AN MVS           *
*        ENVIRONMENT AND KEEP TRACK OF THE NUMBER OF RESERVES,        *
*        THE HIGH WATER MARK AND THE TOTAL TIME OF THE                *
*        RESERVES FOR EACH DEVICE AND QNAME.                          *
*        IT HAS BEEN EXPANDED TO INCLUDE RESERVED NOT BUSY TIME AND   *
*        LOCKOUT TIME WHICH CAN BE CAUSED BY A RESERVE FROM ANOTHER   *
*        CPU OR THE HEAD OF STRING BUSY.                              *
*                                                                     *
*        OPTIONALLY IT WILL LIST THE JOBNAMES OF MAJOR AND MINOR      *
*        QNAMES. THIS CAN BE STARTED THRU PARM INPUT OR THE           *
*        OUTSTANDING WTOR.                                            *

*        THIS PROGRAM ISSUES A WTOR. THE REPLIES ALLOWED ARE:         *
*        'RESET' TO CLEAR ALL THE ACCUMULATED DATA AND START OVER.    *
*        'END' TO END THIS RUN,                                       *
*        'TRACE OFF' TO STOP CURRENT TRACING OUTPUT                   *
*        'TRACE ON,XXXX,XXXXX,XXX,...'  TO START TRACING SPECIFIED    *
*            QNAMES, XXXX = QNAME OR 'ALL' (IF ALL QNAMES WANTED)     *
*                                                                     *
*        THE CONSTANT 'MINIMAL' IS THE RESERVE THRESHOLD TIME.        *
*        RESERVES SMALLER THAN THIS INTERVAL WILL BE IGNORED.         *
*                                                                     *
*        THE SAMPLING INTERVAL VARIES FROM A MINIMUM OF 'INTVLOW' TO  *
*        A MAXIMUM OF 'INTVLHI' BY ' INTVLRTE'. THESE ARE ALL         *
*        ADJUSTABLE VALUES. THE QCB CHAIN IS ONLY SAMPLED WHEN        *
*        'QCBINTVL' IS GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO 'BINTVL'.             *
*                                                                     *
