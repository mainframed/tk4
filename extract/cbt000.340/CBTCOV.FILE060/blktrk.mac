                           BLKTRK

         CALCULATE BLOCKS PER TRACK FROM BLKSIZE & DEVTYPE
         OR CALCULATE MAX BLKSIZE FROM BLOCKS PER TRACK & DEVTYPE

         CALLING PARAMETERS:

         PARM1 - 5 HALFWORDS OF DATA
               HALFWORD1 - BLKSIZE TO BE USED
               HALFWORD2 - KEY LENGTH TO BE USED (0 IF UNKEYED)
               HALFWORD3 - BLOCKS PER TRACK TO BE USED OR 0
               HALFWORD4 - RETURN AREA FOR UNUSED BYTES
               HALFWORD5 - A POSITIVE NUMBER WILL BE THE FORTRAN
                           UNIT NUMBER, ZERO WILL SAY PARM2
                           IS A DDNAME (8 BYTES), -1 WILL SAY
                           PARM2 IS 5 WORDS OF DEVTYPE DATA.

         PARM2 - DDNAME, DEVTYPE DATA OR OMITTED AS REQUIRED
                 BY PARM1.

         RETURN CODES:
               0 - HALFWORD3 IN PARM1 HAS BLOCKS PER TRACK
               4 - DDNAME NOT FOUND
               8 - DDNAME OR DEVTYPE IS NOT DASD
               12 - HALFWORD5 IS INVALID

         CONTROL:
         IF HALFWORD3 IS 0, THEN KEYLEN, BLKSIZE, AND
         DEVTYPE ARE USED TO CALCULATE BLOCKS PER TRACK.
         IF HALFWORD3 IS NOT 0 THEN KEYLEN, DEVTYPE, AND
         HALFWORD3 ARE USED TO CALCULATE THE MAXIMUM
         BLKSIZE WHICH WILL GIVE THAT MANY BLOCKS PER TRACK.

         ALGORITHM:
         THE TRACK LENGTH IS EXTENDED BY DEVICE TOLERANCE AND
         DIFFERENCE IN BLOCK/LAST BLOCK OVERHEAD AS APPLICABLE.
         THE BLKSIZE, KEYLEN, DEVICE TOLERANCE AND OVERHEAD
         FACTORS (O/T LAST BLOCK) ARE USED TO CALCULATE
         EFFECTIVE BLOCK LENGTH WHICH IS THEN DIVIDED INTO
         THE EXTENDED TRACK LENGTH. THE QUOTIENT IS BLOCKS PER
         TRACK AND THE REMAINDER IS UNUSED BYTES ON THE TRACK.
