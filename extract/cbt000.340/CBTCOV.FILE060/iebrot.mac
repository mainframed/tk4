    NEW UTILITY IEBROT
+   __________________
-     IEBROT is a new utility developed at Leaside  Data  Centre.  It is
    designed exclusively for use on the 3800 Printing Subsystem.  As you
    are aware, the 3800 is normally loaded with  11  x  81"  stock  tab,
+                                                        2
    which  serves a variety of printouts.   There are times however when
    an alternate size is desired.  One of  the  most  popular  alternate
    sizes  is  81 x 11";  that is, 81" wide by 11" long.  The content of
+               2                   2  ____        ____
    this, is almost invariably text, for program documentation, letters,
    and the like.  Since this stock is not available, (and  even  if  it
+                                                     q
    were, would be too  costly to load) the utility IEBROT, and its spe-
+                                     q
    cially designed character sets were developed.
0     IEBROT reads your text, and rotates the matrix of each page ninety
    degrees.  Then, using its own special 90. character set, prints  the
+                                           o
    rotated images.  The character set is a weighted (serif) style, well
    suited to text applications.  The layout would be similar to that of
    a typewriter.  The appearance is  of  twelve  characters  per  inch,
    horizontal, six lines per inch, vertical.
-   IEBROT is easy to use:
+   ______________________
0     Your input text must be LRECL=80, RECFM=FA or FBA; that is, an ASA
    character, followed by 79 bytes of text data.   The  maximum  number
    of logical  lines  per page is 60.  When your text is ready, a cata-
    logued procedure is available:
0     //x EXEC IEBROT,IDSN='my.data.set'
0              - or -
0     //x EXEC IEBROT,IDSN='my.data.set',COPIES=n
0   if more than one copy of the printed output is needed.  ("n" is  the
    number of copies needed, up to 255.)
0     The  JOB statement for your run must override the JES2 feature for
    automatic skip to head-of-form after 60 lines.  To  do  this  code a
    value  of  90  or  greater  in  the  "page control" parameter of the
    accounting field.  eg: //xyz JOB (access,b#,,,,,,,90),'prog name',..

-   Standard Features:
+   __________________
0   ¯ IEBROT  and  its  character  sets  support  all graphics on the TN
      (IBM 1403) and the T-11 (IBM 3211) print trains.  These are  docu-
      mented  on  the  "yellow  card"  (System/370  Reference  Summary).
      Briefly stated, the graphics are:
      A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
      a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z

+                                       2  ≥  ≥  ˆ  ˆ
1   ¯ IEBROT recognizes any of the standard following ASA space  control
    characters:
0          Code    Action before printing line
+          ____    ___________________________
           blank   Space 1 line

           +       Suppress space (overprint)
           1       Skip to top of next page
    All other codes are treated as a blank (space 1 line).
0     Overprinting with multiple lines (using the "+" ASA code on subse-
    quent  lines)  is supported in the same manner as standard 3800 out-
    put.  An internal merge is performed by IEBROT before  matrix  rota-
    tion.

       either the first character given, or a very special  character as
       documented in "Special Features", below.
1   Special Features:
+   _________________
0   ¯ IEBROT and its character set distinguish between an opening  quote
    and a closing quote.  IEBROT will use the opening quote if the char-
    acter preceeding the quote is either a space or opening parenthesis,
    or is at the beginning of a line.  The closing quote is used in  all
    other  cases.   The  use  of  the quote marks for ditto marks is not
    recommended.  The logic used, presents a problem only when an under-
    score as a meaningful character is quoted.  Compare the text:
0   - - - The "X" Switch - - -
+         ______________
0           - to -
0   - - - The Special Character "_" ... - - -
0   If IEBROT chooses the wrong quote, overprint the first with  another
    and the choice will be reversed.
0   ¯ IEBROT  will convert the sequence open-parenthesis/close-parenthe-
    sis (( ) (except without a space)) to a check-box:  ().
+       r    q                      qr
0   ¯ The print trains TN/T-11 contain some format characters,  but  not
    "T"  intersections.   Pre-processing  packages  (text  editors) that
    think they are feeding a TN or T-11 train  typically  overprint  the
    graphics  that  are  present to create "T" intersections.  Thus, a ø
    overprinted by a ≥ or a ® produced a ø.  IEBROT handles all  logical
+                                        ®
    combinations of these characters for "ø" intersections.
+                                         ˆ
0   ¯ IEBROT converts a string of continuous hyphens (two  or  more)  to
    extended  dashes.  This gives easy access to a long dash for punctu-
    ation -- or for format characters.
0   ¯ IEBROT converts a vertical column of logical or's (two or more) to
    to a continuous vertical line.  This is useful  for  format  charac-
    ters.
0   ¯ If,  for  a  given page, both of the preceeding conditions are de-
+          __________________  ____
    tected by IEBROT, and the sequence dash-quote (ø")  is  not  present
+                     ___                                   ___
    the  Graphics  Completion  Module  is  invoked  for that page.  This
    examines all hyphens, extended dashes, and  logical  or's,  and,  if
    a  junction character is determined to be needed, it is used instead
    of the original format character.  The examples following,  on  this
    page,  contained  in  the  IEBROT input, only hyphens and or's.  The
    printed output shows the results of only the preceeding two rules on
    these characters.
0   ----------    ◊--------◊    ---------    -----------------------
    ◊  All   ◊    ◊        ◊    ◊ ◊ ◊   ◊    ◊   ◊   ◊       ------◊

    ----------    ◊--------◊    ----◊----    ------------◊----------
0     Because the sequence (ø") is also contained on this page, Graphics
    Completion is not invoked for it, but . . .
1   ...  on this page, where the proper rules are satisfied, the identi-
    cal input to IEBROT produces:
0   ----------    ◊--------◊    ---------    -----------------------
    ◊  All   ◊    ◊        ◊    ◊ ◊ ◊   ◊    ◊   ◊   ◊       ------◊

    ----------    ◊--------◊    ----◊----    ------------◊----------
0   You may notice, it even corrects  the  occasional  wrong  character.
0   There are some limitations, as IEBROT must do  some  second-guessing
  as  to  which  intersection  character  is  needed; unexpected results
  typically occur only when  there  are  adjacent  columns  of  or's  or
  consecutive  lines  of  hyphens/extended-dashes.   IEBROT deliberately
  does not alter "peninsula characters", for instance a line of  hyphens
  followed  by  an isolated "or", as this might be part of the text.  If
  Graphics Completion should fail to produce the needed junction,  manu-
  ally code the correct character in the input.
0   ¯ Merge Logic for Special Characters.
0   NOTE:  The merge logic described below is a feature  of  IEBROT.  It
+   _____
    is  not  a  standard feature of the 3800 Printing Subsystem, itself.
+       ____________________________________
    Do not attempt to do this if you are not using IEBROT.
0   . It is often desirable to use an occasional very special character.
+   .                                            ____
    These  are  not easily available using either TSO or SPF.  IEBROT is
    designed so that certain logical combinations  of  characters  over-
    printing  each  other  will result in a totally different character.
    For instance, the degree sign, which cannot be keyed  directly  from
    most  TSO  keyboards  can  be "printed" by the appropriate coding to
    "print" a period, "overprinted" by an O.  Of course the  text  could
    have  contained  the  true  degree sign, hexadecimal A1.  This "over
    printing" is accomplished in the same manner as with line  printers,
    using ASA control codes; the subsequent line(s) to be merged contain
    + as their ASA character.  Thus:
0                     The 90. Print Program ....
0                        - "overprinted" by -
0                    +      o
0                        - "overprinted" by -
0                    +    ___       _______
0                           - results in -
0                     The 90. Print Program ....
+                           o
+                         ___       _______
0   In this case the text was also underlined.  Note  that  if  this  is
    desired, the underscores must be in the final line.
1     The complete specification for very special characters is given in
    Table 1.

-   Restrictions:
+   _____________
0     IEBROT does not support OPTCD=J type input.  This is under  consi-
    deration for the future.

+                               ____
    without abending, however records shorter that this will give unspe-
    cified output, and records longer will be truncated.
0     IEBROT's output cannot be allocated to an adequate SYSOUT directly
    by a TSO session.  The necessary parameters  for  the  3800  special
    features  required  cannot be specified by TSO allocate.  Of course,
    batch jobs submitted under TSO will work.

    (latter) line.
0     Do not attempt to edit IEBROT's output.  The co-ordination between
    the printed results and the EBCDIC codes used does  not  necessarily
    conform to System/370 Architecture.
0     The only character sets supported at present are  J0S1  and  J0SA.
    Use of others will give unspecified results.  Using J0S1 or J0SA for
    other than IEBROT output will look most singular, and not altogether
    pleasant.
0     FCB specifications of other than 12 LPI will  give  unsatisfactory
    results.  (6 LPI for the big-print version.)
0     The One-Half Sign and the format characters may not be underlined.
-   Troubleshooting:
+   ________________
0   Problem:  Left  two  thirds  of page appears on one sheet; right one
    third appears on subsequent sheet.
    Solution:  Check the JOB statement for  a  specification  of  90  or
    greater  lines  per  page  before  the JES2 automatic page overflow.
    There  should  be  a  total  of  8  commas  before  this  parameter.
+                         _____      _          ______
0   Problem:  First line of page is too close to the edge of the  paper.
    Solution:  After  each skip to a new page, insert a few blank lines.
0   Problem:  Starting  new  page  where  not  indicated  with ASA code.
    Solution:  IEBROT will  generate  a  new  page  condition  after  60
    logical  lines  if  no  ASA code is found in time.  Check your text.
0   Problem:  Output from IEBROT looks really weird when printed on  RJE
    terminal or 3211.
    Solution:  Output is normal.  Correct person who asked for it.
0   Problem:  Output from IEBROT is all capitals.
    Solution:  Input is all upper case.
-   Costs:
+   ______
0     Bear in mind that IEBROT is  a  utility,  not  just  a  convenient
    switch  on the 3800 Printing Subsystem.  Compared with "straight up"
    utilities, such as IEBDUP, cost of running a  given  print  job  may
    vary.  The ratio of this variance is highly dependent on the content
    of  the text.  IEBROT must write a physical print line for each ver-
    tical column of text.  The  percentage  of  columns  containing  all
    blanks  (including  margins)  will  influence the number of physical
    lines (more blanks yield fewer lines).  When using an accounting al-
    gorithm based on  number-of-lines  printed,  typical  text  (program
    documentaion, memos &c.), one can expect an increase of approximate-
    ly 40%  over using normal printing via IEBDUP.  However, if handling
    "tall, skinny" text, cost may be even less than IEBDUP.
1   IEBIGROT
+   ________
0     IEBROT can alternately produce a large style print.  This is  four
    times  the  normal  size.  It is useful for overhead-projection mas-
    ters, printing for those with impaired vision, or  other  large-type
    publishing.
0     To  the  using programmer, there is little difference.  The master
    installation has two  catalogued  procedures,  IEBROT  and  IEBIGROT
    which  co-ordinate  the  specifications.  IEBROT is still the master
    program and it is used in the same manner as usual,  with  the  fol-
    lowing differences:
0   ¯ JES  control does not need to override to 90 lines per page.  Con-
    trol > 45 is adequate.
+        =
0   ¯ The number of logical lines per (rotated) page is 30.
+                   _______
0   ¯ The  total  print  width  is  45  positions.  I.E.  Total  useable
    LRECL=46 including ASA.  Shorter LRECL's  give  unspecified  output;
    longer are truncated.
0   ¯ The  open-parenthesis/close-parenthesis  sequence does not produce
    a check-box.
0   ¯ The J.C.L. (normally controlled by the catalogued  procedure)  now
    specifies  PARM='/UPSI(00010000)'  (or  DOS equivalent), CHARS=J0SA,
    and FCB=8@6.
-   ¯ All other special features -- full upper/lower case, special char-
    acters, underscoring, merging, Graphic Completion function correctly
0   ¯ The  big  print  version  cannot  give  output intermixed with the
    normal output of IEBROT.   DO  NOT  mess  around.   DO  NOT  specify
+                                                       _______
    CHARS=(J0S1,J0SA);  you  will  exceed  the  capacity of the 3800 and
    lose your job output!
0   NOTE:  If you intend to have fine quality output from  this  feature
    (I.E.  final document version), it is suggested that you co-ordinate
    your printing with the print-area supervisor.  If  the  3800  photo-
    conductor  is  overdue to be refreshed, print contrast may not be as
    good as you expect.
1   Performance Considerations
+   __________________________
0     IEBROT is written in VS COBOL and Assembler.  It is  not  downward
    compatible  to  ANS  V4, or V3.  Optimization by the CAPEX OPTIMIZER
    results in a reduction of the number of instructions to 50%  of  the
    IBM  compiler output.  Other installations wanting to install IEBROT
    are urged to use OPTIMIZER; other specifications noted below use the
    optimized program.
0     IEBROT is very CPU efficient.  It was designed with an AMDAHL  CPU
    in  mind.   Other  CPU's using a long pipeline technique may benefit
    accordingly.  The MERGE logic (processing of "overprint"  lines)  is
    considered to be non-critical path; text involving extensive merging
    will require increased CPU time.  Text for the large  character  set
    also  requires  some  additional  time.  For typical text, on a 168,
    allow 1 minute of CPU time per 2,000 pages.
0     Character  set  J0S1 requires imagelib members XTB1J0S1, GRAFJ0S1,
    GRAFJ0S2, GRAFJ0S3.  J0S1 is a "fast load" (CGMID=FF)  image,  occu-
    pying  three  WCGM's.   Installations  having only two WCGM's may be
    able to pare down J0S1 by removing a few of the more baroque special
    characters; the third WCGM contains only 16  segments  currently.  A
    suitable FCB for 12 LPI, 90 lines minimum must also be present.
0     Character  set  J0SA  requires   XTB1J0SA,   GRAFJ0SA,   GRAFJ0SB,
    GRAFJ0SC  and GRAFJ0SD.  It too, is fast-load.  A suitable FCB for 6
    LPI must be present.
0     IEBROT  runs in an address space of 40K, plus allowance for buffer
    space.  When TSO ALLOCATE is improved to  allow  access  to  special
    features of  the 3800, IEBROT will run under TSO.  Aside from normal
    I/O, IEBROT uses no other COBOL features known to be  prohibited  by
    C.I.C.S.  Conversion to DOS should be possible.
0     Modification  of  IEBROT  by  other  installations is ill-advised.
    However, if done, it should be very  carefully  documented.   Future
    releases  of  IEBROT  which are planned will always have regenerated
    sequence numbers, and may even have  their  paragraph-names  renamed
    and  rearranged.   The  3800  Printing Subsystem architecture should
    be thoroughly understood.
-   Future Plans:
+   _____________
0     There are future plans for IEBROT in the following areas:
0   .  Capability  to  accept  OPTCD=J type input to control equivalency
+   .
       of FM12.  Format characters will become incorporated into J0S1 or
       its equivalent alternate.  As an alternative, the equivalency  of
       GS12, for special use such as a CODE listing (JCL examples, &c.).
0   .  Capability to accept machine code (RECFM=xxM) characters,  or  no
+   .
       space control characters at all.
0   .  Alternative character set to J0S1, in a more modern style.
+   .
0   .  Special  ditto  marks,  paragraph sign, section sign, arrows, ac-
+   .
       cented letters to accomodate most Romance and Germanic languages.
0   .  Subscripts.
+   .
-     There are no plans for the following areas:
+               __
0   .  APL characters or extra mathematical symbols.
+   .
0   .  Italics.
+   .
0   .  A complete assembler re-write.
+   .
0   .  Allowing for a variable page matrix size.
+   .
0   .  Giving IEBROT any capability that would make it difficult or con-
+   .
       fusing to use.
0   .  Printing in red, green or peuce.  Printing in white on white  for
+   .
       high security documents is a possibility.
-   Installation of IEBROT:
+   _______________________
0     This author  has  never  seen  any  package  installed  that  went
    according to the usual copiously detailed instructions supplied.  In
    all cases, intervention of a reasonably intelligent systems program-
    mer was necessary.  Installation of IEBROT assumes the pre-existence
    of  such  a  person, and that he knows better than I how he wants to
    install IEBROT, given a few general guidelines.
0     Distribution of the package occurs as one of several cases.
0     Case A:  Direct  from  Leaside  Data  Centre  (Canada only!).  The
    distribution tape is STANDARD LABELLED, VOL=SER=DONUT1.  It is  6250
    BPI (1600 available).  It contains four sequential files as follows:
0     1)  The Documentation you are reading.
          DSN=IEBROT.F1
          DCB=(LRECL=80,RECFM=FBA,BLKSIZE=800)
          This will likely have to be edited to suit  the  installation,
          if  you  intend  to publish the first few pages as local usage
          instructions.  Print only using the product,  once  installed.
0     2)  The  Assembler source for IEBROT's called modules.  Assemble &
          optionally link, depending on your link  techniques  for  (3).
          This  is  a single CSECT with three entry points.  Name member
          "IEBROTA1" for autolink, later.
          DSN=IEBROT.F2
          DCB=(LRECL=80,RECFM=FB,BLKSIZE=800)
          Sequence numbers in 73 through 80.
0     3)  COBOL source for IEBROT.  Compile and link to taste; you  will
          need  one  include card for the link step, if Assembler is not
          named "IEBROTA1" from step 2.
          DSN=IEBROT.F3
          DCB=(LRECL=80,RECFM=FB,BLKSIZE=800)
          Sequence numbers in 1 through 6.
0     4)  The IEBIMAGE source for the rotated character set; allow space
          for roughly 6,000 statements.
          DSN=IEBROT.F4
          DCB=(LRECL=80,RECFM=FB,BLKSIZE=800)
          Sequence numbers in 73 through 80.
          This is one continuous stream for three Graphic modules,  fol-
          lowed  by  a  Character Arrangement Table definition.  This is
          for the normal print.  Following this are  four  more  Graphic
          modules  and  another  XTB  for  the big-print variation.  Run
          through IEBIMAGE.  All names are as xxxxJ0Sy, no replace.
0     Case B:  Indirect from another installation.  They should  outline
    the  format  of the tape.  The tasks should be similar to the above.
    Acquisition of IEBROT in this manner is not wise, since it is impos-
    sible for the home centre to advise of new releases.
0     Case C:  From GUIDE.  Specifications forthcoming;  presumably a la
    IEBCOPY.
0     After the basic installation above, you will need  to  verify  the
    presence of FCB's for 8.5 inches, one for 12 LPI, one for 6 LPI.
0     Catalogued procedures are highly recommended.  Models:
0          //IEBROT   PROC IDSN=NULLFILE,COPIES=1
           //stepname EXEC PGM=IEBROT,REGION=40K (plus buffers)
           //STEPLIB  DD   as appropriate
           //SYSUT1   DD   DSN=&IDSN,DISP=SHR
           //SYSUT2   DD   SYSOUT=*,CHARS=J0S1,FCB=8@12,COPIES=&COPIES
           //         PEND
0          //IEBIGROT PROC IDSN=NULLFILE,COPIES=1
           //stepname EXEC PGM=IEBROT,REGION=40K, (plus buffers)
           //             PARM='/UPSI(00010000)'
           //STEPLIB  DD   as appropriate
           //SYSUT1   DD   DSN=&IDSN,DISP=SHR
           //SYSUT2   DD   SYSOUT=*,CHARS=J0SA,FCB=8@6,COPIES=&COPIES
           //         PEND
0          In both cases, FCB names are examples.
0     Test out the product by printing the documentation on the tape.
-   A Slightly Rounder Wheel:
+   _________________________
0     The author of IEBROT acknowledges existence of the IUP "IBM 3800 -
    90 Degree Print Program", Program Number 5796-ARE which also does 90
    degree printing.  He salutes the authors of that package who had the
    broad minded thinking to introduce the concept, and the fortitude to
    spend those late nights coding all those characters.
0     IEBROT  is  not intended as a replacement for "ROTATE90" which has
    some flexibilities never intended for IEBROT.  ROTATE90  is  clearly
    superior  for "computer report" type printing where a condensed for-
    mat is desired.
1   A Few Notes to the Supporting Programmer:
+   _________________________________________
0     IEBROT and ROTATE90 are impossibly incompatible.  Don't attempt to
    mix  their  respective  outputs  and character designs.  In order to
    achieve the appearance of the printing that IEBROT produces,  a  few
    sacred  cows  had  to be ignored.  The effective appearance of 6 LPI
    from IEBROT/J0S1 is the result of using  as  each  "logical"  output
    "cell"  a composite character composed of one physical 10-pitch cell
    plus one physical 15-pitch cell.  In many cases this  15-pitch  cell
    serves  only to provide the spacing portion between lines; in others
    it will contain an underscore, a descender for Q g j p q y,  certain
    obscure  special  characters,  or  a  combination  of underscore and
    descender.  These descenders use "undefined" (non-printable)  EBCDIC
    codes.  The  big-print  version uses for each character, four cells:
    two 10-pitch for the main part; two  15-pitch  for  descenders.  The
    concept is similar.
0     J0S1  is  likely to come under attack by the technocrats amoung us
    for not using a modern type-style.  J0S1 is modelled after  a  style
    "Century  Schoolbook"; it is not an exact copy.  It was not modelled
    after "Helvetica" because although it  may  be  highly  readable  to
    those  who  don't  own  a hardcover book, it is also the most boring
    type face created since the dawn  of  inscription.   If  anyone  out
    there knows of a good basic model for the planned more modern style,
    this author sincerely invites them to contact him.
0     If one attempts to contruct fairly complex diagrams using Graphics
    Completion, it is wise to try to understand the logic.  If the  rou-
    tine is involked, the unrotated page matrix is examined character by
    character,  left  to  right on each line, top to bottom on the page.
    When a hyphen, dash or "or" is found, it has the chance  to  be  al-
    tered;  no  other characters (including native corners etc.) will be
    changed.  Having found an appropriate  character,  the  matrix  sur-
    rounding  it  is examined: left, above, right, below.  At that point
    IEBROT first examines, what neighbouring characters are pointing  to
+          _____                                                      __
    the  current  character;  this is more important that whether or not
    the current character is pointing to  its  neighbours.  For  further
    detail, consult the COBOL coding.

1     Updated character sets for the  3800 mod 3  are included.
0     The 3800 model 3 character sets were fashioned from the GS12
    character set, plus GL12 located elsewhere on the users group tape.
0     Character  set  J0S1 requires imagelib members XTB1J0S1,
    GRF2J0S1, GRF2J0S2, GRF2J0S3.
    (NOTE: XTB1J0S1 is the same for 3800 mod 1 and 3800 mod 3).
0     Also, a script character set (JSR1) has been created for the
    "normal" IEBROT. It isn't perfect for several reasons, but, is an
    attempt to keep IEBROT useable.  JSR1 requires imagelib members
    XTB1JSR1, GRF2JSR1, GRF2JSR2 and GFR2JSR3.
0     We have found symbolics very helpful in using IEBROT.  Our PROCs
    look like:

0   with the only differences for IEBIGROT being the graphic, CHARS
    symbolic and the added parameter.  The reason for the graphic came
    at my last installation where we had online COM, it is eyeball
    readable at 48X.
