This program produces a formatted condensed listing of CICS RDO
information.  It calls the IBM program DFHCSDUP, and then reads its
output.  It extracts certain fields from the output, and then formats
them in a more human-readable way.

The source for the program RDOFMT, which is in PL/I, can be found in
the source file on this tape, while the JCL required to run it,
RDOFMTX, is in the cntl file.
