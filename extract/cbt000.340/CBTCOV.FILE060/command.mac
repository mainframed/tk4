*     THIS PROGRAM ACCEPTS SYSTEM OR JES OPERATOR COMMANDS AS         *
*     INPUT AND EXECUTES THEM USING SVC 34. IT MUST BE APF            *
*     AUTHORIZED.                                                     *

*                                                                     *
*     1) BATCH OR CALLED PROGRAM                                      *
*        IN THIS MODE COMMAND ACCEPTS INPUT AS EITHER 80-BYTE         *
*        CARD IMAGES FROM SYSIN OR A SINGLE COMMAND FROM THE PARM     *
*        FIELD. THE RESPONSE TO THE OPERATOR COMMAND WILL             *
*        APPEAR ON ALL OPERATOR CONSOLES. FOR EXAMPLE:                *
*                                                                     *

*        IF COMMANDS ARE FETCHED FROM SYSIN, A DELAY OF 2 SECONDS     *
*        WILL BE ADDED BETWEEN COMMANDS.                              *
*                                                                     *
*     2) TSO COMMAND PROCESSOR                                        *
*        IN THIS MODE COMMAND EXPECTS TO FIND THE OPERATOR COMMAND    *
*        DIRECTLY FOLLOWING ON THE TSO INPUT LINE. THE RESPONSE TO    *
*        OS COMMANDS WILL THEN BE DISPLAYED ON THE TSO TERMINAL.      *
*        RESPONSE TO JES COMMANDS WILL APPEAR ON YOUR TERMINAL        *
*        PROVIDED A LOCAL MODIFICATION IS MADE TO JES2 TO ALLOW       *
*        IT TO INTERCEPT THE COMMAND AND SET THE RESPONSE TO TSO.     *
*        OTHERWISE, JES2 COMMANDS WILL APPEAR ON ALL CONSOLES.        *
*        FOR EXAMPLE:                                                 *
*                                                                     *

*        IN THIS MODE COMMAND ACCEPTS INPUT ACCORDING TO STANDARD     *
*        OS LINKAGE CONVENTIONS. IN ADDITION TO THE COMMAND ITSELF,   *
*        A SECOND PARAMETER MAY BE PASSED WHICH CONTAINS THE          *
*        CONSOLE NUMBER WHERE YOU WISH THE RESPONSE TO APPEAR.        *
*        (THE SVC 34 WILL ALSO ASSUME THE AUTHORITY OF THAT           *
*        CONSOLE.) FOR EXAMPLE:                                       *
