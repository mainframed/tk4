         MODIFICATIONS:
         --------------
        FIVE NEW MODULES HAVE BEEN WRITTEN TO PERFORM THESE FUNCTIONS-



        GTF MODIFICATIONS ARE IN TWO MODULES -

        GTFCCW     THIS IS THE TRACE INITIALIZATION MODULE.  IT
                   SEPARATES THE CCWTRACE PARAMETERS IN THE PARM= INPUT
                   STRING FROM THE PARMS TO BE PASSED TO NORMAL GTF
                   STARTUP. WHEN PARAMETER PROCESSING IS COMPLETE,
                   CONTROL PASSES TO AHLGTF TO PERFORM THE STANDARD
                   INITIALIZATION.

        GTFSIO     THIS MODULE IS LINKED TOGETHER WITH THE STANDARD
                   MODULE AHLTSIO. BY USE OF THE LINKAGE EDITOR CHANGE
                   CONTROL STATEMENT, THE ENTRY POINTS AHLTIO AND
                   AHLTSIO1 ARE ROUTED TO THE CORRESPONDING GTFSIO
                   ENTRY POINTS. FROM THESE, GTFSIO WILL BALR TO THE
                   AHLTSIO FUNCTIONS. ON RETURN, GTFSIO PERFORMS CCW
                   AND DATA TRACING, AS FAR AS THE FUNCTIONS ARE
                   SELECTED.
                   THIS MODULE HAS ALIASES OF AHLTIO, AHLTUIO, AHLTSIO1,
                   AND AHLTSIO AND AN ENTRY STATEMENT FOR GTFSIO.



        PRINT-DUMP MODIFICATIONS ARE IN THREE MODULES

        AMDSYS00   THIS IS AN INTERFACE MODULE.  IT CHECKS TO SEE IF
                   MODULE GTFCCWPR IS IN THE LLE CHAIN.  IF SO,
                   IT PASSES CONTROL TO GTFCCWPR TO PERFORM THE EDIT
                   FUNCTION.  IF NOT, CONTROL PASSES TO AMDSYS0S,
                   THE STANDARD GTF FORMAT ROUTINE.

        GTFPRINT   THIS MODULE LOADS THE MODULES AMDSYS0S, GTFCCWPR,
                   AND THE TRANSLATION ROUTINE IF SPECIFIED. AFTER
                   PROVIDING AMDPRDMP PARMS, IT LINKS TO AMDPRDMP.

        GTFCCWPR   THIS MODULE COMPLEMENTS THE NORMAL IO AND SIO PRINT
                   MODULE AMDSYS00, THAT IS RENAMED TO AMDSYS0S.  IT
                   FORMATS THE CCWTRACE RECORDS . FOR NORMAL RECORDS IT
                   STILL USES AMDSYS0S (AMDSYS00).
1                                                               PAGE 04




          HOW TO INSTALL
          --------------
 INSTALLATION CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING STEPS, SOME OF WHICH ARE
 DEPENDENT ON WHETHER OR NOT YOU HAVE ONE OF THE PREVIOUS VERSIONS
 OF GTF CCWTRACE INSTALLED OR NOT. YOU MAY USE A SET OF SAMPLE JCL
 CONTAINED IN FILE12 OF THIS VOLUME. PUNCH IT OUT AND MODIFY IT
 ACCORDIG TO YOUR REQUIREMENTS. MAKE SURE, THAT PREVIOUS VERSIONS
 OF GTFCCW ARE ACCEPTED, BEFORE STARTING TO INSTALL A NEW VERSION.
 ALSO ACCEPT ANY SU, THAT MODIFIES EITHER AMDSYS00 OR AHLTSIO.

   1)  ADD A NEW PROCEDURE TO SYS1.PROCLIB
   2)  ADD GTFCCW TO THE PROGRAM PROPERTIES TABLE (PPT)
   3)  PREPARE THE LPALIB AND LINKLIB
   4)  RUN SMP TO INSTALL MODIFICATIONS
   5)  RE-IPL THE SYSTEM WITH CLPA





   1)  ADD THE NEW PROCEDURE TO SYS1.PROCLIB
       -------------------------------------

       A SAMPLE PROCEDURE IS ON FILE 5 OF THE TAPE.  THE FOLLOWING
       JOB CAN BE USED TO ADD IT TO YOUR PROCLIB.

     //ST9999TU JOB (0,1100,10,9),'W.BAUR',MSGCLASS=A
     //STEP1   EXEC PGM=IEBGENER
     //*
     //*****************************************************
     //*                                                   *
     //*   UPDATE GTFCCW PROCEDURE                         *
     //*                                                   *
     //*****************************************************
     //*
     //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=A
     //SYSIN    DD DUMMY
     //SYSUT2   DD DSN=SYS1.PROCLIB(GTFCCW),DISP=SHR
     //SYSUT1   DD UNIT=TAPE,LABEL=(5,NL),VOL=SER=CCWTRC,
     //         DCB=(RECFM=FB,BLKSIZE=400,LRECL=80,DEN=3),DISP=OLD

          TOGETHER WITH PROCLIB UPDATE, CHECK THE SU=XXXX PARM IN THE
          GIVEN PROCEDURE. CORRECT IT, AS EXPLAINED TOGETHER WITH THE
          PARAMETER DESCRIPTION OF GTFCCW. UNPREDICTABLE RESULTS MAY
          OCCUR, IF YOU START GTFCCW WITH WRONG SU PARM. SU=0000 IS
          CODED IN THE GIVEN PROCEDURE.

          PLEASE NOTE, THAT IT IS A RESTRICTION OF GTF, THAT IT HAS TO
          BE STARTED FROM THE CONSOLE. TIME=1440 MUST ALSO BE CODED,
          AS IT IS IN THE SAMPLE PROCEDURE.


1                                                               PAGE 05
-

   2)  ADD GTFCCW TO THE PPT
       ---------------------

       NOTE:  IF YOU ALREADY HAVE GTF CCWTRACE VERSION 2.0 OR HIGHER
              IN YOUR SYSTEM, THIS STEP CAN BE IGNORED.


       THE PPT IS IN LPALIB AS PART OF MODULE IEFSD060.  THE CSECT
       NAME IS IEFSDPPT.  THE SOURCE IS LOCATED IN SYS1.AMODGEN AS
       MEMBER SGIEF0PT.

       IT IS NECESSARY TO MAKE AN ENTRY FOR MODULE 'GTFCCW' IN
       THE PPT.  IT SHOULD HAVE THE SAME ATTRIBUTES AS AHLGTF,
       I.E., X'E800FFFF'.  IF THE PPT FOR SOME REASON CANNOT BE
       EXPANDED, THE ENTRY FOR HHLGTF OR IHLGTF ALREADY HAS THE
       CORRECT ATTRIBUTES AND CAN BE OVERWRITTEN AS GTFCCW.

       ALTERNATIVELY, MEMBER SGIEF0PT CAN BE UPDATED VIA SMP BY
       USING THE FOLLOWING SKELETON SMP STATEMENTS WITH YOUR
       OWN PROCEDURE:

          //SMPPTFIN  DD  *
          ++ PTF (LZ90000) .
          ++ UPDTE (SGIEF0PT) .
          ./ CHANGE NAME=SGIEF0PT
          ****   ASSEMBLER LANGUAGE UPDATES TO ADD GTFCCW
          ****   USE AHLGTF AS AN EXAMPLE (IT IS ALREADY THERE)
          ./ ENDUP
          //SMPCNTL  DD  *
            RECEIVE.
            APPLY S (LZ90000) .
          /*


        NOTE: THE PPT FORMAT IS DIFFERENT AS OF PTF UZ13109.
1                                                               PAGE 06
-
    3)  PREPARE THE LPALIB AND LINKLIB
        ------------------------------

        A) RENAME SOME OF THE MODULES IN THE LPALIB OR LINKLIB. EXPECT
           RETURN CODE OF IEHPROGM, IF EITHER ANY PREVIOUS VERSION WAS
           ALREADY INSTALLED OR VERSION 1.4 WAS NOT INSTALLED.

           //SCRCCW    JOB    ....  ETC  ....
           //STEP1  EXEC  PGM=IEHPROGM
           //* **************************************************
           //*
           //*  RENAME AMDSYS00 TO AMDSYS0S (IN LPALIB)
           //*  RENAME BHLGTF1 TO AHLGTF (IN LINKLIB)
           //*
           //* **************************************************
           //SYSPRINT  DD  SYSOUT=A
           //LPALIB    DD  VOL=REF=SYS1.LPALIB,DISP=OLD
           //LINKLIB   DD  VOL=REF=SYS1.LINKLIB,DISP=SHR
           //SYSIN     DD  *
            RENAME  DSNAME=SYS1.LPALIB,VOL=3350=SYSRES,          ******
                          MEMBER=AMDSYS00,NEWNAME=AMDSYS0S
            RENAME DSNAME=SYS1.LINKLIB,VOL=3350=SYSRES,          ******
                          MEMBER=BHLGTF1,NEWNAME=AHLGTF

        B) LINK AHLTSIO AS GTFSIO TO THE LPALIB, TO HAVE IT AVAILABLE
           FOR SMP.

           //STEP2  EXEC  LINKS,PARM='NCAL,LIST,XREF,AC=1,RENT,REUS',
           //       UNIT=3330,SER=SYSRES,NAME=LPALIB,P1=' ',
           //       N=SYS1,MOD=,P2=' ',OBJ=OBJPDS01,CLASS=A
           //AOS11  DD  DISP=SHR,VOLUME=(,RETAIN),DSNAME=SYS1.AOS11
           //SYSLIN DD  *
            CHANGE  AHLTIO(BHLTIO)
            CHANGE  AHLTSIO1(BHLTSIO1)
            INCLUDE AOS11(AHLTSIO)
            NAME GTFSIO(R)
           /*

        C) DELETE AHLTSIO FROM SYS1.PARMLIB(IEAPAKXX) (IF PRESENT) OR
           YOU WILL GET MESSAGE IEA357I AT CLPA.
1                                                               PAGE 07
-
       4)  LINK OF NEW MODULES
           -------------------

 //GRZ024   JOB (0,2),SYSPTF,TIME=9,MSGLEVEL=(1,1)
 //*  INSTALL GTFCCW WITH SMP
 //STEP1     EXEC  PGM=IEBGENER
 //SYSIN     DD  DUMMY

 //          DCB=(LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=400,RECFM=FB),DISP=(OLD,PASS)
 //SYSUT2    DD  UNIT=SYSDA,DSN=&&CNTLIN,DISP=(NEW,PASS),
 //          SPACE=(TRK,(5,1)),DCB=(LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=400,RECFM=FB)
 //STEP2     EXEC  PGM=IEBGENER
 //SYSIN     DD  DUMMY
 //SYSPRINT  DD  SYSOUT=A
 //SYSUT1    DD  UNIT=2400-3,LABEL=(3,NL),VOL=SER=CCWTRC,
 //          DCB=(LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=400,RECFM=FB),DISP=(OLD,PASS)
 //SYSUT2    DD  UNIT=SYSDA,DSN=&&JCLIN,DISP=(NEW,PASS),
 //          SPACE=(TRK,(5,1)),DCB=(LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=400,RECFM=FB)

 //           DCB=(LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=400,RECFM=FB)


       SMP WILL OPEN MORE THAN ONE DATASET AT A TIME, SO IT IS
       NECESSARY TO COPY THE CNTLIN AND JCLIN DATASETS FROM TAPE TO
       DISK BEFORE DOING AN SMP UPDATE.
       (STEPS 1 AND 2 IN THE ABOVE EXAMPLE.)
-
-
   6)  RE-IPL THE SYSTEM WITH CLPA
       ---------------------------

       GTFCCW IS READY FOR USE.


1                                                               PAGE 08
-
  SOME REGRESSION PROBLEMS. -
  ---------------------------

        SOME OR ALL OF THE MODULES INVOLVED MAY BE REGRESSED AFTER
        A NEW SYSGEN OR BY A SU INSTALLATION. MODULES AFFECTED
        ARE EITHER AMDSYS00 FOR AMDPRDMP OR AHLTSIO FOR AHLTGTF.
        REGRESSION MAY ALSO BE FOR THE PPT BY A NEW SYSGEN.
        ALSO THE SMPCDS MAY BE REGRESSED BY A JCLIN RUN WITH
        ANY SU OR PTF.
         A PTF INSTALLATION THAT REPLACES ANY OF THE INVOLVED
        MODULES (AMDSYS00 OR AHLTSIO) IS NOT A REGRESSION,
        EXCEPT THEY REQUIRE A JCLIN. FOR ALL THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS,
        IT IS RECOMMENDED, THAT GTFCCW HAS BEEN ACCEPTED BEFORE.

 1.) THE SMPCDS IS REGRESSED AFTER A JCLIN FOR A PTF OR A SU.
        GET THE CNTLIN DATASET USED IN THE INSTALLATION STEPS.
        REMOVE THE APPLY STATEMENT.
        RUN A UCLIN AND A JCLIN AS IN THE INSTALLATION PROCEDURE.
        THIS MAY BE DONE AT ANY TIME WITHOUT PROBLEMS.

 2.) ANY OF THE MODULES ARE REGRESSED (AHLTSIO, AMDSYS00).
        THIS MAY BE AFTER A NEW SYSGEN OR A SU INSTALLATION .

        GET THE JCLIN DATASET USED IN THE INSTALLATION STEPS.
        MODIFY IT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF YOUR INSTALLATION.
        RUN IT TO RELINK ALL MODULES AFFECTED.
        THIS MAY BE DONE AT ANY TIME WITHOUT PROBLEMS.

        AFTER THE LINK STEP, CHECK, IF MODULE AMDSYS00 IS PRESENT
        IN THE LPALIB. IF YES, SCRATCH IT. YOU HAVE JUST LINKED IT
        AS AMDSYS0S BY THE LINK STEP ABOVE.

 3.) CHECK IF THE PPT HAS BEEN REGRESSED. THAT MAY BE POSSIBLE
        AFTER A SYSGEN IF THE PPT WAS ZAPPED INSTEAD OF UPDATED.
        THE QUICKEST WAY, TO CHECK THIS, IS TO START GTFCCW.
        IF THE PPT ENTRY IS NOT AVAILABLE, YOU WILL GET MESSAGE T15.
        IF REQUIRED, REPEAT THE CORRESPONDING INSTALLATION STEP ABOVE.

 4.) CHECK, WETHER THE SU=XXXX PARAMETER IS STILL VALID IN YOUR
        START PROCEDURE. INVALID SU SPECIFICATION MAY GIVE
        UNPREDICTABLE RESULTS. REFER TO THE TEXT FOR PARAMETER
        'SUDATA' FOR GTFCCW IN THIS DESCRIPTION.

 5.) DO A CLPA BEFORE USING GTFCCW.

         HOW TO TRACE
         ------------
              THE GTFCCW TRACE IS STARTED IN THE SAME WAY AS THE
              STANDARD GTF (SEE GC28-0674).
              HOWEVER YOU MAY SELECT SOME ADDITIONAL OPTIONS WHICH
              BELONG ONLY TO THE CCW TRACE.

        THE FOLLOWING ARE THE KEYWORDS WHICH BELONG TO CCWTRACE ONLY
        ------------------------------------------------------------

        CCW=NNN                    DEFAULT=50
           =NO
                    NNN= INTEGER BETWEEN 1 AND 512
                         THIS IS THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF CCW'S TO BE
                         TRACED FOR ONE EVENT.

        DATA=NNNNN                 DEFAULT=24
            =NO
                  NNNNN= INTEGER BETWEEN 1 AND 32767
                         IF THE COUNT IN THE CCW IS GREATER THAN NNNNN,
                         THE FIRST HALF OF THE TRACED DATA IS FROM THE
                         START OF THE BUFFER AND THE SECOND HALF IS FROM
                         THE END OF THE BUFFER.

        IO=YES                     DEFAULT=YES
          =NO
        IO               IF 'YES' IS SPECIFIED OR DEFAULTED TO, I/O
                         INTERRUPTS WILL BE TRACED.
                         IF YOU CODE IO=NO, NO TRACING WILL TAKE PLACE
                         FOR I/O INTERRUPTS.

        IOSB=YES                   DEFAULT=NO
            =NO
        IOSB             THIS PARAMETER RESULTS IN TRACING OF IOSB
                         AND EWA, AS FAR AS AVAILABLE. HOWEVER, THIS
                         IS ONLY PERFORMED, IF THE SIO FUNCTION IS
                         ALSO ACTIVE. IF THIS PARAMETER IS OMITTED OR
                         IOSB=NO IS CODED, IOSB AND EWA TRACING IS
                         ONLY PERFORMED AS A RESULT OF AN GTFSIO ERROR.

        NO               THIS IS A DUMMY PARAMETER, THAT IS IGNORED BY
                         GTFCCW. IT MAY BE USEFUL IF YOU WORK WITH THE
                         SHORT FORM OF THE PARMS, AND YOU WANT TO
                         OVERWRITE THE KEYWORDS IN A PROCEDURE. NOTE
                         THAT PARM SIZE IS LIMITED TO 100.

        SIO=YES                    DEFAULT=NO
           =NO
        SIO              IF SIO=YES IS SPECIFIED, CCW (AND DATA)
                         TRACING WILL BE PERFORMED FOR SIO EVENTS.
                         IF YOU CODE SIO=NO, NO CCW TRACING WILL
                         TAKE PLACE FOR SIO'S.

        SMOD=YES                   DEFAULT=NO
            =NO
        SMOD             THE SMOD PARAMETER SPECIFIES WHAT ACTION IS
                         TO BE TAKEN WHEN STATUS MODIFIER IS PRESENT.
                         IF SMOD=NO IS SPECIFIED, THE TRACE ROUTINE
                         WILL IGNORE THE POSSIBILITY OF AN EXTENDED
                         CCW CHAIN.  IF SMOD=YES, THEN ALL TIC'S WILL
                         BE CHECKED FOR THE PRESENCE OF ANOTHER
                         CCW CHAIN AT THE TIC ADDRESS +8.  USE OF
                         SMOD=YES LEADS TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT NOT
                         ALL CCW'S SHOWN IN THE TRACE OUTPUT HAVE
                         ACTUALLY BEEN EXECUTED.

        SORT=YES                   DEFAULT=NO
            =NO
        SORT             IF YOU CODE SORT=YES THE CCW'S ARE SORTED
                         IN ASCENDING ADDRESS SEQUENCE.
                         IF YOU CODE SORT=NO, THE CCW'S ARE PRINTED IN
                         EXECUTION SEQUENCE.

        SUDATA=0000                DEFAULT=0000
        SU=
                         THIS PARAMETER IS USED TO CONTROL THE INTERNAL
                         FLOW OF GTFSIO. IF CODED WRONG, THE RESULT MAY
                         BE UNPREDICTABLE. CODING DEPENDS ON THE SU OR
                         FEATURE LEVEL OF YOUR INSTALLATION.
                         IF SU50, SU65 (MVS-SE), OR ONE OF THE
                         CORRESPONDING FEATURES IS INSTALLED, SU=8000
                         MUST BE CODED. OTHERWISE OMIT THE OPERAND
                         OR CODE SU=0000.
                         IF CODED, CODE ALWAYS 4 HEX DIGITS OR YOU
                         GET A PARM ERROR.

                         SPECIFY SU=8000 FOR SYSTEMS HAVING    @LZ90330
                         MVS/SP1.1 INSTALLED                   @LZ90330
                         SPECIFY SU=8080 FOR SYSTEMS HAVING    @LZ90330
                         MVS/SP1.2 INSTALLED                   @LZ90330
-
       TEST=YES                    DEFAULT=NO
           =NO
       TEST              IF YOU CODE TEST=YES, GTFCCW WILL TERMINATE
                         WITH MESSAGE T09 FOLLOWED BY AN ABEND U122,
                         INSTEAD OF NORMAL TERMINATION OF GTFCCW.
                         SO YOU HAVE THE POSSIBILITY TO GET GTFCCW AND
                         GTFSIO DUMPED TO HELP WITH THE ANALYSIS OF
                         SOME PROBLEMS.

       JOBNAME=NNNNNNNN            DEFAULT=NO
              =NO
       JOB=              IF YOU CODE JOB=JOBNAME ONLY THOSE JOBS HAVING
                         THE SPECIFIED NAME WILL HAVE THEIR CCW'S
                         TRACED. THE JOB PARAMETER HAS NO EFFECT ON
                         STANDARD GTF TRACING. IF JOB=NO, ALL ACTIVITY
                         ON THE SELECTED UNITS WILL HAVE CCW TRACING
                         PERFORMED.

-
      HOW TO EDIT-       ( SEE JCL EXAMPLE BELOW )
      ------------
           THE EDIT FUNCTION IS PERFORMED IN A WAY SIMILAR TO
           THE STANDARD GTF PROCEDURE.  AN ADDITIONAL PARAMETER
           MAY BE SPECIFIED WHILE USING THE CCWTRACE EDIT MODULE.

      NOTE -
      ----      1. TAPES PRODUCED UNDER PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF CCWTRACE
                   CANNOT BE EDITED WITH THIS VERSION.
                2. THE JCL IN THE EXAMPLE CAN BE USED FOR EDITING DUMPS
                   AS WELL. IF ANY GTF CCWTRACE RECORDS ARE PRESENT,
                   THEY WILL BE FORMATTED PROPERLY, IF SELECTED.

     EDIT PARAMETERS FOR CCWTRACE
     ----------------------------

     IN ADDITION TO THE STANDARD AMDPRDMP PARAMETERS, THE FOLLOWING
     PARAMETER MAY ALSO BE SPECIFIED.

      EXIT=NAME            THIS IS THE NAME OF A TRANSLATION EXIT.
                           THE EXIT RECEIVES CONTROL JUST BEFORE THE
                           DATA ON A PRINT-LINE ARE TRANSLATED TO
                           EBCDIC. THIS ALLOWS FOR THE USE OF A
                           DIFFERENT TRANSLATION TABLE OR FOR PRINT
                           LINE FILTERING.
                           FOR DETAILS SEE-
                              ' HOW TO WRITE A TRANSLATION EXIT '

      CPU=NUMBER                    DEFAULT=0

                           THIS PARM IS USED FOR PROCESSING
                           MP OUTPUT. IF NOT SPECIFIED, SELECTED
                           OUTPUT OF CPU 0 WILL BE PRINTED.

                           IF YOU NEED THE TRACE OUTPUT OF ALL CPUS,
                           YOU HAVE TO RUN GTFPRINT FOR EACH CPU YOU
                           NEED.

                           NOTE: GTF, ONCE STARTED ON AN MP, IS ACTIVE
                           FOR ALL CPUS.

      TEST                 IF THIS PARM IS SPECIFIED, GTFCCWPR OR
                           GTFPRINT WILL ABEND WITH U122 IF ANY
                           UNEXPECTED SITUATION OCCURS.
                           IT MAY BE USED TO GET A DUMP IN CASE OF
                           UNEXPECTED INPUT FROM THE TRACE DATASET
                           OR TO DEBUG GTFSIO, GTFCCWPR, OR GTFPRINT.

           UNDERSTANDING THE OUTPUT OF CCWTRACE
           ------------------------------------
0
  THIS ITEM WILL PROVIDE THE FIRST TIME USER OF CCWTRACE WITH
  THE ABILITY TO UNDERSTAND THE OUTPUT DEVELOPED BY CCWTRACE.

  THE FIRST TWO LINES OF A SIO OR I/O INTERRUPT TRACE WILL BE EXACTLY
  AS DOCUMENTED IN MVS DEBUGGING HANDBOOK VOLUME 1, GC28-0708.

  THE CCWTRACE RECORDS ARE CONSTRUCTED AS AN ADD-ON TO THE
  NORMAL GTF RECORDS AND WILL APPEAR AS FOLLOWS:

   CCWADDRESS(1) ACTUAL CCWS(2) DATA(3)

    (1) THE ADDRESS IS THE VIRTUAL LOCATION OF THE 'REAL' CCW.
    (2) THE ACTUAL CCW WILL CONTAIN THE 'REAL' DATA ADDRESS.
    (3) THE DATA DISPLAYED WILL BE THE DATA ADDRESSED BY THE
        CCW. IF THE DATA LENGTH REFERENCED BY THE CCW IS
        GTREATER THAN THE LENGTH REQUESTED BY THE TRACE (DEFAULT
        IS DECIMAL 24 BYTES), THEN THE FIRST AND LAST PORTIONS
        OF THE DATA ARE TRACED. IE: IF THE CCW COUNT IS HEX 18 (24)
        OR LESS, THE ENTIRE DATA WILL BE DISPLAYED. IF THE DATA
        EXCEEEDS HEX 18, THEN THE FIRST AND LAST HEX C BYTES WILL
        BE DISPLAYED IF THE DEFAULT LENGTH IS USED.

     'READ' COMMANDS WILL NOT HAVE DATA TRACED ON AN SIO TRACE.
     ALL DATA TRANSFER COMMANDS WILL HAVE DATA TRACED ON
     I/O INTERRUPT TRACES (IF THE DATA ADDRESS PASSES THE
     VIRTUAL/REAL CONVERSION.

-
     HOW TO WRITE A TRANSLATION EXIT
     -------------------------------
-
          GTF-CCW-TRACE TRANSLATES THE DATA ACCORDING TO THE
          DEVICE-TYPE.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE TRANSLATION IS NOT
          CORRECT FOR SOME DEVICES.  THIS OPTION ALLOWS FOR
          DATA TRANSLATION USING A DIFFERENT TRANSLATE TABLE.
-
          REGISTER-CONTENTS AT ENTRY TO THE EXIT
            REG 1 POINTS TO A PARAMETER-TABLE
            REG 15 IS THE ENTRY POINT ADDRESS OF THE EXIT
            THE PARAMETER-TABLE CONTAINS THE ADDRESS OF THE WRITE
            ROUTINE.
-
          THE FOLLOWING ARE THE VALID PRINT CONTROL CHARACTERS -
            1     =      SKIP TO CHANNEL 1 AND PRINT
            -     =      SPACE 3 AND PRINT
            0     =      SPACE 2 AND PRINT
            ANY OTHER =  SPACE 1 AND PRINT
-
          WHEN CALLING THE WRITE ROUTINE -
            REG 1  POINTS TO THE OUTPUT BUFFER.  LENGTH IS 121 BYTES.
                   THE FIRST BYTE CONTAINS THE PRINT CONTROL CHARACTER.
            REG 15 MUST BE THE ENTRY POINT ADDRESS OF THE WRITE ROUTINE.
-                  ---
          UPON RETURN -
            REG 14  MUST CONTAIN THE RETURN ADDRESS
            REG 15  MUST CONTAIN A RETURN-CODE BETWEEN 0 AND 8

     GTFCCW MESSAGES
     ---------------


   THE FOLLOWING MESSAGES ARE CONTAINED IN AND ISSUED BY MODULE
   GTFCCW, WHICH IS THE INTERFACE TO GTF FOR THE CCWTRACE FUNCTION.

      GENERAL FORMAT
      ------- ------
   CCWTRACE MXX.  ' TEXT '

      WHERE -
      M = T   MEANS THAT CCWTRACE WILL TERMINATE AFTER
              ISSUING THE MESSAGE.
      M = I   MEANS THAT THE MESSAGE IS INFORMATIONAL AND CCWTRACE
              PROCESSING WILL CONTINUE.
      XX      IS A DECIMAL MESSAGE NUMBER.

      DIAGNOSTIC BYTES
      ----------------
   SOME MESSAGE TEXTS WILL ALSO CONTAIN 'DIAGNOSTIC BYTES'. THESE BYTES
   ARE FOR PROBLEM DETERMINATION AND THE BITS WITHIN IT INDICATE
   WHICH PARAMETER CAUSED THE ERROR BEING REPORTED.  BIT ASSIGNMENTS
   ARE AS FOLLOWS -

     8000   IO   PARAMETER
     4000   CCW  PARAMETER
     2000   DATA PARAMETER
     1000   JOB  PARAMETER

     GTFCCW MESSAGES  (CONTINUED)
     ----------------------------


   I00.  CCWTRACE IS STARTING.

   T01.  CCWTRACE IS ALREADY ACTIVE.
         GTFCCW WAS STARTED PREVIOUSLY AND HAS NOT COMPLETED
         TRACING.  THIS IS CHECKED VIA AN EXCLUSIVE ENQ FOR
         QNAME = CCWTRACE  AND  RNAME = INITIALIZATION.

   I02.  PARM OUT OF RANGE.  MAX ASSUMED.  DIAGNOSTIC BYTES = XXXX.
         THIS MESSAGE IS ISSUED WHEN THE VALUE SPECIFIED FOR 'CCW' WAS
         GREATER THAN 255 OR WHEN THE 'DATA' VALUE SPECIFIED WAS GREATER
         THAN 32767.  BITS IN THE DIAGNOSTIC BYTES ARE AS DESCRIBED
         ABOVE.  THE VALUES ASSUMED FOR THE INCORRECT PARAMETER ARE
         AS FOLLOWS -   CCW = 255    AND/OR   DATA = 32767.

   I03.  MULTIPLE PARM SPECIFICATION. LAST USED. DIAGNOSTIC BYTES = XXXX
         A PARAMETER WAS SPECIFIED MORE THAN ONCE IN THE PARM= INPUT.
         THE VALUE GIVEN IN THE LAST SPECIFICATION IS THE ONE IN EFFECT.
         THE BITS IN THE DIAGNOSTIC BYTES ARE DESCRIBED ABOVE.

   T04.  PARAMETER ERROR(S).  DIAGNOSTIC BYTES = XXXX.
         THE PARM= INPUT STRING CONTAINED A CCWTRACE PARAMETER WHOSE
         SPECIFIED VALUE IS INCORRECT.  THIS CAN BE DUE TO MIS-
         SPELLINGS, MISSING COMMAS, INCORRECT VALUES, ETC.  IF PROBLEMS
         IN THIS AREA PERSIST, SPECIFY TEST=YES AS THE FIRST KEYWORD
         AND A DUMP WILL BE TAKEN AFTER ISSUING THE MESSAGE.  BIT
         MEANINGS FOR THE DIAGNOSTIC BYTES ARE AS ABOVE.

   T05.  TRACE PROGRAM COULD NOT BE FIXED.  TYPE = X.
         A RETURN CODE OF 4 OR GREATER WAS RETURNED FROM AN ATTEMPT TO
         FIX A PAGE.  IF TYPE = S, IT WAS A SHORT TERM FIX OF THE
         PARAMETER LIST TO BE USED FOR THE LONG TERM FIX REQUEST WHICH
         FAILED.  IF TYPE = L, IT WAS THE LONG TERM FIX OF THE TRACE
         ROUTINE ITSELF WHICH COULD NOT BE SATISFIED.  IF TYPE = F, THE
         FREE OF THE SHORT TERM FIX FOR THE PARAMETER LIST FAILED.
         IF THE PROBLEM PERSISTS, SPECIFY TEST=YES TO GET A DUMP.  CHECK
         THE RANGE BEING SPECIFIED.  A FAILURE TO SATISFY A LONG TERM
         FIX REQUEST MAY INDICATE THE NEED TO RE-IPL WITH CLPA.

   T06.  TRACE PROGRAM COULD NOT BE FREED.  TYPE = X.
         IF TYPE = F, AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO FIX THE PAGEFREE PARAMETER
         LIST BUT COULD NOT BE SATISFIED.  IF TYPE = L, THE TRACE
         ROUTINE COULD NOT BE FREED FROM LONG-TERM-FIX STATUS.  IF
         TYPE = S, THE RELEASE OF THE PARAMETER LIST WAS UNSUCCESSFUL.
         IF THE PROBLEM PERSISTS, SPECIFY TEST=YES TO GET A DUMP.  CHECK
         THE PARAMETERS FOR THE RELEASE REQUEST.  PROBLEMS IN THIS AREA
         ARE PROBABLY SYSTEM-WIDE AND WILL NOT BE READILY SOLVABLE WITH
         THE DUMP PROVIDED.

     GTFCCW MESSAGES  (CONTINUED)
     ----------------------------
-
   I07.  TRACING STOPPED.
         THIS MESSAGE INDICATES THAT CONTROL HAS BEEN RETURNED FROM THE
         GTF MONITOR AND THAT CCWTRACE CLOSEDOWN IS IN PROGRESS.

   T08.  TRACE RETURN CODE IS XXXX.  DUMP FOLLOWS.
         IF THE GTF MONITOR RETURNS TO GTFCCW WITH A RETURN CODE OF 8 OR
         MORE, A DUMP IS AUTOMATICALLY TAKEN.  THIS MESSAGE IS ISSUED
         TO CLARIFY THE REASON FOR THE DUMP SINCE IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE
         FOR A DUMP TO BE MADE BASED ON THE TEST OPTION -- SEE
         MESSAGE T09.  IF AN ABEND SITUATION OCCURS WHILE TRACING,
         GTF'S FRR WILL -
            1. MAKE A LOGREC ENTRY
            2. WRITE A DUMP TO THE SYS1.DUMPXX DATASET
            3. TERMINATE THE TRACING FUNCTION AND RETURN WITH A CODE
               OF 8 IN REGISTER 15.
         THIS INFORMATION WILL BE NEEDED ALONG WITH THE DUMP BEING TAKEN
         BY GTFCCW.

   T09.  DUMPING BECAUSE TEST = YES.
         IF TEST=YES IS SPECIFIED, A DUMP IS TAKEN UPON TERMINATION OF
         TRACING ACTIVITY WITHOUT REGARD TO THE RETURN CODE.

   T12.  PARAMETER LIST TOO LONG.
         THIS MESSAGE IS ISSUED WHEN THE LENGTH OF THE PARAMETER LIST
         PASSED TO GTFCCW IS LONGER THAN 110 BYTES. A DUMP IS TAKEN TO
         HELP DETERMINE WHERE THE INCORRECT LENGTH OCCURRED.

   T13.  MODID OF AHLTSIO DOES NOT MATCH MODID OF GTFCCW.
         THIS MESSAGE IS ISSUED WHEN CONFLICTING MODULE LEVELS ARE
         DETECTED. IT IS FOLLOWED BY A U0122 DUMP.  THE USUAL REASON
         FOR THIS MESSAGE IS THAT CLPA WAS NOT SPECIFIED DURING IPL
         OR AN INCORRECT LEVEL OF AHLTSIO IS IN AN ACTIVE MLPA LIBRARY.
         IT MAY ALSO BE POSSIBLE, THAT GTFSIO WAS NOT CORECTLY LINKED
         TOGETHER WITH AHLTSIO.

   T14.  INITIALIZATION ERROR FOR MODULE GTFSIO.
         THIS MESSAGE IS GIVEN, IF GTFSIO FAILS TO INITIALIZE ITSELF.
         CHECK YOUR LKED RUN IN THIS CASE.

   T15.  GTFCCW IS NOT AUTORIZED FOR PK ZERO.
         IF THIS MESSAGE IS GIVEN, CHECK YOUR PPT ACCORDING TO STEP 2
         OF THE INSTALLATION PROCEDURE. ONE OF THE MOST COMMON REASONS
         IS, THAT YOU FORGOT CLPA DURING IPL, OR THE CUSTOMER WORKS
         WITH MLPA DURING IPL AND WORKS WITH ITS OWN INITIATOR.

    GTFSIO MESSAGES (TRACE ROUTINE)
    -------------------------------
-
    NOTE - THESE MESSAGES ARE WRITTEN TO THE GTF OUTPUT FILE BY THE
           TRACE ROUTINE.  THEY ARE PRINTED BY THE EDIT ROUTINE ONLY
           WHEN PRINTING CCW TRACE OUTPUT.
-
    GTFSIO02  NO VALID CCW'S LOCATED DURING CCW SCAN.
       THIS MESSAGE IS WRITTEN WHEN ALL POSSIBLE CCW ADDRESSES ARE
       FOUND NOT TO CONTAIN VALID CCW'S.

       IF THIS MESSAGE IS GIVEN VERY FREQUENTLY, MAKE SURE     @LZ90330
       YOUR SUDATA PARAMETER IS CORRECTLY SPECIFIED.           @LZ90330

    GTFPRINT MESSAGES (EDIT ROUTINE)
    --------------------------------
-
    GTF001  PARAMETER ERROR, PGM TERMINATED.
       THIS MESSAGE IS GIVEN VIA A WTL WTOR. TOGETHER WITH THIS
       MESSAGE, THE PGM IS TERMINATED AND THE RETURNCODE
       IS SET TO 16. CHECK YOUR PARM DEFINITION FOR THE FOLLOWING
       REASON AND RERUN THE JOB.

       1. THE PARM FIELD PASSED IS TOO LONG.
       2. THE PARM FIELD PASSED IS NOT THE ONLY ONE.
       3. ONE OF THE GTFPRINT PARMS IS INVALID OR CONTAINS
          AN ERROR.
       4. ONE OF THE GTFPRINT PARMS IS DOUBLE SPECIFIED.

     GTF002  MODID OF GTFPRINT DOES NOT MATCH THE MODID OF GTFCCWPR.
        WHEN RUNNING GTFPRINT, IT IS REQUIRED, THAT ALL LOADS NEEDED
        HAVE THE SAME LEVEL. IF GTFCCWPR HAS AN OTHER LEVEL, THIS
        MESSAGE IS PRINTED AND THE PGM TERMINATE WITH A USER ABEND122.

     GTF003  MODID OF GTFPRINT DOES NOT MATCH THE MODID OF AMDSYS00.
        WHEN RUNNING GTFPRINT, IT IS REQUIRED, THAT ALL LOADS NEEDED
        HAVE THE SAME LEVEL. IF AMDSYS00 HAS AN OTHER LEVEL, THIS
        MESSAGE IS PRINTED AND THE PGM TERMINATE WITH A USER ABEND122.
          IN CASE OF THIS MESSAGE, PLEASE CHECK THE INSTALLATION
        PROCEDURE FOR CORRECT RENAME OF AMDSYS00 TO AMDSYS0S IN THE
        LPALIB. YOU SCHOULD ALSO NOTE, THAT STEPLIB PROCESSING IS
        NOT POSSIBLE FOR THOSE LOADS, THAT MUST RESIDE IN THE LPALIB.

       POSSIBLE CAUSES, AMONG THEM, THAT GTF COULD NOT WRITE ITS
       BUFFERS FAST ENOUGH OR THAT AN I/O ERROR OCCURRED ON THE
       GTF OUTPUT DEVICE.

    GTFPR02  CHAIN NOT COMPLETE.
       THERE WERE MORE CCW'S THAN SPECIFIED ON THE CCW = PARAMETER
       OR ELSE THERE WERE MORE THAN 512 CCW'S IN THE CHAIN.

    GTFPR03  END OF NORMAL CHAIN.
       END OF CHAIN IS DETECTED, BUT EDIT OF CCW'S CONTINUES.
         A) IN CASE OF SIO TYPE THE CURRENT CCW DOES NEITHER HAVE
            COMMAND CHAINING, NOR DATA CHAINING.
         B) IN CASE OF IO TYPE THE CURRRENT CCW IS POINTED BY THE CSW-8.

    GTFPR04  CHAIN LOST.
       THE ADDRESS OF THE NEXT CCW IS INVALID:
         A) NOT IN REAL STORAGE
         B) NOT A MULTIPLE OF 8
         C) TIC-TO ADDRESS IS INVALID
       IN THE CASE OF AN I/O INTERRUPT, THE ADDRESS AT CSW - 8 WILL
       BE ATTEMPTED IN ORDER TO AT LEAST BRING THE LAST CCW EXECUTED.

    GTFPR05  CHAIN STARTS AT 00XXXXXX
       WHEN SORT = YES, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE 1ST CCW LISTED IS NOT
       THE LOGICAL START OF THE CHAIN.  THE ADDRESS GIVEN IN THIS
       MESSAGE IS THE LOGICAL START OF THE CHAIN.  THIS MESSAGE ONLY
       OCCURS WHEN SORT WAS SPECIFIED FOR THE TRACE.

    GTFPR06  ERROR IN INPUT RECORD.
       EITHER 1) THE LAST RECORD WAS NOT FOUND IN A CHAIN
                 (E.G., GTF BUFFERS ALL FULL, DATA LOST),
           OR 2) THE RECORD COUNT IS NOT THE EXPECTED VALUE.

    GTFPR07  DATA COULD NOT BE TRACED.
       EITHER 1) INVALID DATA ADDRESS,
           OR 2) DATA BUFFER NOT IN REAL STORAGE.

    GTFPR08  DATA TRACING NOT REQUESTED.
       DATA=NO WAS SPECIFIED WHEN THE GTFCCW PROCEDURE WAS STARTED.

    GTFPR09  EXPECTED CONTINUATION OF PREVIOUS RECORD NOT RECEIVED.
       GTFCCWPR IS PROCESSING A RECORD, WANTS TO READ ITS CONTINUATION,
       BUT THE RECORD TYPE RECEIVED IS NOT THAT AS EXPECTED.
       THE NEXT LINE FOLLOWING THIS MESSAGE MAY EXPLAIN THE REASON.
       THE MESSAGE MAY ALSO BE FOLLOWED BY A DUMP RECORD, TITLED 'DUMP'.
       IN THIS CASE, A RECOVERABLE PROGRAM CHECK OCCURRED IN GTFSIO.

 MAINTENANCE HINTS.
 -----------------

 1. FOR GTFCCW
 -------------

 IN CASE OF A PGM CHECK, SEND A SYSUDUMP WHICH CONTAINS THE LPA MODULE
 AHLTSIO. USE THE CHNGDUMP COMMAND TO ALTER THE SYSUDUMP PARMS IF YOUR
 DUMP DOES NOT CONTAIN LPA MODULES.  EXAMPLE:
    CD SET,SYSUDUMP,SDATA=(SQA,LSQA,CB,TRT),PDATA=(ALLPDATA)

 IN MOST CASES SYS1.LOGREC WILL HAVE PERTINENT INFORMATION IN IT.  BE
 SURE TO PRINT IT AND SEND IT ALONG WITH THE DUMP.

 USE GTFPRINT TO PRINT THE TRACE DATASET AT TIME OF ERROR.  SEND IT
 ALONG WITH THE DUMP. A BLOCK TITLED 'DUMP' WILL HAVE THE MOST PERTINENT
 INFORMATION IN IT.

 WARNING: AFTER ANY ABNORMAL TERMINATION OF GTFCCW OR NORMAL GTF WITH
          OR WITHOUT THIS MODIFICATION, DO NOT START AGAIN PRIOR IPL.
          OTHERWISE YOU MAY GET ABEND S0F6.

          NOTE ALSO, THAT IT IS A RESTRICTION OF GTF, THAT IT HAS TO
          BE STARTED FROM THE CONSOLE. TIME=1440 MUST ALSO BE CODED IN
          THE EXEC STATEMENT OF THE PROCEDURE.


 2.) FOR GTFPRINT
 ----------------

 IN CASE OF A PROGRAM CHECK, SEND A SYSUDUMP AND A MACHINE READABLE
 COPY OF THE FAILING TRACE DATASET.
 IN CASE OF INCORRECT OUTPUT, IT MAY BE USEFUL TO RUN GTFPRINT WITH
 PARAMETER 'TEST'. IN CASE OF AN UNEXPECTED PARAMETER OR RECORD,
 EITHER GTFPRINT OR GTFCCWPR WILL ABEND WITH A USER CODE OF U122.
 SEND THE DUMP AND/OR THE FAILING OUTPUT ALONG WITH YOUR ERROR
 DESCRIPTION.


 3.) GENERAL
 -----------

 FIXES FOR KNOWN PROBLEMS WILL BE IN RETAIN IN THE SEARCH FILE.
 THE FOLLOWING SEARCH ARGUMENT SHOULD GET YOU TO THE INFORMATION:
   N;4/F ALL/P;CCWTRACE R030
 HAVE A LOOK AT THE GTF COMPONENT IN SSF, TOO.

 IT MAY ALSO BE USEFUL TO LOOK IN THE INCIDENT FILE FOR PROBLEMS.  IF
 YOU WANT TO DEBUG A PROBLEM YOURSELF, YOU CAN GET AN ASSEMBLER LISTING
 OF YOUR FAILING MODULE. SOURCE IS WITHIN THIS VOLUME;  REFER TO:
 'FORMAT AND CONTENTS OF THE DISTRIBUTION TAPE'.

 IN ALL CASES, AN INCIDENT IN RETAIN IS HELPFUL TO CLEAR THE
 SITUATION. OPEN THE INCIDENT WITH THE ADDITIONAL KEYWORD 'CCWTRACE' TO:

      QUEUE GT3 COMPONENT 5752SC111
