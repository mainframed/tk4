*                                                                     *
* PURPOSE: WHEN DEALING WITH PARTITIONED DATA SETS (PDS'ES), PROBLEMS *
*          CAN ARISE WHEN THERE ARE BAD MEMBERS.  FOR EXAMPLE, IEBCOPY*
*          WILL STOP IF IT FINDS A MEMBER WITH AN I/O ERROR.  THE USER*
*          WOULD HAVE TO EXCLUDE THIS MEMBER AND CONTINUE UNTIL THE   *
*          NEXT BAD MEMBER WAS FOUND.  CHECKPDS WAS WRITTEN TO FIND   *
*          THESE ERRORS IN PDS'ES.                                    *
*                                                                     *
*          IF THE PDS IS NOT A LOAD MODULE (A PDS IS ASSUMED TO BE A  *
*          LOAD MODULE IF ITS RECFM=U), CHECKPDS READS EACH MEMBER    *
*          SEARCHING FOR MEMBERS WITH I/O ERRORS.  IF A AN I/O ERROR  *
*          OCCURS WHILE READING A MEMBER, CHECKPDS PRINTS THE MEMBER  *
*          NAME AND THE SYNAD INFORMATION AND THEN PROCEEDS TO THE    *
*          NEXT MEMBER.  THIS WAY THE USER FINDS ALL OF THE MEMBERS IN*
*          ERROR AT ONE TIME.                                         *
*                                                                     *
*          SOME PROGRAMS DO NOT LIKE NULL MEMBERS, I.E. MEMBERS WITH  *
*          NOTHING IN THEM (SMP FOR EXAMPLE).  CHECKPDS WILL ALSO     *
*          PRINT THE NAME OF THE MEMBERS THAT ARE NULL.               *
*                                                                     *
*          IF THE USER INCLUDES A DDCARD WITH THE NAME 'PUNCH',       *
*          CHECKPDS WILL BUILD THE IEBCOPY STATEMENTS:                *
*            COPY INDD=INPUT,OUTDD=OUTPUT                             *
*            EXCLUDE MEMBER=XXXXXXXX                                  *
*          FOR EACH MEMBER THAT AN I/O ERROR WAS RECEIVED.  THE OUTPUT*
*          FROM THE 'PUNCH' DD CAN BE PASSED TO IEBCOPY IN THE NEXT   *
*          STEP TO COPY THE PDS WITHOUT THE BAD MEMBERS.  NOTE, THAT  *
*          EXCLUDE CARDS ARE NOT BUILT FOR NULL MEMBERS, AND ARE NOT  *
*          INCLUDED IN CHECKPDS'ES ERROR COUNT.                       *
*                                                                     *
*          IF THE PDS IS A LOAD MODULE (RECFM=U), THE ABOVE PROCESSING*
*          IS NOT DONE (UNLESS THE USER SPECIFIES 'PARM=NOLOAD'  I.E  *
*          //   EXEC   PGM=CHECKPDS,PARM=NOLOAD).  FOR LOAD MODULES   *
*          CHECKPDS LOOKS FOR THE FOLLOWING:                          *
*             NON-EXCUTABLE LOAD MODULES                              *
*             ALIASES WHERE THE TTR OF THE ALIAS DOES NOT POINT TO    *
*               THE SAME TTR OF THE MEMBER IT IS SUPPOSE TO BE AN     *
*               ALIAS OF (XXXXXXXX IS NOT A TRUE ALIAS)               *
*             ALIASES WHERE THE MODULE THAT IT IS SUPPOSE TO BE AN    *
*               ALIAS OF IS NOT IN THE PDS                            *
*             MEMBERS THAT WOULD CAUSE AN ERROR IF A LOAD WAS DONE OF *
*               THEM.  FOR THESE, CHECKPDS PRINTS SXXX-CC WHERE XXX-CC*
*               CAN BE FOUND IN 'MVS SYSTEM CODES'.                   *
*                                                                     *
*          CHECKPDS WILL ALSO INDICATE MEMBERS THAT WERE NOT LINK-EDIT*
*          WITH THE VS LINKAGE-EDITOR, AND ALIASES WHERE THE MODULE IS*
*          AN ALIAS OF ITSELF(THE DIRECTORY ENTRY CONTAINS THE TRUE   *
*          MEMBER NAME).  THESE TWO TYPES OF ERRORS ARE NOT INCLUDE IN*
*          CHECKPDS'ES ERROR COUNT.                                   *
*          NO CARDS ARE PUNCHED, EVEN IF THE 'PUNCH' DD IS INCLUDED.  *
*          IF CHECKPDS IS PASSED THE PARM OF 'NOLOAD', THE PDS IS     *
*          TREATED AS IF IT WERE NOT A LOAD MODULE, I.E. ALL MEMBERS  *
*          ARE JUST READ FOR I/O ERRORS.                              *
*                                                                     *
*          WHEN FINISHED, CHECKPDS WILL INDICATE THE NUMBER OF MEMBERS*
*          PROCESSED, AND THE NUMBER IN ERROR.                        *
*                                                                     *
