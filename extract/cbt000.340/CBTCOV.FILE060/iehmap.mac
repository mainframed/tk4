                             INTRODUCTION


    IEHMAP  IS  A  PROGRAM  THAT GIVES A FORMATTED LISTING OF A VTOC, A
 DATASET OR A CATALOG IN A FORMAT THAT IS MORE EASILY HANDLED THAN THAT
 PRODUCED  BY  THE  IEHLIST  SYSTEM  UTILITY.  IEHMAP  ALSO HAS SPECIAL
 FEATURES  THAT  HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED AS THEY WERE REQUESTED. SOME OF
 THESE FEATURES ARE THE ABILITY TO RESTORE MISSING TRACKS TO A VTOC, TO
 COMPLETELY  RE-WRITE  THE  VTOC'S  FORMAT  5  CHAIN, AND TO GIVE SPACE
 UTILIZATION REPORTS BY INDEX LEVEL.

    IEHMAP  RUNS  AS A PROBLEM PROGRAM UNDER VS AND REQUIRES NO SPECIAL
 CHANGES  TO  BE  MADE TO VS. IT CONSISTS OF TWO REENTRANT LOAD MODULES
 WHICH   MUST  HAVE  AN  AUTHORIZATION  CODE  (LINKAGE  EDITOR  SETCODE
 OPERATION) OF ONE (1).









    IEHMAP  MAY  BE  INVOKED  IN  THE  STANDARD WAY, PASSING PARAMETERS
 AND/OR ALTERNATE DDNAME'S. SEE THE UTILITIES SRL.

                        JCL TO EXECUTE IEHMAP


 JCL REQUIRED TO EXECUTE IEHMAP IS STANDARD SYSTEM UTILITY JCL:

   //STEPNAME EXEC PGM=IEHMAP<,REGION=XXXXXK>
   // <,PARM='LINES=/L=NNN,MIN=MMM,MAX=VVV,TSO'>
   //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=C<,DCB=BLKSIZE=BBBBB>

   //SYSIN DD *<,DCB=BLKSIZE=SSSSS>

      WHERE:

           NNN  (LINE  COUNT) IS ANY NUMBER FROM 10 THRU 999. THIS WILL
                BE  USED  TO  SET  THE LINE COUNT PER PAGE. THE DEFAULT
                LINE COUNT IS 56.

                NOTE:

                      IF  AN  INVALID  LINE  COUNT  IS PASSED TO IEHMAP
                           (LESS  THAN  10  OR  GREATER  THAN 999), THE
                           DEFAULT  LINE  COUNT  (56)  WILL BE USED. AN
                           ERROR MESSAGE WILL BE ISSUED; IT WILL APPEAR
                           IN THE USER'S JCL.

                      FOR  INSTALATIONS WITH UNUSUAL PAPER SIZES, ETC.,
                           THIS   MAY   BE  PERMANENTLY  OVERRIDDEN  BY
                           SUPERZAPPING   THE  CONSTANT  'LINESIZE'  IN
                           CSECT IEHMAPIN IN LOAD MODULE IEHMAPIN.

           TSO  THIS NOTIFIES IEHMAP THAT IT IS RUNNING UNDER TSO, AND,
                THEREFORE,  IT  IS  NOT  AUTHORIZED. WHEN RUNNING UNDER
                TSO,  IT CANNOT ENQ UPON THE VTOC OR CATALOG; ALSO, THE
                FIXUP AND SORT CONTROL CARDS CANNOT BE SPECIFIED.

           MMM  (MIN=  PARAMETER) IS THE MINIMUM VALUE (IN K-BYTES) FOR
                THE  VARIABLE  CONDITIONAL  GETMAIN'S  IEHMAP  DOES  TO
                OBTAIN  THE AREA FOR CONTROL BLOCKS, READING IN DSCB'S,
                ETC.  THIS  WILL  BE  ROUNDED  TO  THE  NEXT HIGHER 4-K
                BOUNDARY. THE DEFAULT IS 64 (16 4-K PAGES).

                NOTE:

                      THIS    CAN    BE   OVERRIDDEN   PERMANENTLY   BY
                           SUPERZAPPING   THE  CONSTANT  'MINVALUE'  IN
                           CSECT IEHMAPIN IN LOAD MODULE IEHMAPIN.

           VVV  (MAX=  PARAMETER) IS THE MAXIMUM VALUE (IN K-BYTES) FOR
                THE  VARIABLE  CONDITIONAL  GETMAIN'S  IEHMAP  DOES  TO
                OBTAIN  THE AREA FOR CONTROL BLOCKS, READING IN DSCB'S,
                ETC.  THIS  WILL  BE  ROUNDED  TO  THE  NEXT HIGHER J-K
                BOUNDARY.  THE  VALUE  MUST  BE AT LEAST 1 (ONE) HIGHER
                THAN  THE VALUE OF THE MIN= PARAMETER (OR ITS DEFAULT);
                IF  IT  IS  NOT,  IT  WILL BE SET TO MMM+4. THE DEFAULT
                VALUE IS 128 (32 4-K PAGES).

                NOTE:

                      THIS    CAN    BE   PERMANENTLY   OVERRIDDEN   BY
                           SUPERZAPPING   THE  CONSTANT  'MAXVALUE'  IN

           C  (SYSOUT  CLASS) IS ANY ALPHA CHARACTER FROM A TO Z OR ANY
                NUMERIC CHARACTER FROM 0 THRU 9.

                NOTE:

                      FOR PROPER OUTPUT, IEHMAP REQUIRES A 132 POSITION
                           PRINTER WITH A QN OR EQUIVALENT TRAIN/CHAIN;
                           THIS  IS REQUIRED AS IEHMAP USES THE SPECIAL
                           SYMBOLS <, >, ?, AND _.

           BBBBB  (BLKSIZE  FOR  SYSPRINT) IS ANY MULTIPLE OF 137 UP TO
                AND  INCLUDING  FULL-TRACK  BLOCKING; LRECL IS 137. THE
                DEFAULT BLOCKSIZE IS 3509. THE RECORD FORMAT IS VBA.

           SSSSS  (BLKSIZE  FOR  SYSIN) IS ANY MULTIPLE OF 80 UP TO AND
                INCLUDING FULL-TRACK BLOCKING; LRECL IS 80. THE DEFAULT
                BLOCKING FACTOR IS 1; IE, BLKSIZE=80.

   XXXXX  (REGION  SIZE)  AT  THE END OF THE OUTPUT FOR A CONTROL CARD,
        IEHMAP  PRINTS  FOUR  UNNUMBERED  MESSAGES GIVING STATISTICS ON
        CORE UTILIZATION, BROKEN DOWN BY SUBPOOL NUMBER.

           1.  THE  SECOND  LINE  GIVES  CORE ALLOCATED IN K-BYTES, THE
                THIRD LINE GIVES CORE USED IN DECIMAL BYTES.

                A.  REGION  SIZE  -  THIS  IS  THE  SIZE  OF THE REGION
                     (ADDRESS  SPACE)  IEHMAP  IS RUNNING IN (UNDER VS2
                     RELEASE  2  OR ABOVE, THIS WILL BE THE SIZE OF THE
                     PRIVATE AREA).

                B.  PROGRAM  SIZE  -  THIS IS THE TOTAL OF SUBPOOLS 252
                     (REENTRANT)  AND  251 (NON-REENTRANT); IT DOES NOT
                     INCLUDE ANY MODULES IN THE VS LINK PACK AREA.

                C.  SUPBOOL  0 - THIS IS THE SIZE OF ALL AREAS OBTAINED
                     BY  IEHMAP  AND  THE  SYSTEM FOR I/O BUFFERS, ETC.
                     THIS SHOULD BE APPROXIMATELY TWO TIMES THE SIZE OF
                     (SSSSS + BBBBB) ROUNDED TO A 4-K BOUNDARY.

                D. SUBPOOL 1 - THIS IS THE SIZE OF THE AREA OBTAINED BY
                     IEHMAP  FOR  SAVEAREAS  FOR  INTRA CSECT AND INTER
                     CSECT LINKAGES.

                E.  SUBPOOL  2  - THIS IS THE SIZE OF THE AREA OBTAINED
                     VIA  VARIABLE  CONDITIONAL  GETMAIN'S  FOR CONTROL
                     BLOCKS, READ IN AREAS FOR DSCB'S, ETC. THE MINIMUM
                     AND  MAXIMUM VALUES ARE CONTROLLED BY THE MIN= AND
                     MAX=  PARAMETERS.  ONCE OBTAINED, THIS AREA IS NOT
                     FREED UNTIL ALL CONTROL CARDS HAVE BEEN PROCESSED;
                     IE,  THE  SIZE  MAY  GO UP WITH SUBSEQUENT CONTROL
                     CARDS,  BUT  IT WILL NEVER GO DOWN. THEREFORE, THE
                     AMOUNT   USED   IN   SUBPOOL   2  MAY  BE  GREATLY
                     DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE SIZE OF SUBPOOL 2.

                F.  SUBPOOL  3  - THIS IS THE SIZE OF IEHMAP'S WORKAREA
                     (CONTAINING  SCRATCH  AREAS, CHAIN HEADERS, DCB'S,
                     ETC.)

                G. MIN= AND MAX= - THESE ARE THE VALUES OF THE MIN= AND
                     MAX=  VARIABLES  FOR  OBTAINING SUBPOOL 2 CORE. IF
                     NOT OVERRIDDEN VIA THE PARM FIELD, THE WILL BE SET
                     AT MIN=64K AND MAX=128K.

                H.  REGION USED - THIS IS THE TOTAL OF ALL USED CORE IN
                     THE ABOVE SUBPOOLS.

 SECTION I-C: CORE REQUIREMENTS

           2.  THE  FOURTH  LINE  GIVES THE APPROXIMATE, MINIMUM REGION
                REQUIRED  FOR  THE CURRENT CONTROL CARD RUNNING AGAINST
                THE CURRENT VOLUME. THIS IS A TOTAL OF THE FOLLOWING:

                A. SUBPOOL 0 ALLOCATED
                B. SUBPOOL 1 ALLOCATED
                C. SUBPOOL 2 USED ROUNDED TO THE MIN= VALUE
                D. SUBPOOL 3 ALLOCATED
                E. PROGRAM SIZE

           3.  SINCE  IEHMAP  DOES VARIABLE CONDITIONAL GETMAIN'S, WHEN
                RUNNING  UNDER  VS2  RELEASE  2 OR ABOVE, A REGION SIZE
                MUST  BE  SUPPLIED  ON  THE JOB OR EXEC JCL CARD OR THE
                SIZE  PARAMETER  WHEN  LOGGING ONTO TSO, IF THE DEFAULT
                REGION  SIZE  IS  NOT EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN THE SIZE
                GIVEN IN THE MINIMUM REGION REQUIRED MESSAGE.

           4.  FOR  VOLUMES  WITH  A  LARGE NUMBER OF DATASETS, FOR TTR
                CONTROL  CARD  OUTPUT,  FOR VERIFY CONTROL CARD OUTPUT,
                AND  FOR SPACE, USERID OR DEPT CONTROL CARD OUTPUT, THE
                REGION  SIZE  MAY  HAVE  TO BE INCREASED TO AS LARGE AS
                1000K OR MORE.

                         DDCARD'S FOR IEHMAP


 SYSPRINT  THIS  IS  THE  PRIMARY  OUTPUT  FOR  IEHMAP; IT CONTAINS A A
      LISTING  OF  THE  CONTROL CARDS, ANY ERROR MESSAGES THAT MAY HAVE
      BEEN GENERATED, AND THE OUTPUT REQUESTED BY THE CONTROL CARDS.

 SYSPRINT  HAS  A  RECORD  FORMAT  OF VARIABLE BLOCKED WITH ASA CONTROL
      CHARACTERS  (VBA),  A LOGICAL RECORD LENGTH OF 137, AND A DEFAULT
      BLOCKSIZE  OF  3509.  THE  BLOCKSIZE  MAY  BE  OVERRIDDEN VIA THE
      DDCARD.

      NOTE:

            THIS  IS A CHANGE FORM IEHMAP VERSIONS I AND II. VERSIONS I
                 AND  II  HAD A RECORD FORMAT OF FIXED BLOCKED WITH ASA
                 CONTROL  CHARACTERS  (FBA) AND A LOGICAL RECORD LENGTH
                 OF  133.  THIS  WAS CHANGED IN VERSION III TO CONSERVE
                 SPACE IN THE SYSPRINT FILE.

 SYSIN  THIS  IS  THE  CONTROL  CARD  INPUT  TO IEHMAP. IT CONTAINS THE
      CONTROL  CARDS  THE USER HAS PRODUCED TO TELL IEHMAP WHAT TYPE OF
      OUTPUT HE WANTS.

 SYSIN HAS A RECORD FORMAT OF FIXED BLOCKED, A LOGICAL RECORD LENGTH OF
      80,  AND  A  DEFAULT  BLOCKSIZE  OF  80.  THE  BLOCKSIZE  MAY  BE
      OVERRIDDEN VIA THE DDCARD.

 DDNAME1  THRU DDNAMEN THESE DDCARD'S (WHICH CAN HAVE ANY DDNAME EXCEPT
      THE   FOLLOWING  -  SYSIN,  SYSPRINT,  JOBLIB,  STEPLIB,  JOBCAT,
      STEPCAT,  SYSABEND,  SYSUDUMP,  AND PGM=*.DD) SUPPLY A VOLUME FOR
      IEHMAP  TO WORK WITH. IF A VTOC LISTING IS REQUESTED, IEHMAP WILL
      INTERNALLY  CHANGE  THE  JFCB TO POINT TO THE VOLUME'S VTOC, IF A
      CATALOG LISTING, TO THE CATALOG, IF A DATASET, TO THE DATASET.

                            CONTROL CARDS


 CONTROL CARDS FOR IEHMAP ARE FREE FORM WITH THE FOLLOWING FORMAT:

           <NAME> OPERATION OPERAND1<,OPERAND2><,OPT=(OPTIONS)>

         NAME  IS  OPTIONAL,  BUT  IF  OMITTED,  AT  LEAST ONE BLANK IS
              REQUIRED.  THE  LENGTH OF THE NAME FIELD NEED NOT BE LESS
              THAN OR EQUAL EIGHT CHARACTERS AS IT IS IGNORED.

         OPERAND1 AND/OR OPERAND2 CAN BE ONE OF THE FOLLOWING:

                DSNAME
                VOL=VOLID
                CNAME=ALT-CATALOG-NAME
                QUAL=QUALIFIER-NAME

           DSNAME  THIS  IS  THE  FULLY QUALIFIED NAME OF A DATASET FOR
                IEHMAP  TO  WORK  WITH OR, IF THE OPERATION IS CATLG OR
                USERID,  IT MAY BE AN INDEX LEVEL. IF IT IS A MEMBER OF
                A  GDG,  IT  CAN  BE SUPPLIED IN THE MANNER OF JCL; IE,
                GDG(-1), GDG(0), ETC.

           VOL=  THIS  IS THE VOLUME (VOLID) FOR IEHMAP TO WORK WITH OR
                THE VOLUME ON WHICH DSNAME OR THE CATALOG RESIDES.

           CNAME= THIS IS THE DSNAME TO BE USED ON A CATLG LISTING WHEN
                THE  CATALOG'S  NAME IS NOT SYSCTLG. THIS WOULD BE USED
                WHEN A BACKUP COPY OF THE CATALOG IS BEING KEPT AND YOU
                WISH TO LIST IT.

           QUAL=  THIS  GIVES  THE NUMBER OF DIGITS THAT SHOULD BE USED
                FOR  A  DEPT  OPERATION.  THE QUALIFIER-NAME MAY BE ANY
                CHARACTERS  WHICH  ADD  UP  TO  THE LENGTH DESIRED; EG,
                QUAL=DDD WOULD GIVE A 3 DIGIT LENGTH.

           OPT=  FOR CERTAIN OF THE IEHMAP OPERATIONS, OTHER OPERATIONS
                MAY  BE  COMPATIBLE AND CAN BE SPECIFIED AS THE OPTIONS
                OF  THE OPT= FIELD. FOR CERTAIN OPERATIONS (SEE BELOW),
                OPT= MUST BE SPECIFIED.

                NOTES:

                      IF  VOLID  IS  NOT GIVEN AND DSNAME IS, DSNAME IS
                           ASSUMED  TO BE CATALOGED AND A SEARCH OF THE
                           CATALOG  WILL  BE  MADE,  USING THE "SYSRES"
                           CATALOG AS THE START OF THE CATALOG SEARCH.

                      IF  VOLID  IS GIVEN WITH DSNAME, THAT VOLUME WILL
                           BE  USED  AS  THE  LOCATION  OF  DSNAME,  NO
                           CATALOG SEARCH WILL BE MADE.

                      IF  DSNAME  IS  GIVEN  IN  THE  JCL FORM OF A GDG
                           MEMBER,  IT MUST BE CATALOGED; THEREFORE, IF
                           VOLID IS GIVEN, IT WILL BE IGNORED.

                      IF  CNAME= IS GIVEN, VOL= MUST ALSO BE SPECIFIED,
                           UNLESS   THE  ALTERNATE  CATALOG  IS  ITSELF
                           CATALOGED IN THE SYSTEM CATALOG.

                      IF  MULTIPLE  OPTIONS ARE SPECIFIED, THEY MUST BE
                           ENCLOSED  IN  PARENTHESES  AND  SEPARATED BY
                           COMMAS; IF ONLY ONE OPTION IS SPECIFIED, THE
                           PARENTHESES MAY BE OMITTED.

                      IF  THE  OPERATION  IS  DEPT  OR  SPACE, THE VOL=
                           PARAMETER MAY HAVE MULTIPLE VOLID'S ENCLOSED
                           IN PARENTHESES; EG, VOL=(D06DB0,D89RES).

                      THE  QUAL=  OPERAND  MAY BE SPECIFIED ONLY IF THE
                           OPERATION IS DEPT; IN ALL OTHER CASES, IT IS
                           IGNORED.

      CHAINS BUT THE FORMAT 1 CHAIN.

 CCHHR CONTROL CARD

   1. <NAME> CCHHR VOL=VOLID

      THIS  WILL  GIVE THE SAME INFORMATION AS A DUMP VOL=VOLID CONTROL
      CARD  WOULD  GIVE;  HOWEVER,  THE  DSCB'S WILL BE DUMPED IN CCHHR
      ORDER;  THAT IS, THEY WILL BE DUMPED IN THE ORDER THEY ARE IN THE
      VTOC,  NOT  ALPHABETICALLY  BY  DATASET  NAME.  ALSO, THE VARIOUS
      CHAINS OF DSCB'S (THE FORMAT 1 CHAIN, THE FORMAT 5 CHAIN, AND THE
      FORMAT  6  CHAIN)  WILL  NOT  BE  DUMPED  IN CHAIN ORDER. THIS IS
      SIMILAR TO THE DUMP OPTION OF IEHLIST.

   2. <NAME> CCHHR DSNAME

      THIS  WILL GIVE THE SAME INFORMATION AS A CCHHR VOL=VOLID CONTROL
      CARD  WOULD  FOR  THE VOLUME ON WHICH DSNAME RESIDES; IE, IT WILL
      NOT  DUMP  ONLY THE DSCB'S ASSOCIATED WITH DSNAME - THIS WOULD BE
      ACCOMPLISHED BY USING THE DUMP DSNAME CONTROL CARD.

 DSNAME CONTROL CARD

   1. <NAME> DSNAME DSNAME

      THIS  WILL  GIVE  THE SAME INFORMATION AS A NAME CONTROL CARD FOR

      NOTE:

           THE  CATALOG  PROCESSING ROUTINES OF IEHMAP CANNOT PROCESS A
           VSAM CATALOG.

   1. <NAME> CATLG VOL=VOLID

      THIS WILL GIVE:

           A. A SUMMARY OF THE CATALOG FOR VOLID GIVING:

                THE NUMBER OF BLOCKS IN THE CATALOG
                THE FIRST AVAILABLE TTR IN THE CATALOG
                THE FIRST EXTENT OF THE CATALOG
                THE NUMBER OF EXTENTS THE CATALOG OCCUPIES
                THE NUMBER OF CATALOG BLOCKS PER TRACK

           B. AN ALPHABETICAL LISTING OF ALL CATALOG ENTRIES GIVING:

                THE CATALOG ENTRY
                THE TYPE OF ENTRY
                THE NUMBER OF VOLUMES A DATASET IS CATALOGED TO

                VOLUME TYPE IN HEX
                VOLUME DESCRIPTION
                VOLUME SEQUENCE NUMBER

                NOTE:

                      A  VOLUME DESCRIPTION OF 'UNKNOWN' SAYS THAT THAT
                      PARTICULAR  TYPE  OF  DEVICE  IS  NOT IN IEHMAP'S
                      TABLE  OF  VOLUME  TYPES.  THIS USUALLY OCCURS ON
                      DATASETS  THAT  ARE  CATALOGED VIA IEHPROGM USING
                      VOL=SYSDA=VOLID.   THIS   CAN   BE  CORRECTED  BY
                      SUPERZAPPING  THE  CATDEV  CSECT  IN  LOAD MODULE
                      IEHMAP.

                THE NUMBER OF GDG INDICES FOUND
                THE NUMBER OF CVOL ENTRIES FOUND
                THE NUMBER OF UNUSED INDICES FOUND
                THE NUMBER OF DATASETS CATALOGED
                THE NUMBER OF ALIAS ENTRIES FOUND
                THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF INDICES IN A NAME

           E. A USEAGE SUMMARY OF THE CATALOG BLOCKS

                THE NUMBER OF BLOCKS IN THE CATALOG
                THE NUMBER OF UNUSED BLOCKS IN THE CATALOG

           F. A SUMMARY OF I/O OPERATIONS

                THE NUMBER OF ENTRIES TO THE READ ROUTINE
                THE NUMBER OF CATALOG BLOCKS FOUND IN CORE

                THESE  TWO  STATISTICS  GIVE  SOME  INDICATION  OF  THE
                FRAGMENTATION  OF  THE  CATALOG  INDICES. THE NUMBER OF
                ENTRIES  TO  THE  READ ROUTINE IS THE NUMBER OF TIMES A
                CHAIN  OF  BLOCKS  WAS BEING FOLLOWED (EITHER FOWARD OR
                BACKWARDS).  THE NUMBER OF CATALOG BLOCKS FOUND IN CORE
                IS  THE NUMBER OF TIMES A PREVIOUSLY READ CATALOG BLOCK
                WAS   REQUESTED  (FOR  EFFICIENCY  AND  TO  LESSEN  I/O
                OPERATIONS,  AS IEHMAP GOES FOWARD DOWN AN INDEX CHAIN,
                IT KEEPS THE PREVIOUSLY READ BLOCKS IN CORE).

   2. <NAME> CATLG

      THIS WILL BE INTERPRETED AS REQUESTING THE CATALOG OF THE CURRENT
      "SYSRES" DEVICE.

           NOTE:

                 A DDCARD FOR "SYSRES" IS REQUIRED.

   3. <NAME> CATLG DSNAME<,VOL=VOLID>

      THIS  WILL START THE CATALOG LISTING AT DSNAME. THE DSNAME MAY BE
      FULLY  QUALIFIED OR MAY BE AN INDEX LEVEL; IT MAY BE A GDG MEMBER
      AND  MAY  BE GIVEN IN THE MANNER OF JCL (IE, OF THE FORM GDG(-1),
      ETC.)

      THIS INDICATES TO IEHMAP THAT DSNAME IS AN ALTERNATE CATALOG (IE,
      IT DOES NOT HAVE A DSNAME OF SYSCTLG), AND TELLS IEHMAP TO GIVE A
      CATLG LISTING OF IT.

      ALL  OPTIONS  VALID FOR CATLG CONTROL CARDS CAN BE SPECIFIED WITH
      CNAME=.

   5. <NAME> CATLG VOL=VOLID,OPT=NOPRINT

      THIS  GIVES THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE CATALOG ON VOLID THAT CATLG

 SPACE CONTROL CARD

   1. <NAME> SPACE VOL=VOLID

      THIS  REQUESTS THAT A LISTING OF ALL DATASETS AVAILABLE TO IEHMAP
      (VIA  DDCARDS  POINTING  TO  VOLUMES)  BE  GIVEN  BY  FIRST LEVEL
      QUALIFIER,  THAT A CHECK BE MADE FOR THEIR BEING CATALOGED IN THE
      CATALOG  ON  VOLID,  AND  A SPACE ACCOUNTING BE MADE OF THE TRACK
      ALLOCATION AND USEAGE.

      DATASETS  WHICH ARE CATALOGED BUT NOT AVAILABLE TO IEHMAP WILL BE
      FLAGGED WITH THE INDICATION:

      NOT ON VOLUME OR VOLUME NOT MOUNTED

   2. <NAME> SPACE VOL=(VOLID,VOLID,...)

      THIS  TELLS  IEHMAP  THAT A SPACE REPORT SHOULD BE GIVEN AND THAT
      MULTIPLE  CATALOGS  ARE  TO  BE  USED. THE CATALOGS ARE ON VOLID,

 USERID CONTROL CARD

   1. <NAME> USERID INDEX,VOL=VOLID

      THIS  REQUESTS  THAT A SPACE CONTROL CARD OUTPUT BE GIVEN FOR THE
      INDEX LEVEL GIVEN ON THE CONTROL CARD. A SPACE ACCOUNTING FOR ALL
      DATASETS  AVAILABLE  TO IEHMAP (VIA DDCARD'S) FOR THE INDEX LEVEL
      SPECIFIED  WILL  BE GIVEN. THE VOLID GIVEN IN THE VOL= OPERAND IS
      THE LOCATION OF THE CATALOG FOR THE INDEX GIVEN.

 DEPT CONTROL CARD

   1. <NAME> DEPT QUAL=QUALIFIER,VOL=VOLID

      THIS  REQUESTS THAT A SPACE CONTROL CARD OUTPUT BE GIVEN, BUT THE
      OUTPUT  SHOULD  BE  SEGMENTED  BY  DEPARTMENTS.  THE  SIZE OF THE
      DEPARTMENTAL  ID  IS  GIVEN  BY  THE  NUMBER OF CHARACTERS IN THE
      QUALIFIER;  IE,  THE  COUNT OF CHARACTERS DETERMINES WHERE IEHMAP
      SHOULD  START  ACCOUNTING  FOR  A  NEW  DEPARTMENT.  EG, QUAL=XXX
      SPECIFIES  THAT  THE  DEPARTMENTAL  IDENTIFIERS  ARE IN THE FIRST
      THREE CHARACTERS OF ALL INDICES.

   2. <NAME> DEPT QUAL=QUALIFIER,VOL=(VOLID,VOLID,...)

      THIS  REQUESTS  THAT  THE  DEPT  CONTROL CARD OUTPUT BE GIVEN FOR
      MULTIPLE CATALOGS. THE CATALOGS ARE ON VOLID, VOLID, ...

 FIXUP CONTROL CARD

   1. <NAME> FIXUP VOL=VOLID

         THIS TELLS IEHMAP TO MAKE AN ATTEMPT TO RECOVER MISSING TRACKS
      ON  VOLID.  THIS  IS  DONE  BY ADDING MISSING EXTENTS TO THE LAST
      FORMAT 5 IN THE FORMAT 5 CHAIN, AND IN ADDITION, ONE EXTRA FORMAT
      5  WILL  BE  BUILD  FROM A FORMAT 0. BY THIS MEANS, FROM 26 TO 51
      MISSING EXTENTS MAY BE RECOVERED.

         THE  OUTPUT  OF FIXUP IS THE SAME AS TWO TRACKS CONTROL CARDS.
      THE  FIRST  OUTPUT  SHOWS THE MISSING TRACKS THAT WERE FOUND, AND
      THE  ACTION  THAT  IEHMAP  TOOK  (REPLACED  OR NOT REPLACED). THE
      SECOND IS A NORMAL TRACKS OUTPUT SHOWING WHAT THE VTOC LOOKS LIKE
      AFTER THE FIXUP OPERATION.

 SORT CONTROL CARD

   1. <NAME> SORT VOL=VOLID

         THIS  REQUESTS  IEHMAP  TO MAKE A MORE ENCOMPASSING ATTEMPT TO
      RECOVER  MISSING  TRACKS THAN A FIXUP WILL DO. IEHMAP ATTEMPTS TO
      ARRANGE  THE MISSING TRACKS IN CCHHR ORDER IN THE FORMAT 5 CHAIN,
      THEN THE FORMAT 5 CHAIN IS REWRITTEN.

         THE  OUTPUT  OF  A  SORT  OPERATION  IS  THE  SAME AS A FIXUP;
      HOWEVER, ALL FREE SPACE WILL BE LISTED AS MISSING, AND THE ACTION
      IEHMAP TOOK WILL BE SHOWN.

         SORT SHOULD BE USED IF THE SECOND OUTPUT OF A FIXUP SHOWS THAT
      IEHMAP HAS CREATED MULTIPLE CONTIGUOUS EXTENTS, AND/OR THE VOLUME
      HAS  MORE  THAN  THREE  FORMATS  5.  BY  MULTIPLE CONTIGUOUS FREE
      EXTENTS  IS  MEANT  TWO  OR  MORE  CONTIGUOUS  EXTENTS  MARKED AS
      'AVAILABLE' ON THE SECOND OUTPUT OF FIXUP.

 SEND CONTROL CARD

   1. <NAME> SEND MESSAGE-TO-BE-SENT-TO-SYSTEM-OPERATOR

         THIS ALLOWS THE USER OF IEHMAP TO SEND A MESSAGE TO THE SYSTEM
      OPERATOR.  THIS COULD BE USED TO SUPPLY THE PASSWORD FOR A 'READ'
      PROTECTED DATASET DURING A PDS OPERATION, ETC.

         THE MESSAGE CANNOT BE CONTINUED BEYOND COLUMN 71; FOR MESSAGES
      LONGER  THAN THE ALLOWABLE LENGTH, MULTIPLE SEND CARDS WOULD HAVE
      TO BE USED.

         THERE  IS  NO LIMIT TO THE NUMBER OF SEND CARDS THAT CAN BE IN
      THE  IEHMAP  INPUT STREAM NOR THEIR PLACEMENT AS THEY ARE TREATED
      AS COMMENT CARDS (SEE BELOW).

 COMMENT CARDS

         COMMENTS  MAY BE INCLUDED IN THE IEHMAP INPUT STREAM BY HAVING
      AN  ASTERISK  (*)  IN  COLUMN  1.  THE COMMENT MAY BE EXTENDED TO
      COLUMN 80 AS NO CHECK OF THE CARD IS MADE.

         THERE  IS  NO LIMIT AS TO THE NUMBER OF COMMENT CARDS THAT MAY
      BE INCLUDED, NOR ON THEIR POSITIONING.

 PASS OPTION

   1. <NAME> OPERATION OPERAND1<,OPERAND2>,OPT=PASS

         THE  PASS  OPTION MAY BE SPECIFIED FOR PDS, TTR, DIR OR ATTRIB
      CONTROL  CARDS.  IF A DATASET IS PARTITIONED BUT IS PROTECTED FOR
      'READ'  (IE, PWREAD), IEHMAP WILL NOT ATTEMPT TO GIVE A PDS, TTR,
      DIR,  OR  ATTRIB  LISTING  FOR  THIS  DATASET UNLESS OPT=PASS WAS
      SPECIFIED.  THIS IS DONE TO MINIMIZE OPERATOR INTERVENTION DURING
      AN  IEHMAP  RUN.  IF A DATASET IS PROTECTED ONLY FOR 'WRITE' (IE,
      PWWRITE),  IEHMAP WILL OPEN IT AND GIVE THE DIRECTORY INFORMATION
      REQUESTED.

 TTR OPTION

   1. <NAME> ATTRIB OPERAND1,OPT=TTR

         THE  TTR  OPTION,  WHEN  SPECIFIED ON THE ATTRIB CONTROL CARD,
      WILL  GIVE  THE  SAME OUTPUT AS THE ATTRIB CONTROL CARD; HOWEVER,
      THE MEMBER NAMES WILL BE SORTED IN TTR ORDER NOT ALPHABETICAL.

 OTHER OPTIONS

   1. <NAME> OPERATION OPERAND1<,OPERAND2>,OPT=DUMP

         THE  DUMP  OPTION  MAY BE SPECIFIED ON MOST CONTROL CARDS. THE
      CONTROL  CARDS  ON  WHICH  IT  IS  MOST USEFUL ARE PDS, TTR, DIR,
      ATTRIB, AND CATLG.

         ON  THE  PO DATASET OPERATIONS, THE DSCB'S ASSOCIATED WITH THE
      DATASET WILL BE DUMPED, IN HEX, AFTER THE REQUESTED OUTPUT.

         ON  THE CATLG OPERATION, EACH CATALOG BLOCK WILL BE DUMPED, IN
      HEX,  AS  IT  IS READ; IE, THE CATALOG ENTRY FOLLOWING THE DUMPED
      CATALOG  BLOCK  MAY  NOT  BELONG  TO THAT BLOCK BUT MAY HAVE BEEN
      BUILT  FROM  UP  TO  22  PREVIOUS  BLOCKS  (THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF
      INDICES IN A CATALOGED DATASET NAME).

         THE  EQUIVALENT OF OPT=DUMP FOR A MAP CONTROL CARD IS THE DUMP
      CONTROL  CARD,  BUT  OPT=DUMP  MAY  BE SPECIFIED ON A MAP CONTROL
      CARD.

   2. <NAME> OPERATION OPERAND1<,OPERAND2>,OPT=AQUEUE

         THIS  SAYS  THAT  THE  OPEN, CLOSE, AND EOV ROUTINES HAVE BEEN
      MODIFIED TO SET A REFERENCE AND CHANGE DATE IN THE FORMAT 1 DSCB.
      THIS  REQUESTS  THAT  THE CREATION, REFERENCE AND CHANGE DATES BE
      FORMATTED IN PLACE OF THE VOLUME CREATED ON, THE DATASET SEQUENCE
      NUMBER, AND THE EXPIRATION DATE.

   3. <NAME > OPERATION OPERAND1<,OPERAND2>,OPT=NOPRINT

         THE NOPRINT OPTION MAY BE SPECIFIED ON MOST CONTROL CARDS. THE
      CONTROL CARDS ON WHICH IT IS MOST USEFUL ARE MAP AND CATLG.

         WHEN  NOPRINT  IS  SPECIFIED,  NO  DATASET INFORMATION WILL BE
      GIVEN; ONLY THE SUMMARIES WILL BE OUTPUTTED. THEREFORE, IT IS NOT
      ADVISABLE TO US OPT=NOPRINT ON PDS, ATTRIB, ETC. CONTROL CARDS.

                         PFXREF VERSION IV-B





                    A LOAD MODULE MAPPING PROGRAM





                        THIS WRITE-UP REVISED





                             APRIL 3,1975


1PFXREF: A LOAD MODULE MAPPING PROGRAM                        PAGE    2


                             INTRODUCTION


    PFXREF IS ANOTHER METAMORPHOSIS OF THE NUCREF PROGRAM (WHICH BECAME
 THE LMODMAP PROGRAM, AND IS NOW THE TYPE I SERVICE AID AMBLIST). IT IS
 AND  ALIAS  FOR,  AND AN INTEGRAL PART OF, THE PFAULT PROGRAM (QV). IT
 PRODUCES  OUTPUT  SUITABLE AS INPUT TO BOTH THE PULL PROGRAM (QV), AND
 THE TPATH PROGRAM (QV).

    SINCE  IT  IS  BASED  UPON  NUCREF  AND NOT AMBLIST, IT HAS CERTAIN
 RESTRICTIONS  THAT AMBLIST DOES NOT. EG, IT DOES NOT MAP A LOAD MODULE
 THAT  IS  IN OVERLAY FORMAT IN THE SAME MANNER AS DOES AMBLIST; IE, IT
 RECOGNIZES THAT THE LOAD MODULE IS IN OVERLAY, BUT IT DOES NOT SEGMENT
 THE  OUTPUT  AS DOES AMBLIST. HOWEVER, IT WILL GIVE SEGMENT NUMBERS IN
 ITS OUTPUT. THIS IS NOT A SERIOUS RESTRICTION AS PFXREF IS DESIGNED TO
 MAP  THE  NUCLEUS  AND MODULES IN THE FIXED, MODIFIED, AND/OR PAGEABLE
 LINK PACK AREA.

    ANOTHER  RESTRICTION  IS  PFXREF'S USEAGE OF CORE. TO KEEP THE CESD
 ITEMS IN CORE, IT DOES A VARIABLE CONDITIONAL GETMAIN FOR 64K (THIS IS
 SPLIT INTO TWO 32K BUFFERS); IF IT CANNOT GET ALL CESD ITEMS INTO THIS
 AMOUNT  OF CORE, IT DOUBLES THIS AND TRIES AGAIN. IF 128K IS STILL NOT
 ENOUGH, IT TERMINATES PROCESSING OF THE CURRENT CONTROL CARD.

    TO  DO ITS SORTS (BOTH THE CESD ITEMS AND THE CRLD ITEMS ARE SORTED
 BY ADDRESS AND ALPHABETICALLY), IT DOES VARIABLE CONDITIONAL GETMAIN'S
 FOR  40K;  IF  IT  CANNOT  OBTAIN  ANOTHER 40K BLOCK WHEN REQUIRED, IT
 TERMINATES.  SINCE  IT IS AN INTEGRAL PART OF PFAULT, THESE 40K BLOCKS
 ARE  RETAINED  FROM  ONE CONTROL CARD TO THE NEXT - THEY ARE PASSED TO
 PFAULT WHEN PFXREF HAS FINISHED PROCESSING.

    CURRENTLY, THESE TWO RESTRICTIONS ON CORE SIZE DO NOT SEEM TO CAUSE
 SERIOUS  PROBLEMS - TWO 400K NUCLEI, WITH APPROXIMATELY 1200 ESD ITEMS
 APIECE, WERE MAPPED SUCCESSFULLY IN LESS THAN 500K.

    CURRENTLY,  PFXREF  DOES NOT GIVE ANY DATA ON THE AMOUNT OF CORE IT
 HAS USED FOR BUFFERS AND SORTING.

    PFXREF  RUNS  AS A PROBLEM PROGRAM UNDER VS AND REQUIRES NO CHANGES
 TO BE MADE TO VS.

    PFXREF  MAY  BE  INVOKED  IN  THE  STANDARD WAY, PASSING PARAMETERS
 AND/OR ALTERNATE DDNAME'S...SEE THE UTILITIES SRL.

                BE  USED  TO  SET  THE LINE COUNT PER PAGE. THE DEFAULT
                LINE COUNT IS 56.

                NOTE:

                      IF  AN  INVALID  LINE  COUNT  IS PASSED TO PFXREF
                           (LESS  THAN  10  OR  GREATER  THAN 999), THE
                           DEFAULT  LINE  COUNT  (56)  WILL BE USED. AN
                           ERROR MESSAGE WILL BE ISSUED; IT WILL APPEAR
                           IN THE USER'S JCL.

           NOEND THIS SPECIFIES THAT PFXREF SHOULD NOT PRODUCE THE 'END
                OF MODULE' CARD IN THE PUNCHED OUTPUT (SEE APPENDIX I).

           KVT THIS SPECIFIES THAT PFXREF SHOULD PRODUCE PUNCHED OUTPUT
                SIMILAR TO THE NUCPUNCH PROGRAM (QV), ALSO SEE APPENDIX
                I.

           NOEP  THIS  SPECIFIES  THAT  ENTRY POINT CARDS SHOULD NOT BE
                PUNCHED.

           EPS  THIS  SPECIFIES  THAT  ONLY ENTRY POINT CARDS SHOULD BE
                PUNCHED.

           C  (SYSOUT  CLASS)  IS ANY ALPHA CHARACTER FROM A THRU Z, OR
                ANY NUMERIC CHARACTER FROM 0 THRU 9.

                NOTE:

                      FOR  PROPER  OUTPUT,  PFXREF  REQUIRES  A PRINTER
                           HAVING  AT  LEAST  132 POSITIONS AND A PN OR
                           EQUIVALENT TRAIN/CHAIN.

           BBBBB  (BLKSIZE FOR SYSUT2) IS ANY MULTIPLE OF 137 UP TO AND
                INCLUDING  FULL-TRACK  BLOCKING.  THE LRECL IS 137; THE
                DEFAULT BLOCKSIZE IS 3509. THE RECFM IS VBA.

           SSSSS  (BLKSIZE  FOR SYSIN AND SYSIN2) IS ANY MULTIPLE OF 80
                UP  TO  AND INCLUDING FULL-TRACK BLOCKING. THE LRECL IS
                80. THE DEFAULT BLOCKING FACTOR IS 1.

           PPPPP  (BLKSIZE  FOR SYSPUNCH AND SYSOUT) IS ANY MULTIPLE OF
                80 UP TO AND INCLUDING FULL-TRACK BLOCKING. THE DEFAULT
                BLOCKSIZE IS 80.

           ZZZZZ  (BLKSIZE FOR SYSLIB) NEED NOT BE GIVEN ON THE DDCARD;
                IT IS ONLY USED FOR REGION CALCULATION.

           XXXX  (REGION SIZE) CAN BE DETERMINED, APPROXIMATELY, BY THE
                FOLLOWING FORMULA:

                XXXX  = 128K + (2*SSSSS +2*BBBBB +ZZZZZ +2*PPPPP +4096)
                     / 1024)K


     SYSUT2  THIS  IS  THE  PRIMARY  OUTPUT OF PFXREF. IT IS A REQUIRED
          DDCARD.

     SYSPUNCH  THIS  IS  THE  SECONDARY  OUTPUT  OF PFXREF. IT IS NOT A
          REQUIRED DDCARD. SEE APPENDIX I FOR OUTPUT CARD FORMAT.

     SYSOUT  THIS IS A SECONDARY OUTPUT OF PFXREF. IT IS NOT A REQUIRED
          DDCARD. SEE APPENDIX I FOR OUTPUT CARD FORMAT.

     SYSLIB  THIS  IS  THE  PRIMARY INPUT TO PFXREF. THIS IS A REQUIRED
          DDCARD.

     SYSIN THIS IS THE PRIMARY CONTROL CARD DATASET FOR PFXREF. THIS OR
          SYSIN2 IS A REQUIRED DDCARD.

     SYSIN2  THIS IS AN ALTERNATE CONTROL CARD DATASET FOR PFXREF. THIS
          OR SYSIN IS A REQUIRED DDCARD.

     STEPLIB  THIS  IS  A LIBRARY ON THE TSO A-QUEUE WHICH CONTAINS THE
          CURRENT  VERSION  OF PFXREF. THIS WOULD BE USED TO RUN ON THE
          TSO A-QUEUE.

                NOTE:

                      FOR  A FULLER EXPLANATION OF THE DDCARD'S USED BY
                           PFXREF, SEE APPENDIX III.

    CONTROL  CARDS  FOR  PFXREF,  IN  THE SYSIN DATASET, HAVE A SIMPLE,
 FIXED FORMAT:

              NAME <RELOCATION> <IEANUC>

    CONTROL  CARDS  FOR  PFXREF,  IN THE SYSIN2 DATASET, HAVE A SIMPLE,
 FIXED FORMAT:

              RELOCATION NAME <COMMENTS>

      NAME THIS IS THE NAME OF THE MEMBER TO BE MAPPED; THIS OPERAND IS
           REQUIRED.  IT  MUST  START  IN COLUMN ONE (1) OF THE CONTROL
           CARD  IF  THE DATASET IS SYSIN, OR IN COLUMN SIXTEEN (16) OF
           THE CONTROL CARD IF THE DATASET IS SYSIN2.

      RELOCATION  THIS IS AN OPTIONAL RELOCATION FACTOR TO BE USED WHEN
           PRODUCING  THE  LOAD  MODULE  MAP  AND THE PUNCHED OUTPUT IN
           SYSPUNCH.  IF  THE  CONTROL  CARD  DATASET  IS  SYSIN,  THIS
           RELOCATION  FACTOR  MUST  START  IN  COLUMN  TEN (10) OF THE
           CONTROL  CARD,  MUST BE SIX (6) HEXIDECIMAL DIGITS LONG, AND
           MUST HAVE LEADING ZEROES SUPPLIED.

      IF  THE DATASET IS SYSIN2, THE RELOCATION FACTOR IS NOT OPTIONAL.
           IT  MUST  START IN COLUMN ONE (1) OF THE CONTROL CARD AND BE
           SIX  (6)  HEXIDECIMAL  DIGITS  LONG  WITH  LEADING ZEROES IF
           NECESSARY. CONTROL CARDS IN THE SYSIN2 DATASET HAVE THE FORM
           OF PFXREF OR MAPLPA OUTPUT. THUS ENABLING THE USER OF PFXREF
           TO SUPPLY MAPLPA OUTPUT CARDS AS INPUT.

      IEANUC  THIS IS A KEYWORD INDICATING TO PFXREF THAT THE MODULE TO
           BE MAPPED IS A NUCLEUS THAT DOES NOT HAVE A NAME IN THE FORM
           IEANUC0X.  THIS IS A POSITIONAL PARAMETER AND MUST APPEAR IN
           COLUMN EIGHTEEN (18) OF THE CARD. THIS CANNOT BE SUPPLIED IF
           THE DATASET IS SYSIN2.

      IF THE CONTROL CARD DATASET IS SYSIN2, COMMENTS MAY APPEAR ON THE
           CONTROL CARDS STARTING IN COLUMN TWENTY-FIVE (25).

      COMMENT  CARDS  (*  IN COLUMN 1) CAN APPEAR ANYWHERE IN THE INPUT
           STREAM.  THERE  IS NO LIMIT UPON THE NUMBER OF COMMENT CARDS
           THAT  CAN BE IN THE INPUT STREAM NOR ON THEIR PLACEMENT; IE,
           COMMENT  CARDS  MAY BE PLACED BEFORE OR AFTER CONTROL CARDS.
           HOWEVER,  IF PLACED AFTER CONTROL CARDS, THEY WILL BE LISTED
           WITH THE NEXT CONTROL CARD.

      IF  AN  ERROR  IS  DETECTED IN A CONTROL CARD, AN ATTEMPT WILL BE
           MADE  TO  INDICATE  THE LOCATION OF THE ERROR BY PLACING A $
           UNDER  THE  POSITION  IN  THE PRINT LINE WHERE THE ERROR WAS
           FOUND.

           -DDNAME

      THIS  IS  A SPECIAL CONTROL CARD WHICH TELLS PFXREF TO CHANGE THE
           DDNAME  OF  THE INPUT PDS FROM SYSLIB TO THE DDNAME GIVEN ON
           THE  CONTROL CARD AFTER THE HYPHEN. THE DDNAME MUST START IN
           COLUMN  TWO  (2) OF THE CONTROL CARD AND MUST BE PADDED WITH
           BLANKS  TO  EIGHT (8) CHARACTERS. THE HYPHEN (-) MUST APPEAR
           IN COLUMN ONE (1) OF THE CONTROL CARD.

           =DATA

      THIS  IS  A  SPECIAL  CONTROL CARD WHICH TELLS PFXREF TO COPY THE
           CONTROL CARD TO THE SYSPUNCH DATASET WITH ONE CHANGE --- THE
           EQUAL SIGN (=) IS REPLACED WITH A DOLLAR SIGN ($). THIS IS A
           MEANS  OF SUPPLYING CONTROL CARDS TO THE TPATH PROGRAM (QV),
           SUCH AS $SETASID=.


1PFXREF: A LOAD MODULE MAPPING PROGRAM                        PAGE    7


      PFXREF'S PRIMARY OUTPUT IS FOUR LISTINGS OF THE LOAD MODULE TO BE
           MAPPED:

           1.  A  LINKAGE  EDITOR  LIKE  MAP OF THE ESD ITEMS SORTED BY
                ADDRESS. IF THE MODULE HAS PSEUDO REGISTERS, THESE WILL
                APPEAR  AFTER  THE  SORTED  ESD  LISTING;  THEY WILL BE
                SORTED  BY  ADDRESS  ALSO.  IF  THE  LOAD  MODULE IS IN
                OVERLAY, THE SEGMENT NUMBER WILL APPEAR TO THE RIGHT OF
                THE CSECT NAME.

           2.  A  LINKAGE  EDITOR  LIKE  MAP OF THE RLD ITEMS SORTED BY
                ADDRESS  GIVING  THE  TYPE  OF REFERENCE; IE, V-4+ IS A
                FOUR  BYTE VCON WHICH HAS A POSITIVE RELOCATION FACTOR.
                AN  IDENTIFIER  OF  C-X INDICATES THAT THIS IS THE AREA
                WHICH  HAS  REQUESTED  THE  ACCUMULATED  LENGTH  OF THE
                PSEUDO  REGISTERS;  IT WILL BE IDENTIFIED BY THE 'NAME'
                $ACCUM.

           3.  A  LINKAGE  EDITOR  LIKE  MAP  OF  THE  ESD ITEMS SORTED
                ALPHABETICALLY  BY  NAME. IF THE MODULE CONTAINS PSEUDO
                REGISTERS,  THEY  WILL  APPEAR  AFTER  THE  SORTED  ESD
                LISTING;  THEY  WILL  BE SORTED ALPHABETICALLY ALSO. IF
                THE  LOAD MODULE IS IN OVERLAY, THE SEGMENT NUMBER WILL
                APPEAR TO THE RIGHT OF THE CSECT NAME.

           4.  A  LINKAGE  EDITOR  LIKE  MAP  OF  THE  RLD ITEMS SORTED
                ALPHABETICALLY  BY  THE  REFERENCED  CSECT/ENTRY  POINT
                GIVING  THE TYPE OF REFERENCE; IE, A-3+ IS A THREE BYTE
                ADCON WITH A POSITIVE RELOCATION FACTOR.

      AT  THE  END  OF  EACH  LISTING,  THE LOAD MODULE'S LENGTH, ENTRY
           POINT, OPTIONAL RELOCATION FACTOR, THE NUMBER OF CSECTS, THE
           NUMBER  OF  ENTRY  POINTS,  AND  THE  NUMBER  OF  UNRESOLVED
           REFERENCES (IF ANY) WILL BE GIVEN.

      IF THE LOAD MODULE TO BE MAPPED IS A NUCLEUS, THE FIRST CESD ITEM
           (HOPEFULLY  IEAVNIP0  OR  IEAANIP0) WILL BE RELOCATED TO THE
           END  OF  THE  MODULE,  AND  ALL  REFERENCES  TO  IT, AND ALL
           REFERENCES  FROM  IT,  WILL BE APPROPRIATELY CHANGED. AT THE
           END OF EACH LISTING, NIP'S ADDRESS WILL BE GIVEN.

      IF  A RELOCATION FACTOR IS GIVEN, ALL ADDRESSES WILL BE RELOCATED
           BY  THIS  FACTOR;  EG, IF A RELOCATION FACTOR OF E8B000 WERE
           GIVEN,  THE  FIRST  ESD  ITEM  IN  THE  ADDRESS MAP WOULD BE
           LOCATED AT E8B000 RATHER THAN AT 00.

      IF  THE  LOAD  MODULE IS IN OVERLAY, THE UNOVERLAY LENGTH WILL BE
           GIVEN AT THE END OF EACH LISTING.

      IF  THE  SYSPUNCH  DDCARD  IS  PRESENT,  CARDS,  AS  DESCRIBED IN
           APPENDIX  I,  WILL  BE  PRODUCED. THE SYSPUNCH DDCARD IS NOT
           REQUIRED.

      IF  THE SYSOUT DDCARD IS PRESENT, WHENEVER THERE IS AN ERROR IN A
           MEMBER  OF  THE INPUT PDS, SUCH AS NO ESD ITEMS, A CARD WILL
           BE  PUNCHED  IN  THE  SYSOUT  DATASET THAT CONTAINS THE LOAD
           MODULE'S  RELOCATION  FACTOR  IN  COLUMN  1,  AND  THE  LOAD
           MODULE'S NAME IN COLUMN 16.

      THE  'IN  CORE  OUTPUT'  FOR  THE  PFAULT  PROGRAM WILL ALWAYS BE
           PRODUCED. FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THIS DATA, SEE APPENDIX IV.

                         THE SYSPUNCH DATASET


      PFXREF PRODUCES CARDS WITH THE FOLLOWING FORMAT:

           COLUMNS 1 THRU 6 - CSECT OR ENTRY START ADDRESS
           COLUMN 7 - THE MAJOR NAME FLAG
           COLUMNS 10 THRU 15 - CSECT LENGTH
           COLUMNS 16 THRU 23 - CSECT/ENTRY NAME
           COLUMN 24 - THE LENGTH FLAG
           COLUMN 25 - THE RELOCATION FLAG
           COLUMN 32 - THE MEMBER NAME
           COLUMN 50 - SEGMENT NUMBER, IF OVERLAY
           COLUMN 73 - SEQUENCE NUMBER

      COLUMNS  1  THRU  6  CONTAIN THE CSECT START ADDRESS OR THE ENTRY
           POINT  ADDRESS  IN  HEXIDECIMAL, SIX CHARACTERS WITH LEADING
           ZEROES.

      COLUMN 7 CONTAINS AN ASTERISK (*) IF THE CARD HAS A MAJOR NAME IN
           COLUMNS  16  THRU  23.  A  MAJOR NAME IS A CSECT NAME. ENTRY
           POINTS  IN  A  CSECT  WILL  NOT HAVE THE MAJOR FLAG ON, THUS
           INDICATING  AN  ENTRY  POINT. IF THE NOEP PARAMETER HAS BEEN
           SPECIFIED, ENTRY POINT CARDS WILL NOT BE PRODUCED.

      COLUMNS  10  THRU 15 CONTAIN THE CSECT LENGTH. THIS IS TAKEN FROM
           THE CESD ITEMS READ INTO CORE. ENTRY POINT CARDS PRODUCED BY
           PFXREF WILL HAVE BLANKS IN THIS FIELD.

      COLUMNS  16  THRU  23  CONTAIN  THE  CSECT OR ENTRY POINT NAME IN
           EBCDIC, EIGHT CHARACTERS WITH TRAILING BLANKS.

      COLUMN  24  CONTAINS  AN  ASTERISK (*) INDICATING THAT COLUMNS 10
           THRU  15  CONTAIN A LENGTH IF THE CARD IS A MAJOR NAME. THIS
           FIELD WILL CONTAIN A BLANK FOR ENTRY POINTS.

      COLUMN 25 CONTAINS AN ASTERISK (*) INDICATING THAT COLUMNS 1 THRU
           6  HAVE  BEEN RELOCATED IF A RELOCATION FACTOR WAS SPECIFIED
           BY THE USER.

      THE  FIRST  CARD  PRODUCED BY PFXREF IN THE SYSPUNCH DATASET IS A
           COMMENT  CARD  CONTAINING THE DAY, DATE, AND TIME PFXREF WAS
           EXECUTED.

      IF  THE  NOEND  PARAMETER  HAS  NOT  BEEN  SPECIFIED, PFXREF WILL
           PRODUCE  AN  'END OF MODULE' CARD WHICH HAS AN ADDRESS EQUAL
           TO  THE  LAST  BYTE  OF  THE MODULE WITH A NAME OF $$$$XXXX;
           WHERE XXXX IS THE LAST FOUR CHARACTERS OF THE MODULE'S NAME.

      IF  THE KVT PARAMETER HAS BEEN SPECIFIED IN THE PARM FIELD OF THE
           EXEC  CARD,  PFXREF  WILL  PRODUCE  CARDS WITH THE FOLLOWING
           FORMAT:

           COLUMNS 1 THRU 6 - CSECT START ADDRESS
           COLUMN 7 - THE MAJOR NAME FLAG
           COLUMNS 10 THRU 15 - CSECT ENDING ADDRESS
           COLUMNS 16 THRU 23 - CSECT NAME
           COLUMN 25 - THE RELOCATION FLAG
           COLUMN 32 - THE MEMBER NAME
           COLUMN 50 - SEGMENT NUMBER, IF OVERLAY
           COLUMN 73 - SEQUENCE NUMBER

      COLUMNS 1 THRU 6 CONTAIN THE CSECT START ADDRESS, IN HEXIDECIMAL,
           SIX CHARACTERS WITH LEADING ZEROES.

      COLUMN  7 CONTAINS AN ASTERISK (*) INDICATING THAT THE CARD HAS A
           MAJOR  NAME  IN  COLUMNS 16 THRU 23. A MAJOR NAME IS A CSECT
           NAME.

      COLUMNS  10 THRU 15 CONTAIN THE CSECT ENDING ADDRESS. THIS IS THE
           CSECT  START  ADDRESS  PLUS  THE CSECT LENGTH TAKEN FROM THE
           CESD ITEMS READ INTO CORE.

      COLUMNS  16  THRU  23  CONTAIN  THE  CSECT  NAME IN EBCDIC, EIGHT
           CHARACTERS WITH TRAILING BLANKS.

      COLUMN  24  CONTAINS  A  BLANK INDICATING THAT COLUMNS 10 THRU 15
           CONTAIN AN ENDING ADDRESS.

      COLUMN 25 CONTAINS AN ASTERISK (*) INDICATING THAT COLUMNS 1 THRU
           6  HAVE  BEEN RELOCATED IF A RELOCATION FACTOR WAS SPECIFIED
           BY THE USER.

      WHEN  THE  KVT  PARAMETER IS SPECIFIED, ENTRY POINT CARDS ARE NOT
           PRODUCED BY PFXREF; ALSO, NO COMMENT CARDS WILL BE PRODUCED.

                         DDCARD'S FOR PFXREF


   SYSUT2  THIS IS THE PRIMARY OUTPUT OF PFXREF. IT HAS A RECORD FORMAT
        OF  VARIABLE  BLOCKED  WITH  ASA  CONTROL CHARACTERS, A LOGICAL
        RECORD  LENGTH  OF  137,  AND  A DEFAULT BLOCKSIZE OF 3509. THE
        BLOCKSIZE  CAN BE OVERRIDDEN VIA THE DDCARD. SYSUT2 CONTAINS AN
        ECHO  OF  THE  CONTROL CARD FROM SYSIN, ANY ERROR MESSAGES, AND
        THE FORMATTED OUTPUT OF THE SORT ROUTINES.

   SYSLIB  THIS  IS  THE  PRIMARY  INPUT TO PFXREF. IT IS A LOAD MODULE
        DATASET  (SUCH  AS  SYS1.LPALIB)  WHICH  CONTAINS THE MEMBER OR
        MEMBERS  TO  BE  MAPPED. IT MUST HAVE A DATASET ORGANIZATION OF
        PARTITIONED  (PO),  A RECORD FORMAT OF UNDEFINED, THE BLOCKSIZE
        CAN  BE  UP  TO  FULL-TRACK  BLOCKING.  IT CAN BE ON ANY DIRECT
        ACCESS  DEVICE SUPPORTED BY THE BASIC PARTITIONED ACCESS METHOD
        (BPAM). THE DDNAME SYSLIB MAY BE CHANGED VIA THE - CONTROL CARD
        (-DDNAME).

   SYSPUNCH  THIS  IS  THE  SECONDARY OUTPUT OF PFXREF. IT HAS A RECORD
        FORMAT  OF  FIXED BLOCKED, A LOGICAL RECORD LENGTH OF 80, AND A
        DEFAULT  BLOCKSIZE  OF  80. THE BLOCKSIZE MAY BE OVERRIDDEN VIA
        THE DDCARD. IT WILL CONTAIN THE CARDS AS DEFINED IN APPENDIX I.
        THIS  IS  NOT  A  REQUIRED  DDCARD;  IE, IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE
        PUNCHED OUTPUT OF PFXREF, A DD DUMMY CARD IS NOT REQUIRED.

   SYSOUT  THIS IS A SECONDARY OUTPUT OF PFXREF. IT HAS A RECORD FORMAT
        OF  FIXED BLOCKED, A LOGICAL RECORD LENGTH OF 80, AND A DEFAULT
        BLOCKSIZE  OF  80.  THE  BLOCKSIZE  MAY  BE  OVERRIDDEN VIA THE
        DDCARD.  IT  WILL  CONTAIN  CARDS  AS DEFINED IN APPENDIX I FOR
        THOSE  MEMBERS OF THE INPUT PDS WHICH HAD ERRORS. THIS IS NOT A
        REQUIRED DDCARD.

   SYSIN  THIS IS THE PRIMARY CONTROL CARD DATASET FOR PFXREF. IT HAS A
        RECORD  FORMAT OF FIXED BLOCKED, A LOGICAL RECORD LENGTH OF 80,
        AND  A DEFAULT BLOCKSIZE OF 80. THE BLOCKSIZE MAY BE OVERRIDDEN

1SUPERZAP VERSION 7: A TERMINAL ORIENTED SUPERZAP             PAGE    2


    SUPERZAP  VERSION  7  INCLUDES SEVERAL CHANGES THAT MAKE THE USE OF
 THIS VERSION OF SUPERZAP FROM THE TERMINAL EASIER. THESE CHANGES ARE:

         1. SEVERAL NEW CONTROL CARDS
         2. CHANGED FORMAT OF OUTPUT
         3. ABBREVIATED CONTROL WORDS

         THE NEW CONTROL CARDS THAT HAVE BEEN ADDED ARE:

              DDNAME
              QUIT
              TERM
              NOGO
              ABSENT
              PEEK
              SEND

         A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF EACH FOLLOWS.

    1. DYNAMIC SYSLIB CHANGE

         DDNAME CONTROL CARD

           THIS ENABLES THE USER OF SUPERZAP TO CHANGE THE LIBRARY THAT
      HE  IS  WORKING  WITH  WITHOUT  HAVING TO RE-INVOKE SUPERZAP. THE
      CURRENT  LIBRARY  IS CLOSED. A SEARCH OF THE TIOT IS MADE FOR THE
      DDNAME  ON  THE  DDNAME  CONTROL CARD, AND IF FOUND, AN OBTAIN IS
      ISSUED  FOR  THE DSNAME. IF THE OBTAIN IS SUCCESSFUL, THE DATASET
      IS OPENED FOR INPUT. THE OPENING OF THE DATASET FOR INPUT ENABLES
      THE  USER  OF  SUPERZAP TO LOOK AT MEMBERS OF THE LIBRARY WITHOUT
      HAVING THE SYSTEM OPERATOR REPLY TO DATE PROTECTED DATASETS.

 2. STOP REPRINT OPTION

      QUIT CONTROL CARD

           THIS  ENABLES  THE  TERMINAL  USER  OF  SUPERZAP TO STOP THE
      REPRINTING OF SYSIN INPUT TO SYSPRINT, BOTH OF WHICH ARE ASSIGNED
      TO  THE  TERMINAL.  THE  REPRINTING  IS  UNNECESSARY,  AND  OFTEN
      ANNOYING.

 3. TERMINAL NOTIFICATION

      TERM CONTROL CARD

           THIS  ENABLES THE USER OF SUPERZAP TO TELL SUPERZAP THAT HIS
      OUTPUT IS GOING TO A TERMINAL, AND THAT THE OUTPUT OF A DUMPT AND
      PEEKT  SHOULD  BE REARRANGED TO HAVE THE EBCDIC ON THE LEFT. THIS
      IS  DONE  TO  MINIMIZE  THE TIME REQUIRED TO PRINT A LINE, AS ANY
      LINE WHICH DOES NOT HAVE MNEMONICS ON IT WILL STOP PRINTING AFTER
      THE EBCDIC HAS BEEN PRINTED.


1SUPERZAP VERSION 7: A TERMINAL ORIENTED SUPERZAP             PAGE    3


 4. ERROR CONTROL

      THE NORMAL MODE OF OPERATION OF SUPERZAP IS, ON AN ERROR, TO DUMP
 THE   WHOLE   WORKS  TO  SYSPRINT.  TO  THE  TERMINAL  USER,  THIS  IS
 DISASTEROUS. TO OFFSET THIS, TWO CONTROL CARDS HAVE BEEN ADDED:

           NOGO
           ABSENT

      A. VERIFY REJECT

           NOGO CONTROL CARD

                THIS CONTROLS SUPERZAP'S OPERATION WHEN A VERIFY REJECT
           OCCURS. THERE ARE TWO KEYWORDS FOR THIS CONTROL CARD:

                NODUMP
                DUMP T

           NODUMP TELLS SUPERZAP THAT YOU DO NOT WANT A DUMP OF A CSECT
                ON A VERIFY REJECT.

           DUMP T   TELLS  SUPERZAP THAT YOU WANT A DUMP T  ON A VERIFY
                REJECT.  THE  T  DETERMINES THE KIND OF A DUMP YOU WILL
                GET, A STRAIGHT HEX DUMP OR A TRANSLATED ONE.

      B. MISSING CSECT NAME

           ABSENT CONTROL CARD

                THIS  CONTROLS  THE  OPERATION OF SUPERZAP WHEN A CSECT
           NAME  IS  NOT  FOUND  IN  A  LOAD MODULE. THE NORMAL MODE OF
           OPERATION  OF  SUPERZAP  IS  TO  DUMP ALL CSECTS IN THE LOAD
           MODULE.  ABSENT MODIFIES THIS IN TWO WAYS; IE, THERE ARE TWO
           KEYWORDS FOR THE ABSENT CONTROL CARD.

                NAME/NONAME
                DUMP/NODUMP

           THE  NAME  AND  NONAME  KEYWORDS  DETERMINE WHETHER THE USER
                WANTS  THE  NAMES  OF  CSECTS 'DUMPED' TO THE TERMINAL.
                NAME  SAYS  LIST THE NAMES OF ALL CSECTS IN THE MODULE;
                NONAME SAYS DO NOT LIST THE NAMES OF THE CSECTS.

           THE  DUMP  AND  NODUMP  KEYWORDS  DETERMINE WHETHER THE USER
                WANTS A DUMP OF ALL THE CSECTS IN THE MODULE. DUMP SAYS

 5. SSI BYTES OPTIONS

      LOCAL CONTROL CARD.

           MANY  INSTALLATIONS  HAVE  BEGUN  USING THE SSI BYTES OF THE
      DIRECTORY  TO CONTAIN INFORMATION PERTENANT TO THAT INSTALLATION;
      THRERFORE,  THE AUTOMATIC SETTING OF THE 'LOCAL MODIFICATION BIT'
      BY   SUPERZAP  WHENEVER  A  REP  IS  ACCOMPLISHED  DESTROYS  THAT
      INFORMATION.  TO  OVERCOME THIS, SUPERZAP VERSION 7 HAS THE LOCAL
      CONTROL CARD. THE LOCAL CONTROL CARD HAS TWO KEYWORDS:

           SETSSI
           NOSSI

           SETSSI  SAYS  THAT YOU WANT THE 'LOCAL MODIFICATION BIT' SET
                TO ONE AFTER A SUCCESSFUL REP OPERATION.

           NOSSI SAYS THAT YOU DO NOT WANT THE 'LOCAL MODIFICATION BIT'
                SET TO ONE AFTER A SUCCESSFUL REP OPERATION.

 6. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

      HEADINGS

           TWO  HEADINGS  HAVE  BEEN  ADDED  BY SUPERZAP VERSION 7. THE
      FIRST  GIVES  THE VOLUME THE LIBRARY IS ON, THE LIBRARY NAME, THE
      TIME  AND DATE THAT THE 'ZAP' IS BEING DONE. THE SECOND GIVES THE
      SETTING  OF  THE  ABSENT, NOGO, AND LOCAL SWITCHES AS WELL AS THE
      LINE COUNT BEING USED.

 7. REPLACEMENT INFORMATION

      PEEK T  CONTROL CARD

           SINCE  THE  DUMPING  OF  CSECTS (ON A VERIFY REJECT) AND THE
      LISTING  OF  CSECT  NAMES  (ON  AN ABSENT CSECT) IS OPTIONAL WITH
      SUPERZAP VERSION 7, A NEW CONTROL CARD HAS BEEN ADDED TO GIVE THE
      USER THE ABILITY TO LOOK AT CERTAIN PARTS OF A CSECT. THIS IS THE
      PEEK T  CONTROL CARD. THE FORMAT OF THE PEEK T  CONTROL CARD IS:

           PEEK T  OFFSET SIZE

           THE  OFFSET IS THE ADDRESS YOU WANT TO LOOK AT. THIS WILL BE
                ROUNDED DOWN TO THE NEAREST DOUBLE WORD BOUNDARY.

           THE  SIZE  IS  THE  NUMBER  OF  BYTES (IN HEX) TO PRINT. THE
                DEFAULT IS 10 HEX (16 DECIMAL).

           THE  OPTIONAL T DETERMINES WHETHER IT WILL BE A STRAIGHT HEX
                DUMP  OR IF THE OPTIONAL TRANSLATION WILL BE DONE. PEEK
                REQUESTS  A  STRAIGHT  HEX  DUMP,  PEEKT  REQUESTS  THE
                TRANSLATION OPTION.

 8. STOPPING SUPERZAP VERSION 7

      .END CONTROL CARD


1SUPERZAP VERSION 7: A TERMINAL ORIENTED SUPERZAP             PAGE    5


           SINCE  IT  IS  DIFFICULT  TO  GO  TO UPPERCASE FOR THE /* TO
      INDICATE  THE  END  OF  SUPERZAP INPUT, A LOWER CASE CONTROL CARD
      .END (.END) HAS BEEN ADDED TO INDICATE THE END OF SUPERZAP INPUT.
      THE /* MAY STILL BE USED, BUT LOWERCASE IS EASIER.

 9. OPERATOR COMMUNICATION

      SEND CONTROL CARD

           SINCE  IT  IS  AT  TIMES DESIRABLE TO BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE
      WITH  THE  SYSTEM OPERATOR, THE SEND CONTROL CARD HAS BEEN ADDED;
      THIS  ENABLES THE USER OF SUPERZAP TO SEND MESSAGES TO THE SYSTEM
      OPERATOR. THE FORMAT OF THE SEND CONTROL CARD IS:

           SEND MESSAGE-TO-SEND-TO-THE-OPERATOR

           THE  MESSAGE  NEED  NOT  BE  ENCLOSED IN QUOTES (IN FACT, IF
      QUOTES ARE USED, THEY WILL BE SENT TO THE OPERATOR AS PART OF THE
      MESSAGE);  ANY  LEADING  AND  TRAILING BLANKS WILL BE REMOVED. AS
      WITH  OTHER  SUPERZAP CONTROL CARDS, THE SEND CONTROL CARD CANNOT
      BE CONTINUED NOR CAN IT EXTEND BEYOUN COLUMN 72.

 NOTES:

      1.  ALL  INPUT  TO  SUPERZAP MAY BE IN LOWERCASE, SUPERZAP AND/OR
         TCAM WILL FOLD THE INPUT TO UPPERCASE.

      2.  MOST  OF  THE CONTROL CARD OPERATIONS AND MANY OF THE KEYWORD
         OPERANDS  MAY  BE  ENTERED  IN  ABBREVIATED  FORM. THE LIST OF
         ABBREVIATIONS FOLLOWS:

                A......ABSDUMP
                AT.....ABSDUMPT
                B......BASE

                V......VERIFY
                .E......END

      3.  THE  FORMAT  OF  SOME INPUT TO SUPERZAP HAS BEEN MODIFIED FOR
         EASIER USE AND COMPATIBILITY; HOWEVER, THE OLD, TYPE I, FORMAT
         IS STILL ACCEPTABLE.

                A.  COMMAS  ARE  EQUIVALENT  TO BLANKS WHERE BLANKS ARE
                   DELIMITERS; IE, V 10,47F0,B002 IS EQUIVALENT TO V 10
                   47F0,B002.

                B.  OFFSETS  DO  NOT HAVE TO HAVE LEADING ZEROES; IE, V
                   AB2 IS EQUIVALENT TO V 0AB2

                C.  ABSOLUTE  DISK ADDRESSES (CCHHR'S) MAY BE DELIMITED
                   BY  PERIODS  (.)  FOR  EASE  OF  COUNTING STRINGS OF
                   ZEROES;  IE,  AT  0005.0000.01  IS  EQUIVALENT TO AT
                   0005000001

 4. THE MESSAGE ZAP020I VERIFIED HAS BEEN ADDED TO NOTIFY THE USER THAT
    A  VER  OPERATION HAS BEEN PERFORMED SUCCESSFULLY. THIS IS ORIENTED
    TO  USERS  OF  TSOZAP AS IT HAS BEEN ZAPPED TO BE INITIALLY IN TERM
    AND  QUIT  MODE;  HOWEVER,  AT  PRESENT,  THIS MESSAGE IS ISSUED BY
    SUPERZAP VERSION 7 IN THE BACKGROUND AS NO CHECK IS MADE FOR QUIT.

                         MAPLPA VERSION III-A





                   A LINK PACK AREA MAPPING PROGRAM





                        THIS WRITE-UP REVISED





                          FEBRUARY 27, 1975


1MAPLPA: A LINK PACK AREA MAPPING PROGRAM                     PAGE    2


                             INTRODUCTION


    MAPLPA  IS A PROGRAM THAT PRODUCES A LINK PACK AREA MAP SORTED BOTH
 ALPHABETICALLY  AND  BY  ADDRESS.  IT  ALSO  PRODUCES  CARDS WHICH ARE
 SUITABLE  AS INPUT TO BOTH THE TPATH PROGRAM (QV) AND THE PULL PROGRAM
 (QV).

    MAPLPA  RUNS  AS A PROBLEM PROGRAM UNDER VS AND REQUIRES NO CHANGES
 TO  BE MADE TO VS. MAPLPA NOW WILL MAP THE LINK PACK AREA OF SVM, THIS
 IS A CHANGE FROM MAPLPA VERSION III.

    MAPLPA  MAY  BE  INVOKED  IN  THE  STANDARD WAY, PASSING PARAMETERS
 AND/OR ALTERNATE DDNAME'S...SEE THE UTILITIES SRL.

    JCL REQUIRED TO EXECUTE MAPLPA IS STANDARD DATASET UTILITY JCL:

      //STEPNAME EXEC PGM=MAPLPA
      // <,PARM='LINES=L=NNN,ALPHA,KVTEPSBOTH'>
      // <,REGION=XXXXK>
      <//SYSPUNCH DD SYSOUT=B<,DCB=BLKSIZE=PPPPP>>
      <//PUNCH DD SYSOUT=B<,DCB=BLKSIZE=PPPPP>>
      <//STEPLIB DD DSN=D89MSC1.SIMMON.LOAD,DISP=SHR>
      //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=C,<DCB=BLKSIZE=BBBBB>
      <//PRINT DD SYSOUT=C,<DCB=BLKSIZE=BBBBB>>

      WHERE:

           NNN  (LINE  COUNT) IS ANY NUMBER FROM 10 THRU 999. THIS WILL
                BE  USED  TO  SET  THE LINE COUNT PER PAGE. THE DEFAULT
                LINE COUNT IS 56.

                NOTE:

                      IF  AN  INVALID  LINE  COUNT  IS PASSED TO MAPLPA
                           (LESS  THAN  10  OR  GREATER  THAN 999), THE
                           DEFAULT  LINE  COUNT  (56)  WILL BE USED. AN
                           ERROR MESSAGE WILL BE ISSUED; IT WILL APPEAR
                           IN THE USER'S JCL.

           ALPHA  THIS  SPECIFIES  THAT  MAPLPA  SHOULD PRODUCE PUNCHED
                OUTPUT   IN  ALPHABETICAL  ORDER  RATHER  THAN  ADDRESS
                (NUMERICAL) ORDER.

           KVT THIS SPECIFIES THAT MAPLPA SHOULD PRODUCE PUNCHED OUTPUT
                SIMILAR TO THE NUCPUNCH PROGRAM (QV); ALSO SEE APPENDIX
                I.

           EPS  THIS  SPECIFIES  THAT  MAPLPA SHOULD PRODUCE ONLY MINOR
                OUTPUT CARDS; IE, ONLY CARDS WHICH ARE FOR ALIAS MEMBER
                NAMES.

           BOTH  THIS  SPECIFIES  THAT  MAPLPA  SHOULD PRODUCE BOTH THE
                MAJOR  AND  MINOR  CARDS  AS  OUTPUT; IE, BOTH THE TRUE
                MEMBER NAMES AND ALIAS MEMBER NAMES.


1MAPLPA: A LINK PACK AREA MAPPING PROGRAM                     PAGE    3


           C  (SYSOUT  CLASS)  IS ANY ALPHA CHARACTER FROM A THRU Z, OR
                ANY NUMERIC CHARACTER FROM 0 THRU 9.

                NOTE:

                      FOR  PROPER  OUTPUT,  MAPLPA  REQUIRES  A PRINTER
                           HAVING  AT  LEAST  132 POSITIONS AND A PN OR
                           EQUIVALENT TRAIN/CHAIN.

           BBBBB (BLKSIZE FOR SYSPRINT OR PRINT) IS ANY MULTIPLE OF 137
                UP  TO  AND INCLUDING FULL-TRACK BLOCKING. THE LRECL IS
                137; THE DEFAULT IS 3509. THE RECFM IS VBA.

           PPPPP  (BLKSIZE FOR SYSPUNCH OR PUNCH) IS ANY MULTIPLE OF 80
                UP  TO  AND  INCLUDING FULL-TRACK BLOCKING. THE DEFAULT
                BLOCKSIZE IS 80.

           XXXX  (REGION SIZE) CAN BE DETERMINED, APPROXIMATELY, BY THE
                FOLLOWING FORMULA:

                XXXX = 128K + (2*BBBBB +2*PPPPP +4096) / 1024)K


     SYSPRINT  THIS  IS  THE  PRIMARY OUTPUT OF MAPLPA. IT OR THE PRINT
          DDCARD IS A REQUIRED DDCARD.

                NOTE:

                      MAPLPA  VERSIONS  I  AND  II  USED  PRINT  AS THE
                           PRIMARY   OUTPUT   DDNAME.   THIS  HAS  BEEN
                           RETAINED FOR COMPATIBILITY.

           SYSPUNCH THIS IS THE SECONDARY OUTPUT OF MAPLPA. IT IS NOT A
                REQUIRED  DDCARD.  SEE  APPENDIX  II  FOR  OUTPUT  CARD
                FORMAT.

           STEPLIB  THIS IS A LIBRARY ON THE TSO A-QUEUE WHICH CONTAINS
                THE CURRENT VERSION OF MAPLPA.

                NOTE:

                      FOR A FULLER EXPLAINATION OF THE DDCARD'S USED BY
                           MAPLPA, SEE APPENDIX III.


1MAPLPA: A LINK PACK AREA MAPPING PROGRAM                     PAGE    4


    MAPLPA'S PRIMARY OUTPUT IS TWO LISTINGS OF THE LINK PACK AREA TO BE
         MAPPED:

           1.  A  MAP  OF  THE  LOAD MODULES IN THE LINK PACK AREA, THE
                MODIFIED  LINK PACK AREA, THE FIXED LINK PACK AREA, AND
                CERTAIN   SYSTEM  AREAS  (SUCH  AS  SQA,  ETC.)  SORTED
                ALPHABETICALLY   WITH   MAJOR  NAMES  AND  MINOR  NAMES
                INDICATED (A MINOR NAME IS AN ALIAS).

           2. A MAP OF THE LINK PACK AREA, THE MODIFIED LINK PACK AREA,
                THE  FIXED  LINK  PACK  AREA,  AND CERTAIN SYSTEM AREAS
                SORTED  BY  ADDRESS.  MINOR  NAMES  AND MAJOR NAMES ARE
                INDICATED.


      IF  THE  SYSPUNCH  DDCARD  IS  PRESENT,  CARDS,  AS  DESCRIBED IN
           APPENDIX  I,  WILL  BE  PRODUCED. THE SYSPUNCH DDCARD IS NOT
           REQUIRED.

      THE  OUTPUT  IN  THE SYSPUNCH DATASET DEPENDS UPON THE PARAMETERS
           SPECIFIED  (OR NOT SPECIFIED) ON THE EXEC CARD; SEE APPENDIX
           I.

                         THE SYSPUNCH DATASET


      MAPLPA PRODUCES CARDS WITH THE FOLLOWING FORMAT:

           COLUMNS 1 THRU 6 - LOAD MODULE START ADDRESS
           COLUMN 7 - THE MAJOR NAME FLAG
           COLUMNS 10 THRU 15 - LOAD MODULE LENGTH
           COLUMNS 16 THRU 23 - LOAD MODULE OR ALIAS NAME
           COLUMN 24 - THE LENGTH FLAG

      COLUMNS  1  THRU 6 CONTAIN THE LOAD MODULE OR ALIAS START ADDRESS
           IN HEXIDECIMAL, SIX CHARACTERS WITH LEADING ZEROES.

      COLUMN 7 CONTAINS AN ASTERISK (*) INDICATING THE CARD HAS A MAJOR
           NAME  IN  COLUMNS  16 THRU 23. A MAJOR NAME IS A LOAD MODULE
           NAME. MINOR (ALIAS) NAME CARDS WILL NOT HAVE THIS ASTERISK.

      COLUMNS  10 THRU 15 CONTAIN THE LOAD MODULE LENGTH. THIS IS TAKEN
           FROM  THE  LPDE'S FOR THE LINK PACK AREA, AND FROM THE CDE'S
           FOR  LOAD  MODULES  IN  THE FIXED LINK PACK AREA. MINOR NAME
           CARDS WILL HABE BLANKS HERE.

      COLUMNS  16  THRU  23  CONTAIN  THE  LOAD MODULE OR ALIAS NAME IN
           EBCDIC, EIGHT CHARACTERS WITH TRAILING BLANKS.

      COLUMN  24  CONTAINS  AN  ASTERISK (*) INDICATING THAT COLUMNS 10
           THRU  15  CONTAIN  THE  LOAD MODULE LENGTH. MINOR NAME CARDS
           WILL NOT HAVE THIS ASTERISK.

      IF  THE KVT PARM HAS BEEN SPECIFIED IN THE PARM FIELD OF THE EXEC
           CARD, MAPLPA WILL PRODUCE CARDS WITH THE FOLLOWING FORMAT:

        FORMAT  OF  VARIABLE  BLOCKED  WITH  ASA  CONTROL CHARACTERS, A
        LOGICAL  RECORD LENGTH OF 137, AND A DEFAULT BLOCKSIZE OF 3509.
        THE  BLOCKSIZE CAN BE OVIDDEN VIA THE DDCARD. SYSPRINT CONTAINS
        ANY  ERR  ERROR  MESSAGES  THAT WERE ISSUED, AND THE TWO SORTED
        LISTINGS PRODUCED BY MAPLPA.

   PRINT  THIS  IS  AN  ALTERNATE DDNAME FOR SYSPRINT. MAPLPA VERSION I

        RETAINED FOR COMPATIBILITY.

        FORMAT  OF  FIXED BLOCKED, A LOGICAL RECORD LENGTH OF 80, AND A

        PUNCHED OUTPUT OF MAPLPA, A DD DUMMY CARD IS NOT REQUIRED.

   PUNCH  THIS  IS  AN  ALTERNATE  NAME FOR THE SYSPUNCH DDCARD. MAPLPA
        VERSION  I  USED  THIS AS THE DDNAME FOR THE PUNCHED OUTPUT; IT
