 This system has   4 CLISTS: ALLOCMIN, ALLOCMOR, ALLOCTRP and LISTAP
                     (refer to MVSUG.CLIST);
                   3 HELP members: HELPMIN, HELPMOR and HELPLST
                     (refer to MVSUG.HELP);
                   2 ASSEMBLER source members: ALLOCMN and ALLOCMR

   I) DESCRIPTION OF ALL MEMBERS

      @DOC     - contains three major headings:
                 I) description of all members
                II) how to install the functions
               III) how to use

      ALLOCMIN - The clist whose function is to allow you to remove an S
                 library from an existing concatenation, requiring only
                 you know the ddname from which the library is to be rem
                 This clist invokes clist ALLOCTRP to trap the allocated
                 dataset names and the catalog entry for the requested l
                 The catalog entry is used to determine if an alias name
                 specified, so that the actual (associated) name may be
                 searched for.  In addition, this clist then executes pr
                 ALLOCMN, which reads the data trapped in ALLOCTRP and p
                 dataset names back to ALLOCMIN.

      ALLOCMOR - The clist whose function is to allow you to add an SPF
                 library to an existing concatenation, requiring only th
                 you know the ddname to which the library is to be added
                 This clist invokes clist ALLOCTRP to trap the allocated
                 dataset names.  This clist then executes program ALLOCM
                 which reads the data trapped in ALLOCTRP and passes dat
                 names back to ALLOCMIN.

      ALLOCTRP - The clist which is invoked by both ALLOCMIN and ALLOCMO
                 and whose function is to trap the output from the TSO L
                 and LISTC commands.  The trapped output is put to a tem
                 dataset named 'userid.@TRAP.ddname'.  When MVS 2.2.0 is
                 installed, it is planned that the major function of thi
                 clist will be replaced by the RDJFCB macro which will,
                 told, be able to access concatenated datasets.

      LISTAP   - A clist which will list those datasets that are allocat
                 to an active TSO session for one specific DDNAME.  It w
                 developed during testing of ALLOCMIN and ALLOCMOR, but
                 be handy at other times, when the full LISTA command O/
                 cumbersome to read through.

      HELPMIN  - The HELP dataset member for command ALLOCMIN

      HELPMOR  - The HELP dataset member for command ALLOCMOR

      HELPLST  - The HELP dataset member for command LISTAP

      ALLOCMN  - an assembler program which works in conjunction with tw
                 clists: ALLOCMIN and ALLOCTRP.  ALLOCTRP issues the TSO
                 "LISTA" and "LISTC" commands and traps the output in a
                 dataset which is read by this program.  The IKJCT441 ro
                 creates/updates clist variables which are the variable
                 of dataset names allocated to the ddname specified in t
                 parm.  Clist ALLOCMOR then re-allocates the requested d
                 with all previously allocated dataset names minus the o
                 dsname specified.  When MVS 2.2.0 is installed, the RDJ
                 macro will be able to access dsnames for concatenated
                 datasets, and clist ALLOCTRP will be reduced in functio

      ALLOCMR  - an assembler program which works in conjunction with tw
                 clists: ALLOCMOR and ALLOCTRP.  ALLOCTRP issues the TSO
                 "LISTA" and "LISTC" commands and traps the output in a
                 which is read by this program.  The LISTC output is use
                 in program ALLOCMN, and is ignored here.  Allocated dat
                 names are tabled, up to a max of 20 table entries.  The
                 IKJCT441 routine creates/updates clist variables which
                 variable number of dataset names allocated to the ddnam
                 specified in the parm.  Clist ALLOCMOR then re-allocate
                 requested ddname with all previously allocated dataset
                 and the additional dsname concatenated.  When MVS 2.2.0
                 installed, the RDJFCB macro will be able to access dsna
                 concatenated datasets, and clist ALLOCTRP can be substa
                 reduced in function.


  II) HOW TO INSTALL  (easy as 1-2-3)
      1) Assemble and link both ALLOCMN and ALLOCMR into a linklst libra
         a library which is STEPLIB'd to during the TSO session.  If you
         into a linklst library, remember to do a linklst refresh.  The
         modules ar neither reentrant nor authorized.
      2) Copy HELPMIN, HELPMOR, and HELPLST to a HELP dataset such as
         SYS1.HELP, which is allocated to the TSO session, and rename th
         respectively: ALLOCMIN, ALLOCMOR, LISTAP.
      3) Copy the 4 clists to a SYSPROC concatenated library.  These cli
         can be copied to a clist library with LRECL=80, RECFM=FB or to
         library with LRECL=255, RECFM=VB.



 III) HOW TO USE

      A) EXAMPLES:

         1) %ALLOCMOR SYSPROC Z.CLIST LAST
            This will add dataset 'userid.Z.CLIST' at the end of the
            concatenated CLIST libraries.

         2) %ALLOCMOR ISPPLIB 'TEST.SOME.PANELS' FIRST
            %ALLOCMOR ISPPLIB 'TEST.MY.PANELS' F
            This will add two panel libraries to the beginning of the IS
            concatenation,  'TEST.MY.PANELS' will be concatenated in fro
            'TEST.SOME.PANELS'.

         3) %ALLOCMIN ISPPLIB 'TEST.MY.PANELS'
            This will remove 'TEST.MY.PANELS' from the list of datasets
            concatenated to ISPPLIB.

      B) NOTES:
         1) Be sure NOT to FREE the DDNAME before using it in %ALLOCMOR.
         2) The standard rules regarding dataset concatenation still app
            The dataset with the largest blocksize must be first in the
            concatenation.
         3) Both ALLOCMIN and ALLOCMOR must execute in TSO foreground, w
            ISPF not active.
