The GENERICS program returns the protecting RACF dataset profile for any
dataset/VOLSER combination input to it. This is done by way of a RACHECK
performed on the input dataset, with the returned profile information
trapped, formatted, and output to a sequential dataset.

Input to the GENERICS program is formatted as follows:

               Columns 13-18: VOLSER containing dataset
               Columns 19-63: dataset name

Output from the GENERICS program is formatted as follows:

               Columns   1-6: VOLSER containing dataset
               Columns  7-50: dataset name
               Columns 51-94: protecting profile name

The unusual input format of GENERICS allows for input to the program to
come directly from the raw data file produced by the DMS/OS SVD
reporting program.

GENERICS is most useful in shops that make a great deal of use out of
RACF generic dataset profiles, as these may apply to more than one
dataset.

GENERICS must be linkedited APF authorized and run from an APF
authorized library.
