The RACFGRP1 program extracts group and subgroup data from RACF group
profiles, and formats the extracted data into an output file suitable
for input to user developed programs.

Output from the RACFGRP1 program is formatted as follows:

           Columns   1-8: Group name
           Columns  9-16: Superior group
           Columns 17-24: Owner
           Column     25: UACC
           Column     26: NOTERMUACC
           Columns 27-28: Number of subgroups
           Columns 29-36: Subgroup name

Output from the RACFGRP1 program will be a listing of the group profile
data extracted sorted alphabetically by group profile name.

RACFGRP1 is most useful in combination with other RACF reporting
programs found on this tape; for example, combining RACFGRP1 output with
that of RACFDSET, it is possible to construct a report of RACF dataset
authorizations made at the group level.

RACFGRP1 must be linkedited APF authorized and run from an APF
authorized library.
