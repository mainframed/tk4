   THIS MODULE IS INTENDED TO BE USED AS AN EXIT TO AMDPRDMP,
   AND WILL OPERATE AS A VERB EXIT.  THE SELECTED VERB WILL
   CAUSE THIS EXIT TO GET CONTROL, ONCE AN ENTRY IS ADDED
   TO AMDPRECT.  THIS ROUTINE USES STANDARD PRINTDUMP LINKAGE
   TO FORMAT AND PRINT CONTROL BLOCKS, PRINT MESSAGES, AND
   TO ACCESS DUMPED DATA.  IT IS INTENDED TO BE USED TO
   AID THE PSR IN DETERMINING A PROBLEM, WHEN EITHER CSA OR
   SQA IS DEPLETED.  THE PROGRAM DOES NOT USE A GETMAINED
   AREA FOR ITS' WORKAREA, SO IT IS NOT RE-ENTRANT, BUT THIS
   SHOULD NOT PRESENT A PROBLEM, IF IT IS NOT PLACED IN LPA.
   THE EXIT CHANGES SOME DATA IN THE WORKAREA, AFTER MOVING
   THE DATA FROM PRINTDUMPS' BUFFER, FOR EASE OF FORMATTING.
   (RATHER THAN FORMATTING FQE'S, THE ROUTINE COLLECTS DATA FROM
   THE FQE, AND PRINTS INFORMATION CONCERNING ALLOCATED CORE.
   THIS IS THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS VERSION OF THE PRO-
   GRAM, AND THE EARLIER VERSION. )
   WORKAREA LABELS MAY HAVE TO BE CHANGED, IF THE FOLLOWING MSS
   CONTROL BLOCKS ARE CHANGED:

                CVT, GDA, PQE, FBQE, SPQE, DQE, OR FQE.

   THIS ROUTINE IS NOT FORMALLY SUPPORTED IN ANY WAY, BUT
   I WOULD BE HAPPY TO ATTEMPT ANY CORRECTIONS, ON AN 'AS
   AVAILABLE' BASIS.
