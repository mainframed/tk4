       PDSEDIT IS  AN EDITOR DESIGNED  TO OPERATE  IN A BATCH  ENVIRONME
       PARTITIONED DATA SETS.  INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS MAY BE SELECTED OR EXC
       FROM THE EDIT PROCESS.   THE EDITED MEMBERS MAY REPLACE THEIR ORI
       VERSIONS OR BE  WRITTEN INTO A DIFFERENT PARTITIONED  DATA SET.
       EDIT FUNCTIONS ARE PROVIDED:
0         - FIND ALL OCCURRENCES  OF A SPECIFIED STRING.   THE  SEARCH M
            LIMITED TO SPECIFIED COLUMNS.
0         - CHANGE ALL OCCURRENCES OF A SPECIFIED STRING.   THE SEARCH M
            LIMITED TO SPECIFIED COLUMNS.
0         - INSERT LINES  BEFORE OR  AFTER EACH  LINE CONTAINING  A SPEC
            STRING (USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH A FIND OR CHANGE)
0         - DELETE  LINES INCLUDING  AND  FOLLOWING  EACH LINE  CONTAINI
            SPECIFIED STRING (USED IN CONJUNCTION WITH A FIND OR CHANGE)
0      IF EDITED  MEMBERS ARE TO  BE WRITTEN BACK  INTO THE ORIGINAL  PD
       MEMBER WHICH HAS  BEEN CHANGED BUT HAS HAD NO  INSERTIONS OR DELE
       WILL BE UPDATED IN PLACE.   IF EDITED MEMBERS ARE TO BE WRITTEN I
       DIFFERENT PDS,  THEY WILL REPLACE LIKE-NAMED MEMBERS.   A MEMBER
       HAS NOT BEEN CHANGED WILL NOT BE WRITTEN OUT.  THUS, IF EDITED ME
       ARE TO BE WRITTEN INTO A DIFFERENT  PDS,  THIS OUTPUT PDS WILL CO
       ONLY THOSE MEMBERS WHICH WERE CHANGED.
