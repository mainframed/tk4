The RACFGRES program extracts data from RACF general resource profiles,
and formats the extracted data into an output file suitable for input to
user developed programs.

Input to the RACFGRES program consists of a single passed parameter,
which is the general resource class on which reporting is requested.

Output from the RACFGRES program is formatted as follows:

           Columns   1-8: Resource name
           Columns  9-16: Resource class
           Columns 17-24: owner
           Column     25: UACC
           Column  26-33: Authorized user
           Column     34: Authorized user's access authority

Output from the RACFGRES program will be a listing of the general
resource profile data extracted sorted alphabetically by general
resource profile name.

RACFGRES is most useful in combination with other RACF reporting
programs found on this tape; for example, combining RACFGRES output
with that of RACFUSER, it is possible to construct a report of RACF
general resource authorizations sorted by user-ID, or even user name.

RACFGRES must be linkedited APF authorized and run from an APF
authorized library.
