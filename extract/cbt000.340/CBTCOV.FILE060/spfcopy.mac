*         SPFCOPY - SPF COMPRESS REPLACEMENT FOR IEBCOPY.             *
*                                                                     *
*         THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS UNAUTHORIZED TASKS            *
*         (SUCH AS SPF) TO RUN IEBCOPY BY INVOKING THIS               *
*         PROGRAM INSTEAD OF IEBCOPY.                                 *
*                                                                     *
*         THIS PROGRAM MUST RESIDE IN THE LPA TO WORK PROPERLY.       *
*         IT ISSUES A USER SVC (239) WHICH WILL NOT WORK UNLESS       *
*         IT IS ISSUED FROM THE LPA.                                  *
*                                                                     *
*         THIS CODE IS COPIED FROM THE SPF INSTALLATION GUIDE         *
*         (IBM PUBLICATION SH20-2402-0).  THERE IS A MINOR CHANGE     *
*         TO THE USER SVC - OURS IS 239, NOT 235, AND OURS USES       *
*         REGISTER 1 AS A SWITCH INSTEAD OF REGISTER 0, AND OURS      *
*         USES REGISTER 0 AS A CONSTANT VALUE 0.                      *
*                                                                     *
*         THE PURPOSE OF THIS PROGRAM IS TO ALLOW SPF, WHICH IS       *
*         AN UNAUTHORIZED PROGRAM, TO INVOKE 'IEBCOPY', WHICH IS      *
*         AUTHORIZED, YET STILL MAINTAIN SYSTEM INTEGRITY.            *
*                                                                     *
*         DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THIS CODE AND THAT IN THE GUIDE WERE    *
*         WRITTEN BY BILL GODFREY, PRC COMPUTER CENTER INC,           *
*         MCLEAN VA, MARCH 1980.                                      *
*         THE ESTAE EXIT WAS EXTENSIVELY CHANGED. THE ESTAE EXIT      *
*         IN THE GUIDE APPEARED TO HAVE SOME ERRORS.                  *
*                                                                     *
*         THE PROGRAM SETS THE AUTHORIZATION CODE ON, INVOKES         *
*         IEBCOPY, THEN SETS THE AUTHORIZATION CODE OFF.              *
*                                                                     *
*         UNEXPECTED INTERRUPTIONS WHILE THE AUTHORIZATION CODE       *
*         IS ON ARE TRAPPED BY THE ESTAE EXIT SO THE AUTHORIZATION    *
*         CAN BE SET BACK OFF. ATTENTION INTERRUPTS ARE DEFERRED.     *
*                                                                     *
*         IF THIS PROGRAM ABENDS WITH AN 047, THE USER SVC WAS        *
*         INSTALLED AS THE TYPE OF SVC THAT REQUIRES AUTHORIZATION.   *
*         USE ANOTHER SVC NUMBER - ONE THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE AUTH.    *
*                                                                     *
*         IF THIS PROGRAM ABENDS WITH A B0A, THE USER SVC THINKS      *
*         SPFCOPY IS NOT IN LPA, AND IEBCOPY HAS ABENDED.             *
*                                                                     *
