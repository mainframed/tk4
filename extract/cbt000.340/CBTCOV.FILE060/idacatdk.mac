*
*   IDACATDK:
*
*   THIS PROGRAM IS A STRIPPED DOWN AND MODIFIED VERSION OF IDACATFX.
*   IT HAS TWO FUNCTIONS. THE MAP FUNCTION IS FROM IDACATFX. THE
*   INDEX FUNCTION WILL DECOMPRESS THE ENTIRE INDEX LEVEL KEYS.
*
*   INSTALLATION:
*
* PROGRAM MUST BE IN AUTHORIZED LIB TO WORK AND LINKEDITED WITH
*    AC(1) IN ORDER TO OPEN A VSAM CATALOG AS A VSAM DATA SET.
*
*     EXECUTION:
*
* ONCE THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN LINKED, USE THE FOLLOWING TO INVOKE IT:
*      //IDACATDK EXEC  PGM=IDACATDK,PARM='CATALOG PASSWORD'
*      //SYSPRINT DD    SYSOUT=A
*      //STEPCAT  DD    DSN=CATALOG NAME,DISP=SHR  (IF USER CATALOG)
*      //VSAMCAT  DD    DSN=CATALOG NAME,DISP=SHR
*      //SYSIN    DD         (OPTIONAL)
*       COMMANDS AND OPERANDS
*      /*
*
*  THE COMMANDS AND OPERANDS MAY BE PROVIDED BY EITHER THE SYSIN
*  DATA SET, OR IF THE SYSIN DD IS MISSING, BY PROMPT TO THE OPERATOR
*  CONSOLE. THE INPUT IS FREE FORM. THAT IS, THE COMMANDS MAY BE
*  ANYWHERE IN THE INPUT STATEMENT OR MAY SPAN CARDS.
*  YOU MAY HAVE MORE THAT ONE COMMAND ON A CARD.  THE COMMANDS
*  OPERANDS MUST FOLLOW THE VERB.
*  IF THE COMMANDS ARE TO BE ENTERED VIA THE OPERATORS CONSOLE, EACH
*  COMMAND AND OPERAND WILL BE PROMPTED FOR IF NOT PROVIDED IN THE
*  INITIAL INPUT.
*
*  COMMANDS:
*
*    DISPLAY   THIS COMMAND WILL DISPLAY REQUESTED CATALOG RECORDS
*              TO THE OPERATORS CONSOLE.
*
*    PRINT     THIS COMMAND HAS THE SAME FORMAT AS THE DISPLAY
*              COMMAND. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO COMMANDS
*              IS THAT OUTPUT FROM THE PRINT COMMAND WILL BE
*              WRITTEN TO THE SYSTEM OUTPUT PRINTER WHERE OUTPUT
*              FROM DISPLAY WILL BE WRITTEN TO THE OPERATORS
*              CONSOLE.
*
*         DISPLAY INDEX
*
*         PRINT   INDEX
*
*            INDEX     THE ENTIRE INDEX PORTION OF THE CATALOG WILL BE
*                      DISPLAYED ON THE CONSOLE. IDACATDK WILL
*                      DECOMPRESS THE KEYS OF THE ENTIRE INDEX.
*                      IF THE CATALOG IS LARGE YOU SHOULD USE
*                      PRINT COMMAND TO OBTAIN A COPY OF THE INDEX
*                      RATHER THAN DISPLAY.
*
*    MAP        MAP GIVES STATISTICS ABOUT THE CATALOG.  OF IMPORTANCE
*               IS THE 'COUNT OF USED BUT EMPTY CI'S'.  THIS COUNT
*               TELLS YOU WHEN THE CATALOG IS BECOMING FULL OF
*               CI'S THAT WERE ONCE USED BUT NOW EMPTY AND HENCE MAY
*               NOT BE USED AGAIN.  IF THIS COUNT BECOMES HIGH AND
*               DOES NOT REDUCE DURING NORMAL CATALOG ACTIVITY, YOU
*               MAY WANT TO REPRO THE CATALOG TO RECLAIM THE EMPTY
*               CI'S.
*               ALSO, THE 'COUNT OF NEVER USED CI'S' IS THE COUNT
*               OF TRUE FREE SPACE.  IT IS THESE CI'S THAT CI SPLITS
*               WILL OCCUR IN (THEY ARE TRULY FREE).
*
*    CRA        THIS COMMAND WILL CHANGE PROCESSING FROM THE CATALOG
*               TO THE CRA IF:
*               1. THERE IS A CRA FOR THE CATALOG
*               2. THERE IS A DDNAME OF "VSAMCRA" IN THE JOBSTREAM.
*                  THIS DD NAME MUST CONTAIN THE VOLSER OF THE DISK
*                  THAT THE CRA IS ON THAT CATFIX IS TO PROCESS.  SOME
*                  CATFIX COMMANDS, SUCH AS FCHAIN, ARE NOT VALID IN
*                  THIS MODE.  AN ERROR MESSAGE WILL BE ISSUED IF YOU
*                  ATTEMP TO ISSUE SUCH A COMMAND.  YOU MUST USE
*                  "RBA=" PROCESS AS THE CRA IS AN ESDS AND DOES NOT
*                  HAVE KEYS FOR "CI=" OR "DSN=" OPERANDS.
