*  PURPOSE:  THIS PROGRAM WILL BUILT AN EXCLUDE LIST CONSISTING OF   *
*            SYSMODS TO BE EXCLUDED FOR A GIVEN FMID.  THE OUTPUT OF *
*            THIS PROGRAM CAN BE PASSED TO IBM'S PUTCNTL PROGRAM     *
*            THROUGH THE DLLEXCL DD.  THIS PROGRAM CAN ALSO BE USED  *
*            TO FIND ALL THE MAINTENANCE FOR A FMID, THEN AN APPLY   *
*            SELECT CAN BE USED.  THIS PICKS UP SOME MAINTENANCE NOT *
*            CAUGHT BY AN APPLY GROUP.                               *
*                                                                    *
*  INPUT:    THE INPUT CONSISTS OF A SYSIN DATASET CONTAINING FMIDS  *
*            FOR WHICH SYSMODS ARE TO BE EXCLUDED.  IF NO INPUT IS   *
*            GIVEN, THEN ALL THE INPUT CONSISTS OF ALL THE FMIDS THAT*
*            THE PTS SYSTEM ENTRY CONTAINS.                          *
*                                                                    *
*  OUTPUT:   THE OUTPUT WILL CONSIST OF A SYSPRINT DATASET CONTAINING*
*            THE EXCLUDED SYSMODS LISTED FOR EACH FMID.              *
*            IF THE USER POINTS TO A CARD IMAGE DATASETS, THE SORTED *
*            (BY SYSMOD ID) EXCLUDE LIST WILL BE PRODUCED.           *
*                                                                    *

*                FOR INITDATE.  THIS PDS ALSO CONTAINS ALL THE       *
*                PRIVATE MACROS NEEDED FOR PTSSRCH AND ADDRALL .     *
*                ASSEMBLE PTSSRCH AND ADDRALL USING THE PDS WITH     *
*                THE PRIVATE MACROS AS ONE OF YOUR SYSLIBS, THEN LINK*
*                THE OBJECT DECKS FOR PTSSRCH, ADDRALL, AND INITDATE *
