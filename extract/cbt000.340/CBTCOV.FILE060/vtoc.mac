    THIS IS THE VTOC COMMAND.  IT ALLOWS YOU TO SEARCH
    THE VOLUME TABLE OF CONTENTS OF ONE OR MORE DISK
    VOLUMES AND OBTAIN LISTINGS OR TOTALS OF DATA SETS
    MEETING SOME CRITERIA.  THE SPECIFICATION IS QUITE
    FLEXIBLE.  SEE THE HELP LISTING BELOW FOR MORE
    INFORMATION AND SOME EXAMPLES.
    SOME OF THE MACROS MAY BE OF INTEREST TOO.  THE
    ALLOC AND FREE MACROS HAVE MOST OF THE PARMS OF A DD
    CARD, USING THE SVC 99 INTERFACE.

    THIS COMMAND WAS BROUGHT TO YOU BY THE INSURANCE
    COMPANY WITH THE FIRE HAT.  IF YOU HAVE COMMENTS
    PLEASE MAKE THEM TO

KNOWN GLITCHES
   1. THE OUTPUT FUNCTION DOESN'T.  IT WAS TO BE A COMPRESSED
      FORM OF MACHINE READABLE OUTPUT.  THE STANDARD VTOCOUT
      OPTION SEEMS TO FUNCTION FAIRLY WELL, SO THIS WILL
      BE REMOVED.
   2. THE CCHH CANNOT BE PRINTED, AND LOTS OF GARBAGE IS
      PRINTED IF A USER REQUESTS IT.  THE CODE FOR PRINTING
      CCHH IS NOT IN YET, AND THERE IS A CONFLICT IN TABTITL
      BETWEEN DSNAME AND CCHH FUNCTIONS.  THE ROUTINE NUMBER
      OF CCHH WILL BE CHANGED TO 40 TO AVOID THE CONFLICT.
      THIS WILL CAUSE CHANGES IN VTOCFORM AND VTOCPRNT.
   3. THE CATALOG CHECK IS NOT FUNCTIONAL.  THE CODE TO
      CHANGE LOCAT IF THE CAT KEYWORD IS FOUND IN THE LIST
      OF PRINT, LIM, AND, OR OR SUBPARAMETERS IS NOT
      IN THIS COMMAND.

FIREMAN'S FUND DEFAULTS ( PROBABLY NEED TO BE CHANGED FOR YOU )
      SOME OF THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE AT FIREMAN'S FUND
      HAS AFFECTED THE CHOICE OF OPTIONS WITHIN THIS COMMAND.
      ALL FIREMAN'S FUND DISKS ARE 3350'S, BUT AN MSS IS
      ANTICIPATED.  ALMOST ALL OF THE TSO TERMINALS ARE
      BRAND X 3270'S.  THE TEST PRINTERS ARE 3800'S SET
      AT 15 PITCH, 8 LINES PER INCH 8 1/2 BY 11 PAPER.
      YOU WILL NOTICE THE BIASES IN SEVERAL DISCUSSIONS
      AND IN THE DEFAULTS IN THE COMMAND.
   1. LAST USE DATE - AT DECIMAL 75, X'4B' IN THE DSCB
      IN PACKED DECIMAL FORMAT.  REFERENCES TO VTFLSTAC
      IN VTOCFORM, VTOCCHEK, AND VTOCCHEK PROBABLY NEED
      TO BE CHANGED.
   2. VTOCOUT PRINT LRECL=150 BY DEFAULT.  THIS IS GREAT FOR
      3800 PRINTERS AT 15 PITCH ON 8 1/2 BY 11 PAPER, BUT YOU
      MAY NOT BE RUNNING THIS WAY.  CHANGE THE CONSTANT DEFLEN
      IN THE VTOCPRNT CSECT.
   3. KILOBYTES ARE THE DEFAULT SIZE MEASURE.  THIS IS NICE FOR
      MULTIPLE DEVICE TYPES.  IF YOU WANT TRACKS OR CYLINDERS
      TO BE THE DEFAULT, YOU'LL HAVE TO CHANGE THE MACRO
      VTOCPARS, THE TABSPACE TABLE IN VTOCPRNT, AND THE
      BRANCH TABLE IN VTOCFORM.
      UNLESS ALL THE DATA SETS ARE ALLOCATED ON CYLINDER
      BOUNDARIES, THE CYL OPTION WILL TRUNCATE AND GIVE
      INCORRECT TOTALS.
   4. DEFAULT PRINT LIST.  LABEL DEFPRNT IN VTOCPRNT DEFINES
      THE LIST.  OF COURSE, THE PRINT KEYWORD CAN CHANGE
      IT, BUT YOU MAY WANT OTHER INFORMATION TO BE STANDARD.
      THE CURRENT DEFAULTS ARE PROBABLY BETTER CHECKED THAN
      THE OTHER PARMS.

WISH LIST
      WHEN I GET AROUND TO IT ( PROBABLY MUCH LATER ), THERE
      ARE A LOT OF GENERALIZATIONS THAT WOULD BE VERY NICE.

   1. MORE GENERALIZED TOTAL AND SUBTOTAL LOGIC.  THE TOTAL
      KEYWORD HAS A SUBPARAMETER OF THE NUMBER OF CHARACTERS
      OF THE PRIMARY SORT FIELD.  THIS SHOULD BE USED LIKE
      THE BREAK COUNT TO DEFINE SUBTOTALS.  ALSO, A NOTOTAL
      OPTION SHOULD BE PUT IN.  THE TOTALS AND SUBTOTALS
      SHOULD FUNCTION FOR ALL THE FIELDS, PRINTING BENEATH
      THE HEADER.
   2. IMPROVED SORTING CAPABILITY.  IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE
      TO SORT ON ANY FIELD IN DESCENDING OR ASCENDING
      ORDER.  THE VTOCSORT ROUTINE IS MINIMAL NOW.
      OF COURSE, EXTERNAL SORTING IS FAIRLY EASY, AS IN
      THE SAS PROGRAM BELOW.
   3. SUPPORT FOR AN EXIT AND FOR EXECUTION OF COMMANDS
      SHOULD BE PROVIDED.  THIS WILL PERMIT DELETING,
      RELEASING SPACE, COMPRESSING PDS'S, ISSUING ARCHIVE
      COMMANDS, AND ANYTHING ELSE I CAN THINK OF.
   4. SIGNIFICANT GENERALIZATION IN THE DATA TO BE FORMATTED
      IS ANOTHER POSSIBILITY.  THIS RANGES FROM CALCULATING
      SPACE IN BLOCKS FOR DATA SETS, ALLOWING ABSOLUTE
      TRACK NOTATION AS WELL AS CCHH, ALLOWING * TO REPRESENT
      TODAY'S DATE ( *-N FOR N DAYS AGO ), EXPANDED DATE
      FORMATS, AND ADDITIONAL DSCB FIELDS TO SIGNIFICANT
      EXTENSIONS SUCH AS FORMATTING DSCB'S OTHER THAN
      FORMAT 1'S AND ALLOWING THE EXTENT, RATHER THAN THE
      DATA SET, TO BE THE UNIT LISTED.
      INDICATING RACF PASSWORD PROTECTION, KEYLENGTH, OPTCD,
      FMT 1 DSCB LOCATION, AND FORMAT 3 POINTERS ARE SOME
      EXAMPLES.  FORMATTING OF THE FORMAT 4 AND 5 DSCB'S
      IS ANOTHER.  THE FORMAT KEYWORD IS DESIGNED FOR THE
      LATTER.  THE FORMAT 4 AND 5 WOULD BE LISTED WHENEVER
      THEY WERE SPECIFIED.  THE FORMAT 1, 2, AND 3 WOULD ONLY
      BE LISTED IF THE DATA SET THEY REPRESENT PASSES THE
      CHECKING.
   5. EXPANDED OPTIONS FOR EXAMINING THE DATA ONLINE WOULD
      BE NICE.  A GENERAL ABILITY TO RETAIN THE INFORMATION,
      BE ABLE TO LIST THE INFORMATION OR PROVIDE NEW LIMITS
      WITHOUT REREADING THE VTOC'S AGAIN IS HELPFUL MANY TIMES.
   6. RATHER THAN ALWAYS SEARCHING VTOC'S, IT WOULD BE HELPFUL
      TO USE A CATALOG LISTING, UNITNAME, UNIT ADDRESS, OR MSVGP
      TO DEFINE THE DATA SETS TO BE LISTED.  SEVERAL LISTS OF
      DATA SET NAMES AND VOLUME SERIAL NUMBERS AS INPUT WOULD
      HELP TO ASSURE THAT ALL AUTHORIZED LIBRARIES ARE PROTECTED,
      FOR INSTANCE.
   7. SOME INFORMATION ABOUT PDS DIRECTORIES WOULD ALSO BE
      USEFUL.
   8. BETTER COMMAND INPUT VALIDATION AND ERROR HANDLING IS
      NEEDED IN MANY PLACES.
