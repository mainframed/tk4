  DYNAMIC BLDL IS A SET OF PROGRAMS OBTAINED FROM THE CONNECTICUT
BANK MODS TAPE AND MODIFIED BY HOWARD M. DEAN AT GTE DATA SERVICES.
THEY PROVIDE A WAY OF MAINTAINING AN IN CORE LIST OF DIRECTORY
ENTRIES FOR LINKLIST LIBRARYS. THIS HAS THE EFFECT OF REDUCING I/O
TO THESE LIBRARYS. IN OUR INSTALLATION, WE ARE EXPERIENCING A HIT
RATIO IN EXCESS OF 90 PERCENT. THE PROGRAM IS SET UP FOR A TABLE OF
200 ENTRIES BUT CAN BE MODIFIED FOR ANY NUMBER.

  THE COMPLETE BLDL MODIFICATION IS COMPOSED OF FOUR PROGRAMS:

  IGC018XX - BLDL SVC HOOK THAT IS COPIED TO FIXED SQA
  BLDLINIT - RUN AT IPL TIME FROM COMMND00 TO INITIALIZE DYNAMIC BLDL.
  BLDLST   - LIST INCORE DYNAMIC BLDL TABLE.
  BLDLSW   - START OR STOP DYNAMIC BLDL WITHOUT AN IPL.

*** THE SOURCE FOR THESE PROGRAMS WILL BE FOUND IN
    'HMD.MVSUG.SOURCE'  WHERE THE PROGRAM NAME IS THE MEMBER NAME.
     EACH WILL BE EXPLAINED IN ITS OWN SECTION BELOW.

   **********   IGC018XX   ***********

  PROGRAM IGC018XX IS LOADED AND MOVED INTO FIXED SQA STORAGE
(SUBPOOL 245) VIA THE BLDLINIT PROGRAM. IT'S ENTRY ADDRESS IS PLACED
IN THE SVC TABLE DYNAMICALLY AND THUS IT RECEIVES CONTROL AS A FRONT
END TO THE IBM BLDL SVC IGC018.
  PLACE A PROCEDURE CALLING THE BLDLINIT PROGRAM INTO SYS1.PROCLIB
AND INVOKE VIA THE COMMND00 MEMBER OF SYS1.PARMLIB. THIS WILL
DYNAMICALLY INSTALL THE IGC018 FRONT-END.
  TO INSTALL IGC018 IN SYS1.LINKLIB, WE USED SMP AND DID A JCLIN TO
ADD IGC018XX TO THE CDS. A SIMPLE ZAP TO MARK IGC018 FOR SMP
REGRESSION CHECKS IS USED ALSO. THIS WILL ALLOW THE SYSTEMS
PROGRAMMER TO RETROFIT IGC018XX WHEN IGC018 CHANGES. SEE THE
COMMENTS IN IGC018XX FOR A LIST OF THINGS THAT MUST BE CHANGED IF
IGC018 CHANGES.
  IGC018XX IS FIXED IN SQA STORAGE AT IPL TIME BUT CAN BE STOPPED
AND STARTED WITHOUT THE NEED OF AN IPL AT ANY TIME. SIMPLY USE THE
BLDLSW PROGRAM TO ACCOMPLISH THIS.

     **********  BLDLINIT  **********
  BLDLINIT DYNAMICALLY INITIALIZES DYNAMIC BLDL BY LOADING IGC018XX
AND DYNAMICALLY RELOCATING THE MODULE IN FIXED SQA STORAGE. THE
PROPER LOCKS ARE OBTAINED AND IGC018XX IS LOADED AND RELOCATED IN
FIXED SQA STORAGE.  THE PROCEDURE INVOKING THIS PROGRAM IS
NORMALLY PLACED IN SYS1.PROCLIB AND INVOKED VIA THE COMMND00 MEMBER
OF SYS1.PARMLIB AT IPL TIME. USING THIS APPROACH INSURES THAT
AN IPL WILL NEVER FAIL DUE TO DYNAMIC BLDL.

     **********   BLDLSW   **********
  BLDLSW IS A PROGRAM TO TURN DYNAMIC BLDL ON OR OFF WITHOUT THE
NEED FOR AN IPL.  ALL COMMUNICATION TO THE PROGRAM IS VIA THE PARM
FIELD AND ALL COMMUNICATION FROM THE PROGRAM IS VIA WTO SO NO DD
CARDS ARE NEEDED TO RUN THE PROGRAM.
  A PARM FIELD OF 'P' STOPS DYNAMIC BLDL AND A PARM FIELD OF 'S'
STARTS IT AGAIN.
  WE HAVE LINKED THIS PROGRAM INTO LINKLIB AND SINCE IT USES THE
MODESET MACRO, IT MUST BE LINKED WITH AC(1).
  CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN TO CHECK THIS PROGRAM IF IGC018XX IS
MODIFIED.  A DSECT NAMED RLDSECT IS USED TO ADDRESS CERTAIN AREAS IN
IGC018XX.  IF THE FORMAT OF THE ADDRESS CONSTANTS IN IGC018XX
CHANGES, THEN THIS DSECT SHOULD BE CHANGED ACCORDINGLY. SEE THE
COMMENTS IN BLDLSW FOR FURTHER DETAILS.

      **********   BLDLST   **********
  PROGRAM BLDLLIST COPIES THE DYNAMIC BLDL TABLE AND THEN PRODUCES A
PRINTED REPORT OF USAGE TO FILE SYSPRINT. THE SYSPRINT FILE HAS A
DCB OF RECFM=FA,LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=80 MAKING IT IDEAL FOR RUNNING
UNDER TSO TO MONITOR DYNAMIC BLDL.

   SAMPLE EXECUTION JCL:
      //LISTDYN EXEC PGM=BLDLST
      //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=A
      /*

  CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN TO EXAMINE THIS PROGRAM IF IGC018XX IS
MODIFIED AS THIS CODE DEPENDS ON CERTAIN OFFSETS IN IGC018XX.  IT
ALSO DEPENDS ON A DSECT CALLED RLDSECT. THIS DSECT CORRESPONDS TO
CERTAIN ADDRESS CONSTANTS IN IGC018XX. PLEASE UPDATE THIS DSECT IF
YOU CHANGE THE ORDER OF ADDRESS CONSTANTS IN IGC018XX.
  THE CONSTANTS THAT MAY REQUIRE CHANGE IS PREFIXED WITH THE
NATIONAL CHARACTER '$'.
