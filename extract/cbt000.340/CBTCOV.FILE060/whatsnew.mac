                CODE CHANGED TO USE PUTLINE INSTEAD OF TPUT SO YOU
                CAN ALSO RUN IT AS A BATCH TSO JOB AND GET A LIST.
                USEFUL IF YOU HAVE 200+ VOLUMES AND YOU WANT SOME
                IDEA OF WHATS ON THEM.

       WHERUSD  CROSS REFERENCE OF ALL OCCURRENCES OF A GIVEN CSECT
                IN AN ENTIRE LOAD LIBRARY. COMMON MODULES SUCH AS

                THAT BORING OLD FASHIONED PIECE OF JUNK THESE DAYS?)
                ARE EXCLUDED.

       XACORZAP XA VERSION OF INCORZAP. YOU MUST ASSEMBLE THIS PROGRAM
                USING XA MACLIBS BUT IT STILL WILL WORK WITH MVS/370.
                (I HAD ABEND S201/S240 ABENDS USING ASSEMBLER H
                -IEV90 BUT IT WORKED FINE WHEN USING THE OLD ASSEMBLER
                IEUASM/IFX??? IF YOU GET THE SAME PROBLEM TRY THIS TOO).

========================================================================

WHATS NEW THIS MONTH :  (SEP 85)

      A WHOLE SET OF APPLICATIONS TO RUN UNDER ISPF -- SEE
      SOURCE DATASET -- USER-ID S6751MH PGM NAMES ALL START WITH INV
      MESSAGES ARE ALSO IN THE PANEL DATASET AS WE DONT HAVE A SEPARATE
      MESSAGE DATASET. MESSAGES ARE INV01 INV02 MEMBERS.
      YOU WILL HAVE TO COPY THE MESSAGES TO YOUR LOGON MESSAGE DATASET.
      MOST OF THESE APPLICATIONS WERE WRITTEN IN PL/I : IT'S MUCH EASIER
      TO USE THAN SETTING UP TSO CMD PROCESSORS. IF YOU DON'T HAVE
      PL/I WE HAVE THE OLD FREEBIE PL/I F WHICH STILL WORKS ON XA !!!
      WE CAN GIVE YOU THIS IF YOU WANT IT. SOME MINOR CHANGES
      WILL STILL ALLOW THESE TO WORK. (WE CAN ALSO GIVE YOU FORTRAN
      IV H (NOT EXTENDED) AND FORTRAN IV G AS THESE STILL WORK (EVEN
      ON XA AND THESE WERE FREE : LAST SUPPLIED BY OS REL 21.8 !!!!).

      YOU CAN ALSO USE THE GENERAL IDEA AND WRITE THESE IN COBOL OR
      ANY OTHER LANGUAGE YOU WANT BUT PL/I IS THE EASIEST. (WE DON'T
      HAVE C OR PASCAL UNFORTUNATELY).

      THESE PROGRAMS SHOW YOU HOW EASY IT IS TO USE ISPF FROM A
      COMPILED PROGRAM WHICH WILL GIVE YOU MUCH BETTER PERFORMANCE
      THAN BY USING CLISTS. ONCE YOU HAVE GOT THE IDEA I'M SURE YOU
      CAN THINK OF OTHER APPLICATIONS TO DEVELOP!!


      IEFU29 SMFPG1 SMFPG2 PGMS TO AUTOMATICALLY START
      DUMPING AN SMF DATASET WHEN FULL OR I SMF ISSUED
      AND AT NIGHT TO COPY THE TEMPORARY DATASETS CREATED DURING
      THE DAY TO DAILY WEEKLY AND MONTHLY DATASETS.
      ALL YOUR OPERATORS NEED TO DO IS MOUNT TAPES.
      ONE MINOR PROBLEM IS DO NOT ISSUE ZEOD AFTER JES2 STOPS
      AS THE SMF DATASET WILL BE FLAGGED AS READY FOR DUMPING
      BUT THE JOB TO DUMP AND CLEAR IT CANNOT START AS THERE IS NO
      JES2 FOR IT TO RUN UNDER. IF IT HAPPENS DUMP IT MANUALLY
      NEXT TIME JES2 STARTS.


      (SOURCE FOR CATALOG MANAGEMENT, TSO INTERFACE AND
       DYNAMIC ALLOCATION ALSO INCLUDED : SEE CODE)

       INTSTART AND PLIOPER: USE THESE TO TEST THE EXIT BEFORE
       YOU ACTUALLY INSTALL IEFU29! IT WORKS BUT I LIKE TO BE
       SURE BEFORE I CRASH 2 3083 MACHINES !!

       INVFIND  PROGRAM TO DETERMINE IF A MEMBER EXISTS IN A PDS
                OR NOT. USEFUL FOR CALLING FROM PL/I OR OTHER
                HIGH LEVEL LANGUAGES.

       SMF1415  QUICK PROGRAM TO SCAN A DUMPED SMF DATASET TO SEE
                WHAT JOBS USED A NON VSAM DATASET.

       SMFDS    STATUS OF THE SYSTEM SMF DATASETS (MVS/370 OR XA ONLY)
                THIS PROGRAM MUST USE THE VSAM SMF DATASETS. IT WILL
                NOT WORK ON THE OLD NON VSAM SMF DATASETS
                (PRE MVS SEII DAYS)

       REVSMF   ONLINE BROWSE OF A DUMPED SMF DATASET. NORMAL ISPF
                CAN'T HANDLE VBS RECORDS.

========================================================================

WHATS NEW THIS MONTH :  (MAY 85)

      $ACTIVE  VERY QUICK ACTIVE DISPLAY PROGRAM FOR XA

      ABENDS  LIST OF COMMON ABENDS. ITS IN THE HELP DATASET ON THIS
               TAPE. TO USE ENTER HELP ABENDS OPERAND(ABEND CODE)

      APFPGM   THESE TWO ALLOW EXECUTION OF EITHER AN AUTHORIZED PGM
      APFCMD   OR A COMMAND PROCESSOR UNDER FROM TSO. OPER AUTHORITY
               REQUIRED. ALSO ALLOWS YOU TO SPECIFY THE DD NAME TO
               BE USED AS A TASKLIB. SAVES DYNAMIC STEPLIB CHANGES.
               YOU NEED TO TURN AUTH BIT ON VIA AN SVC.

      CMD      THE NON AUTHORIZED VERSION OF THE SAME PROGRAM
      PGM      (THIS IS ALMOST A CLONE OF THE ABOVE BUT IT DOES NOT
                NEED AN SVC TO GET AUTHORIZED NOR CHECKS FOR OPER)

      CDSCB    MODIFY A FORMAT-1 DSCB. MODIFIED THIS PROGRAM TO
               ONLY CHECK FOR OPER AUTHORITY INSTEAD OF BY SPECIFIC
               USER-IDS. A USER SVC GETS IT AUTHORIZED SO IT CAN RUN
               UNDER SPF. IF YOU DONT WANT TO USE A USER SVC LINK
               IT INTO AN AUTHORIZED LIBRARY AND USE THE APFCMD
               TO CALL IT FROM TSO.

      HEL       FULL SCREEN  HELP FACILITY. ALLOWS YOU TO GET A
                HELP MEMBER AND THEN SCROLL IT BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS.
                USEFUL FOR THOSE HELP COMMANDS THAT HAVE LOTS
                OF COMPLICATED OPERANDS.


      LOCDSN     LOCATE A DATASET FROM ANY ONLINE VOLUME.
                 FIXED TO USE NEW UCB LOOKUP ROUTINE SO IT WILL
                 ALSO RUN ON  XA. ADDED OPTIONAL PROMPT TO RESTRICT
                 VOLUME SEARCH TO A SPECIFIC VOLUME OR A GENERIC
                 SEARCH AS WELL AS ALL. (WE HAVE ABOUT 160 3380
                 DEVICES ONLINE AND IT CAN TAKE A WHILE TO SEARCH
                 ALL THESE PACKS!!!! YOU MAY HAVE MORE).

      PDSV7      OBTAINED VERSION 7.0 OF PDS COMMAND.
                 WE HAVE DROPPED SUPPORT FOR ALL PREVIOUS RELEASES
                 BUT CAN GET IT FOR YOU ON REQUEST.

      PDSSCAN    SCAN A PDS FOR OCCURRENCE OF A GIVEN STRING.
                 SEE THE CODE FOR JCL AND INSTRUCTIONS.
                 (THIS IS NOT INTENDED TO BE A PDS EDITOR WHICH IS ALSO
                 ON THE TAPE BUT A VERY QUICK SCANNING PROGRAM).

      QUEUE     OBTAINED QUEUE FOR SP 1.3.3 AND 1.3.4
                ALSO WORKS ON XA 2.1.1 AND XA 2.1.2
                SEE MEMBER QASM133 IN THE CNTL DATASET FOR DETAILS
                ON ASSEMBLING IT AND $$INST ON CUSTOMIZING IT.
                (WE HAVE DROPPED QUEUE FOR RELEASES LOWER THAN 1.3.3
                 BUT CAN PROVIDE YOU WITH IT ON REQUEST).

      VSAMBR    THE PROGRAM CALLED FOR BROWSING A VSAM DATASET
                UNDER ISPF. YOU MUST COPY THE PANEL AND THE CLIST
                BOTH CALLED VSAMBR. ALSO CHANGE CLIST TEMPORARY
                DATASET ALLOCATION VOLUME SERIAL NR TO ONE YOU
                ACTUALLY HAVE IN YOUR SHOP !!!!

      WHOHAS    FIXED FOR S0C4 ABEND. PROGRAM NOW WORKS ON EITHER
                MVS/SP OR MVS XA. (SORRY FOLKS COPIED THE WRONG
                MODULE LAST TIME---SOMETIMES WE ARE AHEAD OF THE
                CONNBANK PEOPLE!).

========================================================================

WHATS NEW THIS MONTH :  (APR 85)

       CDSCB   NICE LITTLE PROGRAM TO RESET A BROKEN TYPE 1 DSCB
               TO WHAT IT SHOULD BE E.G RECFM=U IN DSCB FOR
               LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=3020 DATASET. COMMANDS ARE GIVEN
               IN REAL ENGLISH--NOT A STRING OF HEX DIGITS.

       CLRSCRN  LITTLE PROGRAM TO ERASE A 3270 SCREEN. WORKS ON BOTH
                XA AND MVS

       DA       UPDATED VERSION OF CHIMP MONITOR PROGRAM.
                THIS WILL SHOW YOU AT A GLANCE WHATS GOING ON IN
                YOUR SYSTEM.
                THIS WILL RUN ON EITHER XA OR SP PROVIDED
                YOU SET THE SYSTEM VARIABLE TO 3 FOR XA OR
                2 FOR SP BEFORE ASSEMBLING IT. I'VE INCLUDED DISPLAY
                FOR STEP ELAPSED TIME INSTEAD OF THE SERVICE UNIT
                DISPLAY BUT HAVE LEFT THE CODE IN COMMENTED OUT
                SO IF YOU WANT YOU CAN CHANGE IT BACK AGAIN.
                I'VE ALSO ADDED TO THE OPTIONS LINE THE NUMBER
                OF TSO USERS LOGGED ON, THE NUMBER OF BATCH JOBS
                CURRENTLY EXECUTING AND THE NUMBER OF INITATORS
                AVAILABLE. (PROGRAMS #TSO AND #JOBS ARE CALLED
                AND I'VE INCLUDED THEM IN THE SAME MEMBER AS DA.
                NOTE FOR NON-XA USERS TAKE OUT AMODE AND RMODE
                VALUES IN THESE TWO PROGRAMS BEFORE ASSEMBLING).
                READ THE CODE ON SETTING THE SYSTEM VARIABLE.
                THIS IS A NEAT LITTLE PROGRAM WHICH DOES NOT HAVE
                TO RUN AUTHORIZED.

       DISKMAP  EXTREMLY FAST AND USEFUL DISK MAPPING PROGRAM.
                SEE THE COMMENTS IN THE CODE TO SEE WHAT IT CAN DO.

       IPLED    NEAT LITTLE PROGRAM TO TELL YOU DATE AND TIME
                WHEN YOUR SYSTEM WAS LAST IPLED. (DO OPERATORS ALWAYS
                SPEAK GOSPEL TRUTH?)
                THIS PROGRAM WORKS ON BOTH XA AND MVS/SP WITHOUT
                CHANGE (FOR ONCE).
                IT ALSO TELLS YOU INTERESTING THINGS LIKE WHETHER
                A CLPA WAS DONE, IPL VOLUME OPERATING SYSTEM PRODUCT
                FMID CPU SERIAL NR AND MODEL,SMF SYSID AND REAL STORAGE.

       OSDITTO  3 MODULES OF THE OLD OSDITTO PROGRAM THAT HAVE
                BEEN FIXED FOR MVS/SP. NOTE THAT THIS IS THE 1973
                PROGRAM WHICH BECAME YOURS AFTER 12 PAYMENTS
                AND NOT THE EXTENDED VERSION WHICH IS A LICENSED
                PRODUCT.
                SUPPORT HAS BEEN ADDED FOR 3350 3375 AND 3380 DISKS
                MODULES ARE OSDITTO,DITTOXXX,DITTODID AND ARE ALL
                CONTAINED IN MEMBER OS DITTO.
                (NOTE DITTODID DOES NOT WORK UNDER MVS/SP AT THE
                 MOMENT BUT YOU CAN USE THE VERSION FOR THE DID
                 FUNCTION THAT I USED ON XA---SEE COMMENTS UNDER
                 XA DITTO).

       SCNVTCAT  CATALOG BUILDING TOOL (VSAM AND ICF CATALOGS)
                 TO CONVERT CVOLS(UGH!!) TO ICF/VSAM CATALOG ENTRIES.
                 UNFORTUNATELY I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO MAKE THIS WORK
                 ON XA AS THERE IS A CALL TO DEVNAMET(SYSTEM DEVICE
                 TYPE/ENTRY NAME TABLE). I HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT HOW
                 XA GETS THE SAME INFO AS DEVNAMET DOES NOT EXIST IN XA
                 MAYBE ONE OF YOU CAN FIX IT FOR XA.
                 THIS PROGRAM WAS ALSO CULLED FROM A VERY EARLY IPO
                 RELEASE.


       XADITTO  OS DITTO FOR XA INC SUPPORT FOR 3350,3375,3380 DEVICES

       XADID     DID FUNCTION FOR XA

       XADITXXX OS DITTO XXX FUNCTION FOR XA

                 PLEASE NOTE HOWEVER THAT YOU MUST BE LICENSED
                 FOR DSF IF YOU WANT TO USE THE DID FUNCTION OF
                 OS DITTO. =======> NOTE THAT THIS IS AN UPDATE OF
                 THE OLD NON-EXTENSIONS VERSION OF OSDITTO
                 WHICH IS AN UNLICENSED PROGRAM.

                 THERE ARE 1 OR 2 VERY MINOR BUGS IN
                 IT STILL SUCH AS NOT ACCEPTING THE WHOLE
                 PROMPT LINE BUT ITS SUCH A USEFUL TOOL THAT
                 IM PUTTING IT OUT NOW. I HOPE TO HAVE IT 100%
                 FIXED SOON. THE WHOLE WTO MULTI LINE HANDLING
                 IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ON XA AND THERE WERE
                 NUMEROUS OTHER CHANGES SUCH AS UCB LOOKUP ETC.
                 CODE IS COMMENTED WHERE APPLICABLE.
