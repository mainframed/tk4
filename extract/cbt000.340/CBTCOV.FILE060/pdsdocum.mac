METHOD OF SCRATCHING PDS MEMBERS THAT WERE LINKED PRIOR TO A
SPECIFIED PARAMETER DATE.

AN ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE PROGRAM NAMED PDSEXTRA EXTRACTS DIRECTORY
AND LOAD MODULE DATA FROM A SPECIFIED PDS. THE DIRECTORY DATA
EXTRACTED INCLUDES PDS NAME,VOLUME AND SERIAL NUMBER, SSI, ENTRY
POINT, ATTRIBUTES, CONTINQUOUS STORAGE FLAG, LOAD MODULE TYPE,
ALIAS FLAG, AND LOAD MODULE ADDRESS. THE LOAD MODULE DATA INCLUDES
CSECT NAMES CALLED BY THE PROGRAM AND ITS LINKAGE DATE. THE PDS TO
BE USED FOR THIS EXTRACTION IS SPECIFIED IN THE JCL USED TO EXECUTE
PDSEXTRA. THE PDS NAME MUST BE SPECIFIED IN BOTH THE LOADMOD AND DSN1
DD CARDS.

A SECOND ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE PROGRAM NAMED PDSPURGE ACCEPTS A SCRATCH
DATE AS AN INPUT PARAMETER AND THEN READS IN THE EXTRACTED PDS FILE.
PDSPURGE GENERATES A SCRATCH RECORD FOR ALL MODULES THAT WERE LINKED
PRIOR TO THE PARAMETER DATE. THE FORMAT OF THE SCRATCH RECORD IS
IDENTICAL TO THE FORMAT OF THE RECORDS USED BY THE IBM UTILITY PROGRAM
IEBCOPY. AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE SCRATCH RECORDS IS AS FOLLOWS:
    C    I=INPUT,O=OUTPUT
    S    M=MODULEA
    S    M=MODULEB
    S    M=MODULEC
PDSPURGE PREPARES TWO REPORTS. THE FIRST REPORT LISTS ALL MODULES THAT
ARE TO BE SCRATCH. THE SECOND REPORT LISTS ALL MODULES IN THE PDS. BOTH
REPORTS LIST THE MODULES LINKAGE DATE AND IDENTIFY ALIASES.

PDSPURGE ALSO ACCEPTS EXEMPTION RECORDS FOR MODULES THAT WERE LINKED
PRIOR TO THE PARAMETER DATE BUT ARE TO BE RETAINED IN THE PDS. AN
ILLUSTRATION OF THE EXEMPTION CARD IS INCLUDED IN THE JCL TO EXECUTE
PDSPURGE. THE EXEMPTION CARDS MUST BE SUBMITTED IN MODULE NAME SEQUENCE.

THEN, SURE ENOUGH THE THIRD PROGRAM IS IEBCOPY. THE MEMBERS THAT ARE TO
SCRATCHED ARE FIRST COPIED TO TAPE.

THE FOURTH PROGRAM IS WRITTEN IN ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE AND IS NAMED
LIBRARY2. LIBRARY2 USES THE SCRATCH RECORDS GENERATED BY PDSPURGE
TO DELETE THE MODULES.

THE SOURCE CODE, OBJECT CODE, AND LOAD MODULES FOR THE THREE ASSEMBLY
LANGUAGE PROGRAMS ARE LOCATED IN THREE FOLLOWING PARTITIONED DATA SETS.
 T63453.MVSUSER.SOURCE
 T63453.MVSUSER.OBJ
 T63453.MVSUSER.LOAD
THE JCL TO ASSSEMBLE, LINK, AND EXECUTE THESE PROGRAMS IS CALLED
PDSEXJCL AND IS LOCATED IN T63453.MVSUSER.CNTL.
