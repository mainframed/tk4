***********************************************************************
* MODIFIED FROM THE ORIGINAL CHIMP PROGRAM
*
* ORIGINAL CHIP PROGRAM IS ALSO ON THIS TAPE.
*
* MODIFICATION HISTORY IS BELOW
*
* IN CASE YOU ARE INTERESTED, THE SOURCE OF THE NAME (OR RATHER THE
* JUSTIFICATION FOR THE NAME) OF THIS SILLY PROGRAM IS/WAS:
*
*  COMPUTERIZED HEURISTIC INFORMATION MONITORING PROGRAM  (WHEW!)
*
* THIS COMMAND HAS SEVERAL DIFFERENT MODES OF DISPLAY:
*
*     I   - THIS MODE WILL DISPLAY ONLY THOSE MEMORIES WHICH ARE EITHER
*           SWAPPED IN AND RUNNING OR SWAPPED OUT BUT READY TO RUN.
*     O   - THIS MODE WILL DISPLAY ALL ACTIVE MEMORIES IN THE SYSTEM,
*           REGARDLESS OF LOCATION.
*
*   TO SWITCH BETWEEN MODES, TYPE EITHER I OR O.
*
*
*      YOU MAY ALSO ENTER OPTIONS TO RESTRICT THE OUTPUT TO ONLY
*      TSO MEMORIES (IN EITHER IN/OUT OR WAITING STATUS ACCORDING
*      TO YOUR USE OF THE I AND O OPTIONS ABOVE) OR ONLY STARTED
*      TASK/BATCH JOB MEMORIES:
*
*     T  - RESTRICTS THE OUTPUT TO ONLY TSO MEMORIES
*
*     B  - RESTRICTS THE OUTPUT TO STARTED TASK/BATCH MEMORIES
*
*     A  - RESETS THE TSO/STARTED TASK/BATCH JOB SELECTION.
*
*     S  - SELECTS ONLY SWAPPABLE ADDRESS SPACES FOR MONITORING    NTL1

*          - MISC FIXES ETC TO ORIG CBT CHIMP COMMAND.
*          - ADDED DYNAMIC DOMAIN DISPLAY AND SHUFFLED PGM TO FIT..
*
*        B) 1/2/80  M. FARMER
*          - CORRECT 0C4 IN SWITCH FROM DOMAIN TO JOBS DISPLAY

*        E) 03/22/85 MIKE HAWTHORNE   TTI CITICORP SANTA MONICA CA *JMH
*           - FIXED IT TO RUN ON XA REL 2.1.1
*           - FOR NON XA SYSTEMS CHANGE SYSTEM VARIABLE TO 2
*           - BEFORE ASSEMBLING.
*           - OUCB IS IN SQA OVER 16 MEG LINE HENCE 31 BIT ADDRESSING
*           - EXCP COUNT IS GOT FROM ASCBIOSC  FOR XA
*           - CHANGED TO USE DSECT MAPPINGS INSTEAD OF FIXED FIELDS
*           - FIXED BUG- STC'S NOW ARE TYPE S BATCH JOBS TYPE J AND
*           - TSO JOBS ARE TYPE T
*           - REMOVED SERVICE UNIT DISPLAY AND USED THIS AREA TO SHOW
*           - THE ELAPSED TIME SO FAR FOR THE CURRENT STEP. IF YOU
*           - WANT SERVICE UNITS COMMENT OUT THE ELAPSED TIME SECTION
*           - AND REMOVE COMMENTS FROM THE SERVICE UNIT SECTION.
*           - I'M STILL OLD FASHIONED ENOUGH TO WANT TO KNOW HOW
*           - LONG SOMETHING HAS BEEN RUNNING ESPECIALLY IF ITS A CPU
*           - HOGGING OR A MEMORY HOGGING MONSTER !!!!
*           - INDICATE PRIVILEGED USER (OUCBPFL)
*           - DISPLAY REAL CPU HOGGER
*           - DISPLAY TOTAL JOBS RUNNING, INITATORS AVAILABLE AND NR
*           - NR OF LOGGED ON TSO USERS ON THE OPTIONS LINE AS WELL.
*
*           NOTE : THERE ARE LOTS OF NICE PROGRAMS LIKE THIS
*                  AROUND -- SMALL,EASY TO USE AND FREE. I KNOW
*                  OMEGAMON IS NICE BUT THIS IS MUCH MORE READABLE
*                  FOR OPERATORS. THE MAIN DIFFERENCE IS THAT SEVERAL
*                  CONTROL BLOCKS IN XA ARE NOW OVER 16 MEG LINE.
*                  SOME BUT BY NO MEANS ALL CONTROL BLOCKS HAVE
*                  HAD SOME FIELDS CHANGED OR OFFSETS CHANGED.
*                  BY JUDICIOUS USE OF THE DEBUGGING HANDBOOK
*                  AND BY USING 31-BIT ADDRESSING WE CAN BREATHE
*                  NEW LIFE INTO A LOT OF THIS GOOD OLD STUFF !
