*  PURPOSE:  THIS ROUTINE IS CALLED BY PTSSRCH WHEN THE USER HAS     *
*            INDICATED NO INPUT.  ADDRALL READS THE SYSTEM ENTRY AND *
*            FINDS ALL THE FMIDS THAT THIS PTS IS RECEIVING SYSMODS  *
*            FOR, AND STORES THESE SYSMODS IN PTSSRCH'S TABLE.       *
*                                                                    *

*  OUTPUT:   THERE IS NO PRINTED OUTPUT FROM ADDRALL.  ADDRALL WILL  *
*            FILL PTSSRCH'S TABLE WITH ALL THE FMIDS IN THE SYSTEM   *
*            ENTRY, AND UPDATE THE COUNT OF # OF FMIDS(#FMIDS).      *
*                                                                    *
