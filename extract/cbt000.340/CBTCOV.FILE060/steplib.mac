*        DEVELOPER
*
*              PETER H. HAAS
*
*        FUNCTION
*
*              PROVIDE THE TSO TERMINAL USER WITH THE CAPABILITY
*              OF DYNAMICALLY DEFINING A STEP LIBRARY.
*
*        STEPLIB COMMAND
*
*              THE STEPLIB COMMAND MAY BE ISSUED WITH OR WITHOUT
*              A POSITIONAL PARAMETER WHICH SPECIFIES A DATASET
*              OR LIST OF DATASETS TO BE ALLOCATED TO THE DYNAMIC
*              STEP LIBRARY.
*
*              IF THE STEPLIB COMMAND IS ISSUED WITH A POSITIONAL
*              PARAMETER, ANY EXISTING DYNAMIC STEPLIB DATASETS ARE
*              CLOSED AND DEALLOCATED AND THE SPECIFIED DATASETS
*              ARE ALLOCATED AND OPENED.
*
*              IF THE STEPLIB COMMAND IS ISSUED WITHOUT A POSITIONAL
*              PARAMETER, ANY EXISTING DYNAMIC STEPLIB DATASETS ARE
*              CLOSED AND DEALLOCATED.  IF A STEPLIB DATASET WAS
*              SPECIFIED IN THE TSO USER LOGON PROCEDURE, THAT DATASET
*              IS REINSTATED AS A STEP LIBRARY.
*
*              DATASET NAMES NOT IN QUOTES WILL BE PREFIXED WITH
*              THE USERID AND QUALIFIED WITH THE NAME 'LOAD'.
