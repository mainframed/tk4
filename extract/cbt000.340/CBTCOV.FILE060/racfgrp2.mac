The RACFGRP2 program extracts group and connected user data from RACF
group profiles, and formats the extracted data into an output file
suitable for input to user developed programs.

Output from the RACFGRP2 program is formatted as follows:

           Columns   1-8: GROUP NAME
           Columns  9-16: SUPERIOR GROUP
           Columns 17-24: OWNER
           Column     25: UACC
           Column     26: NOTERMUACC
           Columns 27-28: NUMBER OF CONNECTED USERS
           Columns 29-36: CONNECTED USER-ID
           Column     37: GROUP AUTHORITY PF CONNECTED USER

Output from the RACFGRP2 program will be a listing of the group profile
data extracted sorted alphabetically by group profile name.

RACFGRP2 is most useful in combination with other RACF reporting
programs found on this tape; for example, combining RACFGRP2 output with
that of RACFUSER, it is possible to construct a report of RACF group
and user associations sorted by user-ID, or even user name.

RACFGRP2 must be linkedited APF authorized and run from an APF
authorized library.
