1XCVOLIST IS A UTILITY PROGRAM THAT ANALYZES OS CVOLS. A REPORT
 OF BLOCKS ALLOCATED AND USED, NUMBER OF INDEX LEVELS, AND A
 LIST OF THE CATALOG. OPTIONALLY A CHECK OF VALIDITY WILL BE
 MADE OF THE CATALOG. MULTIPLE DD CARDS CAN BE PROCESSED.

  CHKALL     - CHECK FOR CORRECT DSCBTTR POINTERS

  CHKREAL    - SAME AS CHKREAL BUT BYPASS MSS VOLUMES

  FIXALL     - CORRECT THE DSCBTTR ERRORS DYNAMICALLY

  FIXREAL    - SAME AS FIXALL, BUT BYPASS MSS VOLUMES

* NORMAL OUTPUT IS TO SYSPRINT (FBA, 133 BY X)                        *
* SOME ERROR CONDITIONS ARE SHOWN ON SYSERROR (FBA, 133 BY X)         *
* A MACHINE-READABLE EXTRACT OF THE CATALOG MAY BE WRITTEN ON         *
*  SYSUT2 (VB) WHICH WILL INCLUDE RECORDS FOR GDG INDICES.            *
*  DATA SETS, UNUSED INDEX LEVELS AND UNUSED GDG INDICES              *
*  (OTHER INDICES, ALIASES AND CVOL PTRS WILL NOT BE ON SYSUT2)       *
*  IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT SYSUT2 LRECL BE AT LEAST 1500               *
* CONTROL CARDS ARE ON SYSIN (FBA, 80 BY X)                           *
*  CONTROL CARD DATA CAN START IN COL. 1 OR LATER AND MUST BE         *
*  COMPLETED BY COL. 71 (NO CONTINUATIONS)                            *

*   DD= (MVS OR MVT). CATALOG=INDEX WHERE INDEX IS AN ALIAS FOR       *
*   AN OS CVOL WILL LIST THE INDICATED CVOL. NODE=INDEX WILL LIST     *

*   MULTIPLE LEVELS AND CAN HAVE INTERMEDIATE LEVELS OMITTED, I.E.    *
*   NODE=ABC..XYZ WILL LIST DATASETS WHOSE FIRST LEVEL OF QUALIFI-    *
*   CATION IS ABC AND WHOSE THIRD LEVEL OF QUALIFICATION IS XYZ,      *
*   ANY OTHER LEVELS OF QUALIFICATION MAY OCCUR. NODE=..XYZ IS        *
*   ALSO VALID WITH EITHER THE CATALOG= OR DD= PARAMETER. DD=DDNAME   *
*   WILL LIST THE CVOL INDICATED BY THAT DD CARD (THIS IS THE         *
*   OPERAND FOR MVT), THE DSNAME MUST BE SPECIFIED IN THE DD CARD     *
*   (USUALLY SYSCTLG, BUT MAY BE ANY DATASET IN CVOL FORMAT).         *
*  THE OPTIONS MAY FOLLOW THE FIRST OPERAND AND ARE SEPARATED FROM    *
*   IT AND EACH OTHER BY COMMAS WITH A BLANK ENDING THE OPTIONS.      *
*  THE FIRST OPTION IS 'CHECK' TO READ ALL CATALOG BLOCKS AND DO      *
*   VALIDITY CHECKING ON THE CATALOG, THIS SHOULD NOT BE NEEDED VERY  *
*   OFTEN (EVERY FEW MONTHS) AND MORE THAN DOUBLES THE EXCP COUNT.    *
*  THE SECOND OPTION IS 'GDG=N' WHERE IS A 1-4 DIGIT NUMBER GIVING    *
*   THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF GENERATIONS BEFORE GDG INDICES ARE LISTED   *
*   ON SYSERROR (DEFAULT IS GDG=8). IF GDG=255 IS SPECIFIED, NO       *
*   INDICES WILL BE LISTED FOR EITHER EXCESSIVE GENERATION COUNT      *
*   OR BECAUSE THE GENERATION INDEX SPECIFIES 'NODELETE'.             *
*  THE THIRD OPTION IS 'NODE=INDEX' WHERE ONLY 'INDEX.' DATA SETS     *
*   ARE TO BE LISTED AND THE CATALOG WAS ALLOCATED WITH DD=DDNAME     *
*   CATALOG=INDEX (WHERE THE TWO INDICES ARE DIFFERENT).              *
*  THE FOURTH OPTION IS 'SEEK' AND WILL DO A SEEK ANALYSIS ON THE     *
*   CATALOG STRUCTURE (OR THE PART YOU ARE LISTING).                  *
*  THE FIFTH OPTION IS 'FH' WHICH IS THE SAME AS 'SEEK' BUT IF        *
*   PART OF THE CATALOG RESIDES ON THE FIXED HEAD PORTION OF A        *
*   3340 OR 3350, ANY MOVEMENT INTO THAT AREA IS TREATED AS A FIXED   *
*   HEAD SEEK SEEK, ANY MOVEMENT OUT OF THE FIXED HEAD AREA IS        *
*   CALCULATED BASED ON THE LAST USED CYLINDER.                       *
*  THE SIXTH THROUGH NINTH OPTIONS ARE 'CHKALL', 'CHKREAL',           *
*   'FIXALL' AND 'FIXREAL', THEY EITHER CHECK OR CORRECT THE          *
*   DSCB TTR'S IN THE CATALOG. 'ALL' OR 'REAL' REFERS TO ALL          *
*   DASD OR REAL (NON-MSS) DASD BEING CHECKED. CHECKING MSS           *
*   CAN BE VERY SLOW DUE TO THE MOUNT TIME.                           *
*  THE TENTH OPTION IS 'EXIT=XXXXXXXX' WHERE XXXXXXXX IS A 1-8        *
*   CHARACTER EXIT PROGRAM NAME. THIS PROGRAM RECEIVES CONTROL        *
*   WHENEVER A DATA SET ENTRY IS TO BE PRINTED AND ITS RETURN         *
*   CODE TELLS WHETHER TO PRINT THE DATA SET ENTRY (ZERO) OR          *
*   NOT (NON-ZERO). THE CALL PARAMETERS ARE THE DATASET NAME,         *
*   THE DEVICE NAME OF THE FIRST VOLUME, THE VOLUME COUNT             *
*   (HALFWORD BINARY) AND THE VOLUME INFORMATION. EACH VOLUME         *
*   INFORMATION ENTRY IS TWELVE BYTES LONG AND CONSISTS OF THE        *
*   DEVICE TYPE (4 BYTES), THE VOLUME SERIAL (6 BYTES) AND THE        *
*   TAPE FILE NUMBER (HALFWORD BINARY). THE FILE NUMBER IS ZERO       *
*   FOR A DASD DATA SET. IF THE DSN IS BLANK, IT IS THE END OF        *
*   THE CATALOG, DO ANY FINAL PROCESSING IN YOUR EXIT PROGRAM.        *
