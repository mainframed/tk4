The RACFDSET program extracts data from RACF dataset profiles, and
formats the extracted data into an output file suitable for input to
user developed programs.

Output from the RACFDSET program is formatted as follows:

           Columns  1-44: Dataset name
           Columns 45-52: Resource class (should always be "DATASET")
           Columns 53-60: owner
           Column     61: UACC
           Columns 62-69: Authorized user
           Column     70: Authorized user's access authority
           Columns 71-78: Profile type ("GENERIC" or "DISCRETE")

Output from the RACFDSET program will be a listing of
the dataset profile data extracted sorted alphabetically by dataset
profile name.

RACFDSET is most useful in combination with other RACF reporting
programs found on this tape; for example, combining RACFDSET output
with that of RACFUSER, it is possible to construct a report of RACF
dataset authorizations sorted by user-ID, or even user name.

RACFDSET must be linkedited APF authorized and run from an APF
authorized library.
