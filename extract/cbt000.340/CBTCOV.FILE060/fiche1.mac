 //*                                                                   *
 //* IN ORDER TO BE COMPATABLE WITH ALL OF OUR COM MACHINES, RATHER    *
 //* THAN JUST THE DATA GRAPHIKS, THERE IS A NEW, SIMPLIFIED WAY       *
 //* TO PRODUCE MICROFICHE.  IT IS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS METHOD      *
 //* FOR PRODUCING MICROFICHE.  THE MAIN DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS       *
 //* METHOD AND THE PREVIOUS ONE IS THAT THE PREVIOUS METHOD REQUIRED  *
 //* TWO PROGRAMS TO USE, AND THIS METHOD ONLY REQUIRES ONE.  IN       *
 //* ORDER TO PRODUCE MICROFICHE, DO THE FOLLOWING.                    *
 //*                                                                   *
 //* 1.  RUN THE PROGRAM WHICH YOU WOULD NORMALLY USE TO PRODUCE A     *
 //* SYSOUT LISTING OF WHATEVER IT IS YOU WISH TO LIST.  IN THIS       *
 //* SAMPLE, WE ARE USING PDSPRINT.  INSTEAD OF PUTTING THE SYSOUT     *
 //* PRODUCED INTO A SYSOUT CLASS, CREATE A TEMPORARY DATASET WITH     *
 //* IT.  IN THE CASE OF PDSPRINT, WE PRODUCE TWO SUCH DATASETS.  IF   *
 //* YOU DO NOT KNOW THE LRECL OF THE OUTPUT DATASET, JUST LET IT      *
 //* DEFAULT TO WHATEVER THE PROGRAM PRODUCES.  THE PROGRAM WHICH YOU  *
 //* USE TO PRODUCE YOUR MICROFICHE LISTING SHOULD PRODUCE RECORDS     *
 //* OF A FIXED LENGTH, AND IT SHOULD USE ASA CONTROL CHARACTERS.      *
 //* THE VAST MAJORITY OF PROGRAMS WHICH PRODUCE LISTINGS PRODUCE      *
 //* THEM WITH THESE CHARACTERISTICS.                                  *
 //*                                                                   *
 //* 2.  PASS THE TEMPORARY DATASET WHICH YOU HAVE PRODUCED INTO       *
 //* THE FICHE1 PROGRAM AS SYSIN.  PROVIDE THE FICHE1 PROGRAM          *
 //* (LOCATED IN SSU.LOAD) WITH A TMSDISP SYSIN DATASET WHICH IS       *
 //* EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE ONE IN THIS EXAMPLE.                      *
 //*                                                                   *
 //* 3.  VIA THE TITLE DD STATEMENT, PROVIDE A TITLE WHICH IS NO       *
 //* LONGER THAN 64 CHARACTERS LONG.  INCLUDE YOUR TSO USER ID IN      *
 //* THE TITLE FOR EASY IDENTIFICATION OF YOUR FICHE (STEVE HAS TO     *
 //* DISTRIBUTE THEM, SINCE THEY ARE ALL DELIVERED TO HIM.)  IT IS A   *
 //* VERY GOOD IDEA TO INCLUDE THE DATE OF THE RUN IN THE TITLE.  IF   *
 //* YOU SPECIFY PARM=D FOR THE FICHE1 PROGRAM, IT WILL AUTOMATICALLY  *
 //* PLUG THE SYSTEM DATE INTO YOUR TITLE IN COLUMNS 57 THROUGH 64.    *
 //*                                                                   *
 //* THE OUTPUT TAPE PRODUCED BY FICHE1 WILL BE DELIVERED BY THE       *
 //* OPERATORS TO THE COM ROOM.  THE FICHE WILL BE PRODUCED AND        *
 //* MAILED TO STEVE.  STEVE WILL GIVE THE FICHE TO YOU.  THIS MAKES   *
 //* TWO COPIES.  THE ORIGINAL IS KEPT IN THE COM ROOM FOR 90 DAYS     *
 //* IN CASE YOU NEED MORE COPIES.                                     *
 //*                                                                   *
 //* THE TAPE WHICH GOES TO COM SHOULD BE BLOCKED (AS IN THIS EXAMPLE) *
 //* AT 3724.  IT MAY BE BLOCKED AT LESS THAT 3724 IF NECESSARY.  IT   *
 //* MUST BE DEN=3.                                                    *
 //*                                                                   *
 //* YOUR TITLE WILL APPEAR AS THE TOP LINE OF EACH FRAME IN YOUR      *
 //* FICHE.                                                            *
 //*                                                                   *
