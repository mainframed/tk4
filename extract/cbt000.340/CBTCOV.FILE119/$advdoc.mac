  I.  CONTENTS

      1.  TAPE IS IBM IEBCOPY UNLOADED PDS, STANDARD LABEL, 9T,
          6250 BPI, DSN=ADVENT.TAPE, VOL=SER=ADVENT.
      2.  MEMBERS CONTAIN DOCUMENTATION, FORTRAN AND ASSEMBLER SOURCE,
          JCL, AND DATA BASE FILE.
      3.  * WARNING *  DO NOT NUMBER ANY MEMBERS AS THIS WILL DESTROY
          COMMENTS AND/OR DATA.


 II.  INSTALLATION.

      1.  LOAD THE PDS USING IBM IEBCOPY PROGRAM.
          A.  THE PDS WILL REQUIRE AT LEAST 2 3350 CYLINDERS AND 11
              DIRECTORY BLOCKS IF THE
              DCB=(RECFM=FB,BLKSIZE=3120,LRECL=80).
          B.  ALLOCATE A DATA SET TO CONTAIN THE INITIAL SETUP.  THIS
              WILL BE WRITTEN BY ADVWIZ AND SUBSEQUENTLY READ BY ADVENT.
              THIS IS WRITTEN WITH A FORTRAN UNFORMATTED WRITE AND I
              DONT BELIEVE THE DCB INFORMATION IS NECESSARY.  HOWEVER,
              MY DATASET SHOWS DCB=(RECFM=VBS,BLKSIZE=13030,LRECL=13026)
              AT LEAST ONE 3330 CYLINDER IS REQUIRED.
      2.  COMPILE AND ASSEMBLE ALL MODULES.
      3.  LINK EDIT ADVWIZ AND ADVENTURE MODULES.
      4.  EXECUTE ADVWIZ.
      5.  NOW DETERMINE THE WIZARDS ALGORITHM.  (GOOD LUCK.)
      6.  EXECUTE ADVWIZ AGAIN AND SPECIFY ANY CHANGES YOU WANT.  THE
          INITIALIZATION FILE WILL BE CREATED.
      7.  EXECUTE ADVENT TO PLAY.


III.  FORTRAN DD REQUIREMENTS.

      1.  FT01F001 (UNIT 1) = ADVENTURE DATA BASE.  READ BY ADVWIZ TO
             CREATE INITIZIALIZATION FILE (SEE 2).
      2.  FT02F001 (UNIT 2) = FILE CONTAINING UNFORMATTED DATA BASE
             INFORMATION AS CREATED BY ADVWIZ.  USED TO SHORTEN
             INITIALIZATION TIME.
      3.  FT05F001 (UNIT 5) = TERMINAL INPUT
      4.  FT06F001 (UNIT 6) = TERMINAL OUTPUT
      5.  NOTE:  FT01F001 NEEDED FOR ADVWIZ ONLY
                 FT02F001 NEEDED FOR ADVENT ONLY
