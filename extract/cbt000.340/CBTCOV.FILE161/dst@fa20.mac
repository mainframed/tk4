+Upon invocation, FSLISTA  displays a menu  from which  you specify the
 options.  You can specify a single DDname only to be displayed, a  gene
 name (one  that ends  with an  asterisk), or  no DDname, in  which case
 those allocated will be selected. You can also specify that System-name
 sets be excluded  from the  display,  and/or that  only dynamically  al
 DDnames be listed.  Indicate YES or NO in the appropriate field. (Syste
 datasets are those of the form  "SYSyyddd.Thhmmss.*").

+You can also specify on  this panel that the display be sorted by DDnam
