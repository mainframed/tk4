+The%Top+command simply  moves the first line of the PDS Member List to
 of the display (it is equivalent to the ISPF Scroll command "UP MAX").

+The%Clear+command  does two  things to  the entire  PDS Member List--it
 the "RENAME"  field for  each member  (this field is  also used by SCAN
 return status information), and it removes from the Member List  those
 that have been deleted.

+The%Locate+command, which can also be abbreviated "L" or "LOC", can be
 "locate" a member. To "locate" a member, means to move that line of the
 List to the top of the display. You don't need to type the entire membe
 For example, "L S"  will  locate  the first member  name that  begins w
 letter "S", or the member nearest to (but less than) S alphabetically.
