+From the  PDS Member  List,  there  are two  types  of functions  that
 performed--those  that operate on  a single member,  and those that ope
 the entire Member List.  Functions for the PDS members are invoked via
 Codes", entered  in the "SEL" field  by the member  name.   Functions
 entire Member List are entered in the "COMMAND" line at the top of the

+Multiple Select Codes  can be entered at one time--they are processed c
