+The Switch command can be used to switch to a new Catalog List for a ne
 log Prefix, without  having to go back to the Menu.  The Switch command
 breviated "SW", and requires a Catalog Prefix operand.

+The Stack  command is  similar to  Switch except that  the new Catalog
 "stacked"  on top  of the  current,  i.e., when "END"  is entered from
 Catalog List, control is returned to the Current Catalog List.  The STA
 mand is abbreviated "ST", and also requires a Catalog Prefix operand.
