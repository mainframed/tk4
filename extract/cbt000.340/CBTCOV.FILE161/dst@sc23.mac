+You can also specify  that a member is to be  selected  if it contains
 character string.   SCAN PDS  will scan  the member  for the  string--i
 found then the member will be placed in the Member List.

+To specify the character  string, enter "Y" in the "By Character String
 on the menu.  A subsequent menu will be  displayed.  On this menu, you
 the character string.  The  string is not  automatically folded to uppe
 so enter it using lower and upper case characters as required.  If you
 scan for a string  regardless of  case, then  specify "Y" in the "Ignor
 field on this display  (this is somewhat  less efficient  because every
 read has to be folded to upper case).

+The character string may be more than one word.
