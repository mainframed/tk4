!The List Catalog display built by FSLISTC contains dataset information
 datasets with the given catalog prefix.  The prefix used is displayed
 the COMMAND line.  The dataset information is listed in the scrollable
 of the display, one line for each data set. Each dataset name is shown
 the prefix, so the full dataset name for each is the prefix+dsname show

!From this display,  there are two types of  functions that can  be perf
 those that operate  on a single dataset  displayed, and those  that ope
 the entire display. Functions for the datasets are invoked via "Select
 entered in the  "SEL" field  by the  dataset  name.  Functions for the
 display are entered in the "COMMAND" line at the top of the display.

!Multiple Select Codes  can be entered at one time--they are processed c
 tively from top to bottom.
