+The%STack+command is  similar to the  SWitch command,  in that  it requ
 dataset name operand  (generic member specification allowed), and a new
 List is constructed.  The difference  is that  the new Member  List is
 (stacked)  on top of  the current one.  When  you "END" from that Membe
 it is "popped" from the  stack, and the preceding one is again displaye
 can stack as many  Member Lists as you want  (you may run out of memory
 ually, however).  Keep  in mind that  each "stacked"  Member List  is a
 invocation of the application, and you will have to respecify a Target
 (Move/Copy) and print options (Print).  The command must be specified a

+The%Scan+command  can  be  used to  scan the  members in the current di
 Member List for a  character string.  The command  displays a data entr
 in which you can specify  the character string and  other options. The
 built is a proper subset of the current Member List, although it does n
 place the current List (instead it appears to be "stacked" on top of th
 rent List, although it does not reinvoke the application  as the STack
 above would).
