+The%Free+command closes  and deallocates the dynamically-allocated SYSO
 for the Print command (this is done automatically when you exit the PDS
 List).  SCAN PDS will  re-display the  "SYSOUT Characteristics"  panel
 next Print.  This enables  you to print the PDS  members with different
 characteristics, or even to different destinations.

+The%Close+command  is analagous  to the  FREE  command  above.   It clo
 deallocates the  Target dataset specified  for previous  Move or Copy c
 (this is done automatically when you exit the PDS Member List).  SCAN P
 re-display the "Target Dataset" panel for the next Move or Copy.  This
 you to Move or Copy PDS members to different target datasets.
