+The%ADD+command  can be used to add  members to the  Member List  that
 listed, but  are contained  in the PDS  directory (or  concatenation).
 members are  not currently  listed because the Member List is a subset,
 cause the  member  entries were  removed from  the Member  List with  t
 command.

+The% Sort+command is  used to sort  the PDS Member List  on any%two+col
 ascending or descending order. Valid operands for SORT are NAME (the de
 VER, CREATED, LAST,  SIZE, INIT, MOD, ID and A  or D for ascending or d
 ing.  If the display is for a load module PDS, valid sort operands are
 TTR, SIZE, ATTR, SSI, MODE and ENTRY.

 For example, enter "SORT SIZE D ID" to sort the display by SIZE in  des
 order and by ID in  ascending order  (ascending is the  default for  al
 fields).  To return the Member  List to its  original order  (sorted by
 name in ascending order), simply enter "SORT".
