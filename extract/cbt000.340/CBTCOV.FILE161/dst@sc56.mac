+The%Mode+command can be used in Version 2 ISPF or later to jump between
 lists for Browse, Edit and PDS Member List.  In other words, you can in
 invoke Browse to get a Browse member list, then use the Mode command to
 to an Edit member list  from which you can then edit member.  Or switch
 a PDS Member  List to have all  of those functions available  (such as
 Rename, Print,  Move/Copy, etc).  The  Mode  command must  be  followed
 operand which is either%B, E+or%M.+

 or Member List  modes, and must be abbreviated  SW.  You may specify a
 member name as part of the dataset name (e.g., "SW 'TSO.MVS.CLIST(SAS*)
