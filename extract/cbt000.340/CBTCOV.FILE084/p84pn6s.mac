   The SORT command may be used to sort the MEMLIST table.

   Syntax for the SORT command is as follows:
    %SORT      MEMBER  TTR  VERMOD/VERSION  CDATE/CREATED
+   %          MDATE/MODIFIED  SIZE  ID  ASCEND/DESCEND
+
+ +where -
      %MEMBER         -+sort by MEMBER name (default)
      %TTR            -+sort by hex TTR
      %VERMOD/VERSION -+sort by VER.MOD or VERSION and mod level
      %CDATE/CREATED  -+sort by CREATED date
      %MDATE/MODIFIED -+sort by LAST MODIFIED date and time
      %SIZE           -+sort by SIZE or number of lines
      %ID             -+sort by user ID
      %ASCEND/DESCEND -+sort direction (default  ASCEND: MEM TTR ID
                                                DESCEND: all others)
   Notes: MEMBER is always assumed as the last sort field.
          ID can be used with MEMBER, VERMOD, CDATE, MDATE or SIZE.
          When used with another keyword, ID is the first sort field.
          ASCEND/DESCEND can be used once with any other keywords.
