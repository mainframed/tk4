   The Busy Function Message is given when a request is made to a
   Function to add or rebuild entries in the Function's display table.

   The Function cannot update its table because there is pending
   line command processing.  The request will be ingored.

     At this time you can continue using other services, or
     You can resume line command processing for the requested function
     by entering the Function command with no operands, or
     You can cancel line command processing using the CANCEL command
     with the operand for this function.

   The Function status display and related tutorials give more
   information on pending line commands.
