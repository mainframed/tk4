   This display provides for a list of commands that can be defined
   by the user.  The commands may be for PDS or TSO.   PDS commands
   may be any command that can be entered from the View log function.
   The TSO commands are passed to ISPF through the "SELECT CMD" service
   and thus can support any IBM or user TSO command or CLIST.
   Any entry in the list can be marked as a comment line.   The type
   of command is controlled by setting the TYPE field on each entry as
   follows:   P = PDS command,  blank or dash = TSO command or CLIST,
              * = comment    ,  T = Trap TSO command output
