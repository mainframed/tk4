   According to IBM standards, member names should begin with an
   alphabetic character and it may be followed with up to seven
   alphanumeric characters.

   In actual fact, member names in a÷PDS+directory may contain almost
   any data.  You may specify member names with imbedded special
   characters (example: A<C?23) to÷PDS+but the use of some special
   characters such as parentheses, commas, blanks, semicolons,
   asterisks, colons or slashes may cause unexpected results.

   For this reason and to allow specification of unprintable member
   names,÷PDS+allows you to enter hexadecimal member names.  Note the
   following examples for a data set containing members named A, AD, A1,
   A2, BA, BADZ, B2 and Z299:

+    MEMBERS%x'c1':x'c1'      + (would match members A, AD, A1 and A2)
+    MEMBERS%x'c1':a          + (would match members A, AD, A1 and A2)
+    MEMBERS%a:x'c1'          + (would match members A, AD, A1 and A2)
+    MEMBERS%x'c1'/           + (would match members A, AD, A2, BA and B
+    MEMBERS%x'c140'/         + (would match members A and BA)
)END
