   If a member name contains a%/+(slash), it is assumed to represent one
   or more members from the data set which contain the pattern segments
   in their member names.


   Note the following examples for a data set containing members named
   A, AD, A1, A2, BA, BADZ, B2 and Z299:

+    MEMBERS%/                 +(would output an error message)
+    MEMBERS%a/                +(would match members A, AD, A1, A2, BA a
+    MEMBERS%/ba               +(would match members BA and BADZ)
+    MEMBERS%ba/               +(would match members BA and BADZ)
+    MEMBERS%ad/               +(would match members AD and BADZ)
+    MEMBERS%ad/ba             +(would match member BADZ)
+    MEMBERS%99/z2             +(would match member Z299)
+    MEMBERS%z299/             +(would match member Z299)
+    MEMBERS%2/                +(would match members A2, B2 and Z299)
+    MEMBERS%3/                +(would match no members)
+    MEMBERS%a2345678/b2345678 +(would match no members)
