   The TRAP service provides for executing TSO commands and trapping
   there output and placing the output in the PDS session view log.
   For this service to work the system must have installed ISPF 2.3
   and TSO/E and the PDS clist PDSTRAP must also be placed in a
   library which is part of the SYSPROC ddname.

   This service uses the TSO/E feature SYSOUTTRAP.  This feature
   used through the PDSTRAP clist.  Any TSO command that uses PUTLINE
   coding to display output to the screen can be trapped.  Output using
   TPUT coding will go directly to the screen and cannot be trapped.
   Output from CLIST commands cannot be trapped by PDSTRAP.
