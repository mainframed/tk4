  ÖPDS+is a TSO command for Partitioned Data Sets.  You can control
  ÖPDS+with subcommands which manipulate the entire partitioned data
   set or process individual partitioned data set members.

  ÖPDS+has not yet been initialized; you are requested to enter the
   names of a subset of members that are to be in the initial member
   list (or MEMLIST).  The member information entered will be formatted
   into standardÖPDS+member notation and saved for theÖPDS+entry panel.

   For more information on PDS, press%ENTER+to display the next screen
   which is a directory for most of the ISPF tutorial information on
   PDS.  Additional information is available in the HELP data set;
   a panel to assist you with the help information may be obtained
   by entering%O.HE+from an ISPMODE or MEMLIST panel in PDS.
