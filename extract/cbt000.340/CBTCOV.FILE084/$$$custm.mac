               CUSTOMIZING PDS TO ADD FUNCTION

    This document discribes how to use the ISPF facilities
    built into PDS for the express purpose of allowing users
    to add functions to PDS.  This can be done without
    modifying PDS internal code.  The facilities of ISPF
    found in panel processing provide a handy interpetive
    langage for selecting and formatting commands. Through
    the use of ISPF panels supplied by the user, the user
    can code new function into PDS.  The same panels are part
    of the option selection displays of PDS thus providing user
    documentation of the added function.  Through this facility
    the user can define a new PDS command that translates into
    a complex request made up of a standard PDS command with
    several operands.  Additional commands can be added to
    format a TSO command or pass PDS data to a user process
    such as a CLIST or user dialog program.

    The facilities are activated when PDS has determand that a
    command is not one of the standard PDS commands.  The
    command is passed to a designated user panel.  The command
    is placed in the dialog variable ZCMD commonly used within
    ISPF as the command input variable.  The designated panel
    is invoked with the non-display feature.  This allows the
    panel's INIT and PROC sections to process the command.
    These sections can then format a request to be processed
    by PDS as a PDS command or as an external process using the
    ISPF select service.  The request is returned to PDS by
    placing the request string in the variable PDSSEL.

    The panel can also be invoked in the display mode as part
    of the option selection display feature of PDS.  When a
    user request the O option a selection panel is displayed.
    This panel will have a selection that will invoke the
    user panel.  The user can then select any of the user
    commands and the panel processing section will build
    the request string in the same manner.

    A typical process is to isolate the command using a TRUNC
    built-in function combined with the TRANS built-in function
    to relate the command to a request string.  The request
    string if constructed using literals and PDS, ISPF, and
    user supplied variables.  Within the sample user panels
    supplied with PDS are sample related pairs imbeded in the
    TRANS built-in function parameter list.  The user can add
    his own pairs using EDIT.  Experenced ISPF panel programmers
    can take advantage of the several processing statements
    for more complex request formatting. Some of the designated
    panels process commands entered on the command line, others
    process commands entered in the option field for line
    commands.

    EXAMPLES

       ACTIVE,'MEMLIST : LAST(8) USERID(&ZUSERID)'

            ACTIVE is a command to request a member list of source
            members that have been updated by the user recently.
            This example would be used in panel P84OPUX to create
            a new command entered on the command line.
            Note the use of &ZUSERID in the USERID filter options.
            The option LAST(8) defines "recent".

       NONE,'ATTRIBUTE &PDSMEM NOREF NORENT NOREUS'

            NONE is a line command for a loadlib member list.
            This example would be used in panel P84LLUX to create
            a new line command to remove attributes from a load
            module.  Note the use of &PDSMEM to indicate the
            member from the table line selected.

       PRDS,'CMD(PRINTDS DATASET(''&PDSDSN(&PDSMEM)'') )'

            PRDS is a line commmad for a source member list.
            This example would be used in panel P84LOUX to create
            a new line command to print the member using the
            new TSO/E R.4 PRINTDS command. Note the use of both
            &PDSDSN and &PDSMEM to pass the dataset and member
            to the TSO command.  The ISPF select service is
            requested by providing the format 'CMD(...)'.

       ASM,'CMD(%ASMCL &PDSMEM  &PDSDSN )'

            ASM is a line commmad for a source member list.
            This example would be used in panel P84LOUX to create
            a new line command to assemble the member using a user
            clist.  The member and fully qualified data set name
            without quotes are passed to the clist as separate
            parameters to simplify clist processing.  A sample
            clist is supplied with PDS.

       SUM,'PGM(LOADSUM) PARM(&PDSDSN)'

            SUM is a commmad for a load library.  This example
            would be used in panel P84OPUX to create a new command
            to call a user program to summerize attributes of the
            library.  The fully qualified data set name without
            quotes are passed to the program as a parm.
            This is an example only, no such program exists.

    A typical case for formating a TSO command may require
    additional input from the user to include TSO command operands.
    A new command can cause PDS to display a new user panel.
    This new panel would prompt the user for additional data.
    After the data have been supplied and the user hits the ENTER
    key the processing section of the panel can then format the
    request.  Likewise the panel to to displayed could be a
    standard PDS entry panel to which the user want a direct path.

       PT,'PANEL(P84LOPR)'

            PT is a line commmad for a source member list.
            This example would be used in panel P84LOUX to create
            a new line command to go directly to the PRINT option
            entry panel.

       ALC,'PANEL(P84ALCMN)'

            ALC is a line command for either source or load members.
            This example would be used in panels P84LOUX and P84LLUX
            to create a line command for allocating the library and
            member to a DDNAME.  The user panel would have entry
            lines for DDNAME and type allocation (SHR/OLD).
            The processing section would look like this.

            VER(&DDNAME,NB,NAME)
            VER(&STAT,LIST,OLD,SHR)
            IF (&PDSVOL = &Z)  &CVOL=&Z
            IF (&PDSVOL ^= &Z) &CVOL=' VOL(&PDSVOL) UNIT(SYSALLDA)'
            &AL='ALLOCATE'
            &AD='&CVOL &STAT'
            &PDSSEL='CMD(&AL DD(&DDNAME) DA(''&PDSDSN(&PDSMEM)'') &AD)'

            Note the use of VER built-in function and the use of
            IF to build the conditional volume allocation operands.

    Several commands are already provided in the panels.
    Additional ideas for use in the various panels are found in the
    appendix.  Also included in the appendix is a list of sample
    clists.
