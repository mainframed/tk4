-Introduction
+____________
0This  document outlines  the  installation  procedures for  the  PagePl
 graphics subroutines library and all associated materials.  The system
 packaged  in four  tape  files, which  contain all  of  the source  cod
 documentation,  load modules,  character  sets  and sample  output.   T
 library consists of a number  of CalComp-compatible subroutines which m
 be used to generate crude graphics output  on the IBM 3800 and Xerox 97
 laser printers.  This package has been used with the Statistical Analys
 System graphics  option (SAS/GRAPH)  at Statistics  Canada since  Octob
 1981 and was  demonstrated in February 1982, to the  annual conference
 the SAS  Users Group International.  The  system is easily  extensible
 provide support for additional devices which  permit the use of softwar
 generated character sets.
0This  implementation supports  both the  IBM  3800 and  XEROX 9700  las
 printers. The 3800 version requires a  printer with four WCGM's (Writab
 Character  Generation Modules)  and  the  hardware option  which  enabl
 printing at 12 lines  per inch.  Two versions of the  system are provid
 for the Xerox  9700 to allow the  use of both the  landscape and portra
 print  modes.  The  Xerox printer  is assumed  to be  installed with  t
 online interface and also  requires the presence of a tape  drive for t
 installation of  the character  fonts.  Each  implementation consists
 three elements:   a machine-readable  character set,  a machine-depende
 print control  module and a set  of assembler language  subroutines.  T
 first  two items  must  be  installed on  the  related  printer with  t
 assistance of  the system software  programmer.  The subroutines  must
 linked-edited with, and  driven by an application program  which uses t
 CalComp subroutine calling sequences.   The graphics output is  a devic
 specific print-file  which must be directed  to the proper  printer alo
 with the appropriate print control information.

0Copy the  PagePlot installation  materials from  tape onto  host comput
 online storage.  You  may use the IBM Utility  programs IEBGENER, IEBCO
 and IEBUPDTE as illustrated in sample job TAPECOPY.
0You should copy all of the materials,  identify the modules that you wi
 be able to  use, and delete the unused materials  after this installati
 is complete.
0The  tape files  needed  for the  installation,  their  contents and  t
 installation procedures to follow are described below.
0  PAGEPLOT.INSTALL

 PagePlot                Installation Instructions                  Step
0 Step 2
+ ____ _
0To use PagePlot with  the IBM 3800 and Xerox 9700  printers you must lo
 the graphics character sets onto  the appropriate printer font librarie
 Please keep in mind that the fonts and the FCB or PDL information must
 available to every  printer you wish to use.  For  example, at Statisti
 Canada both  printers are  connected to different  mainframes and  may
 accessed via JES2 shared spooling and separate SYSOUT classes from eith
 computer.  The 3800  library SYS1.IMAGELIB is stored on  system A where
 the 9700, driven  by system B, uses  a library stored on  the 9700 syst
 disk.  In larger networks, one may  expect to find different combinatio
 of devices and mainframes.
0Due to fundamental differences between these devices, the respective fo
 installation procedures  are quite different.  Both procedures  will mo
 likely require the assistance of a hardware/software specialist from yo
 operating system maintenance group.
0If your 3800 printer does not have four WCGM's you must reduce the numb
 of  characters  used  by  the  PagePlot  character  set  and  the  SYMB
 subroutine.  Character sets  and FCB's for this device are  stored in t
 system  library 'SYS1.IMAGELIB'  and  are  maintained with  the  IEBIMA
 Utility program.   The character  set is distributed  in both  source a
 load module form.   You may copy modules GRAFMOS5,  GRAFSYM5 and XTB1PL
 from PAGEPLOT.LOAD to  SYS1.IMAGELIB with IEBCOPY or  generate them usi
 sample job  IEBIMAGE.  Please note  that SYS1.IMAGELIB must  also conta
 the IBM-supplied module GRAFGS15.  Access  to SYS1.IMAGELIB will probab
 require  the cooperation  of  your system  programmer  as  it is  usual
 password protected.   The FCB for PagePlot  is not distributed  because
 similar module probably exists on your system.  If not, you must genera
 one using IEBIMAGE.
0The Xerox 9700 may be installed as  either an online printer, accessed
 a special  SYSOUT class, or  as an  offline device, accessed  by magnet
 tape.   This system  assumes the  use of  the online  interface and  so
 changes may be required to use the offline mode.  There are two charact
 fonts  for this  device in  the  library PAGEPLOT.LOAD  named RHZ2X0  a
 RHZ2XP.  These must be copied to an unlabelled 1600 BPI magnetic tape a
 installed in the 9700 font library by the machine operator.  The operat
 may generate font  sample sheets for these fonts with  a console comman
 The sample job  FONT9700 may be used  to create the font  transport tap
 An  additional  module:   PDL9700,  which  is  written   in  Xerox  Pri
 Description Language  (PDL) must  be modified to  suit your  local syst
 requirements,  transferred to  the 9700  using the  'host load'  facili
 where it will be compiled by the machine operator.

0 Step 3
+ ____ _
0You should test the PagePlot graphics  character sets installed in step
 by printing the appropriate member of  PAGEPLOT.PRINT.  The IBM 3800 fo
 may be tested  by printing member I38TEST.   The Xerox 9700 fonts  may
 exercised by  printing members  X97TEST and Y97TEST.   The first  line
 each Xerox print file  contains a DJDE statement which points  to JDL a
 JDE  statements within  module  PDL9700 (compiled  in  step  2).  If  y
 modified the JDL  or JDE names in  this module, you must  modify the DJ
 statements in the sample print files and  the DJDE statement coded in t
 appropriate  PLOTS routine.   If  any of  these  tests  fail, you  shou
 carefully review step 2 with your  one of your local software specialis
 to determine the source of the error.
0In  addition  to the  sample  graphics  print files,  the  PAGEPLOT.PRI
 dataset  contains three  datasets  which  provide documentation  for  t
 system.  Member  INSTALL  contains   these  instructions;  member  SYSD
 contains  system documentation;  and  member  SUGI82 contains  the  pap

 PagePlot                Installation Instructions                  Step
0 Step 4
+ ____ _
0The PagePlot software is distributed in  both source and load module fo
 wherever  possible.   The  subroutines  were  written  in  IBM  Assembl
 Language  and make  use  of  Statistics Canada's  structured  programmi
 macros which are  included with the source programs.  Most  of the sour
 is common to all three versions of the system and the names of the comm
 modules begin  with the letters 'PLT'.   There are three versions  of t
 PLOTS subroutine:   I38INIT for the IBM  3800 in addition to  X97INIT a
 Y97INIT for  landscape and portrait modes  on the Xerox 9700.   There a
 two versions  of the  PAGE internal service  subroutine: I38PAGE  for t
 3800, and  X97PAGE for  the 9700.   All versions  assume the  use of  t
 standard printer  forms in use at  Statistics Canada.  You  may customi
 these routines to provide different plotting areas with a small number
 source modifications.
0The IBM 3800  version of PagePlot is  used with forms 11  inches wide a
 8.5 inches high. The  graphics must be printed at 15  characters per in
 and 12 lines per inch.  The 3800  hardware produces a half inch margin
 all sides  reducing the useful  plotting area to  10 inches wide  and 7
 inches high. This allows  us to use 150 characters per  line and 90 lin
 per page.  The module  I38INIT may be modified to allow  the use of for
 as large  as 15 inches wide  and 11 inches  long by changing a  number
 constants as follows.  The values of PAGEW and PAGEH define the width a
 length of the plotting surface in  inches.  The constants PAGEX and PAG
 define the  number of character  cells on the  page, they are  related
 PAGEW and PAGEH as follows:
0   PAGEX = PAGEW * #chars per inch   i.e. 150 = 10  * 15
0   PAGEY = PAGEH * #lines per inch   i.e.  90 = 7.5 * 12
0These constants must be calculated prior to assembly.  The constants XI
 and YINC define the  width and height of the pixels  which make up mosa
 characters  and  should  not  be  changed  unless  the  actual  charact
 dimensions change due  to the generation of  a new copy of  the charact
 set.
0The Xerox 9700  versions of PagePlot use  standard 8 1/2 x  11 inch pap
 and the values of the constants mentioned above have been determined fr
 trade-offs  related to  the  the character,  line,  and  page sizes.  O
 printer limits lines to 182 characters  and pages to approximately 19,2
 characters. Characters are defined in terms  of dots which have a densi
 of 300 dots per inch.  The characters  used for the PagePlot fonts are
 dots wide and  24 dots high. The  landscape version of the  PLOTS routi
 uses  182 columns  and  94 lines  (17,108 characters  per  page) and  t
 portrait version 150 columns and 125  lines (18,750 characters per page
 The corresponding  values for PAGEW are  9.706667 and 8.0 inches  and t
 values for PAGEH are 7.52 and 10.0 inches, for the landscape and portra
 versions in both cases. The form size for this device is not variable b
 the  plot  area can  be  modified.   Plot  resolution may  be  marginal
 improved by  using smaller  characters, but  this must  be balanced  wi

0reductions in  the size  of the plotting  surface.  These  character se
 were generated using the Mediamatics  Fontbuilder program and any chang
 to the fonts will require the  purchase of this software from Mediamati
 or the acquisition of a functional equivalent.
0The  two versions  of  the PLOTS  subroutine for  the  9700 (X97INIT  a
 Y97INIT) are  intended to generate  landscape and portrait  mode graphi
 respectively. The constant DJDE contains a  Xerox DJDE statement which
 written as the first record of the plot file to identify the print form
 to be used.  This  statement points to JDL and JDE  statements in the P
 module compiled on the printer in step 2.  This PDL module identifies t
 print  mode,  character fonts  and  partially  defines  the size  of  t
 plotting surface.  Modifications to this statement and the PDL9700 modu
 may be neccessary to conform to your installation requirements.
