         TITLE 'TSO CALCULATOR PROGRAM DRIVER'
*--------------------------------------------------------------*
*        THIS PROGRAM IS USED TO CALL THE TSO CALCULATOR       *
*        PROGRAM. WE WROTE IT BECAUSE WHEN THE CALC PROGRAM    *
*        WAS EXECUTED LIKE A TSO COMMAND PROCESSOR A NASTY     *
*        MESSAGE WAS PRODUCED ( IBM003I ). IT DID NOT HURT     *
*        BUT IT LOOKED AWFUL AND DIRTY.  THIS WAS A QUICK      *
*        AND DIRTY WAY TO CIRCUMVENT THE MSG.                  *
