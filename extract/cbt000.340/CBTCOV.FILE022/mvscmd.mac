*     This program accepts system or JES2 operator commands as        *
*     input and executes them using SVC 34. It must be APF            *
*     authorized.                                                     *
*                                                                     *
*     COMMAND can operate in one of three modes:                      *
*                                                                     *
*     1) Batch or CALLed program                                      *
*        In this mode COMMAND accepts input as either 80-byte         *
*        card images from SYSIN or a single command from the PARM     *
*        field. The response to the operator command will             *
*        appear on all operator consoles. For example:                *
*                                                                     *
*           //STEP1    EXEC PGM=COMMAND,PARM='VARY 017,ONLINE'        *
*                                                                     *
*           - or -                                                    *
*                                                                     *
*           //STEP1    EXEC PGM=COMMAND                               *

*           VARY 017,ONLINE                                           *
*           /*                                                        *
*                                                                     *
*     2) TSO Command Processor                                        *
*        In this mode COMMAND expects to find the operator command    *
*        directly following on the TSO input line. The response to    *
*        OS commands will then be displayed on the TSO terminal.      *
*        Response to JES2 commands will appear on all consoles.       *
*        For example:                                                 *
*                                                                     *
*           COMMAND D T         <--- (Response will appear on CRT)    *
*                                                                     *
*     3) Callable subroutine                                          *
*        In this mode COMMAND accepts input according to standard     *
*        OS linkage conventions. In addition to the command itself,   *
*        a second parameter may be passed which contains the          *
*        console number where you wish the response to appear.        *
*        (The SVC 34 will also assume the authority of that           *
*        console.) For example:                                       *
*                                                                     *
*           LA       R1,CMDADDR                                       *
*           LA       R15,=V(COMMAND)                                  *
*           BALR     R14,R15                                          *
*                                                                     *
*           CMDADDR  DC    A(OPERCMD)                                 *
*           CNSADDR  DC    XL1'80',AL3(CONSOLE)                       *
*           OPERCMD  DC    H(3),CL3'D T'                              *
*           CONSOLE  DC    F'5'                                       *
*                                                                     *
*        This would make it appear as if 'D T' were issued from       *
*        console 5. (This method is used by program 'SPY')            *
*                                                                     *
*     Just prior to issuing a command via SVC 34, COMMAND will        *
*     issue a WTO of the form                                         *
*                                                                     *

*     This will appear on the operator's console and in SYSLOG.       *
*                                                                     *
*     COMMAND may be used to issue replies to WTORs. Since the        *
*     reply may be sensitive (for example, a password) COMMAND        *
*     will supress it whenever a REPLY is issued.                     *
*                                                                     *
