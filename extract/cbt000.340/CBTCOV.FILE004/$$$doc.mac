//***FILE 006 CONTAINS SEVERAL PROGRAMS USED FOR MANIPULATION OF    *
//*           THE CBT TAPE AND CBT OVERFLOW TAPE DOCUMENTATION.     *
//*                                                                 *
//*           The program called CBTUPD is for the purpose of       *
//*           introducing appropriately named ./ ADD NAME= cards    *
//*           into strategic places of the CBT Tape Documentation.  *
//*           The CBT Tape doc can then be conveniently broken      *
//*           up into a pds.  The member names of the pds are       *
//*           in collating sequence order (EBCDIC), so that the     *
//*           members can be put back together as a sequential      *
//*           file, in their proper order.                          *
//*                                                                 *
//*           The program called DOCFILE is from Arnold Casinghino  *
//*           and it puts the indicators in columns 73-80 of the    *
//*           CBT Tape documentation, to indicate your current      *
//*           position within the documentation.                    *
//*                                                                 *
//*           The original idea of the DOCFILE program is from      *
//*           a COBOL program written by Sam Barr of Northrop.      *
//*                                                                 *
//*           DOCFILE has been updated by Sam Golob (03/99) to      *
//*           take into account the fact that there may be lower    *
//*           case characters in the CBT Tape Documentation         *
//*           nowadays.                                             *
//*                                                                 *
//*           This file was moved from File 130 and the former      *
//*           File 006 was moved to File 130.  The reason for       *
//*           that, was that this file should be near the           *
//*           beginning of the CBT Tape, since it is used to        *
//*           process the CBT Tape Documentation File.              *
//*                                                                 *
//*           (Actually both of them are.  I just put this file     *
//*           more "forward", because I think more people are       *
//*           going to use it.  File 130 is for loading the         *
//*           CBT documentation into an INFO/MVS database.)         *
//*                                                                 *
//*           I've included the OSTARXMT package in this file       *
//*           to make it more available.  Documentation for         *
//*           running this package is in File 365.  The load        *
//*           module for the OSTAREDC assembler program to          *
//*           speed up error checking, is in File 035.  If you      *
//*           get CBT Tape files in OSTARXMT format (LRECL=88),     *
//*           the presence of the OSTARREC exec here, will make     *
//*           it easier for you to handle this format.  Just        *
//*           copy OSTARREC into your SYSPROC or SYSEXEC library    *
//*           and invoke it, against your .XMT files.               *
//*                                                                 *
//*    Note:  This file also contains copies of the ISPF Edit       *
//*           Macros  CBTUPDTE  and  COVUPDTE, which are used       *
//*           to introduce ./ ADD NAME= cards into the CBT Tape     *
//*           and CBT Overflow Tape documentation files.  That      *
//*           will allow them to be converted into partitioned      *
//*           datasets, using IEBUPDTE ,PARM=NEW , or PDSLOAD       *
//*           programs.                                             *
//*                                                                 *
//*           However, the CBTUPD assembler program supersedes      *
//*           these two edit macros, because it is more accurate    *
//*           in checking where to insert the ./ ADD cards,         *
//*           and is less prone to some other errors.               *
//*                                                                 *
