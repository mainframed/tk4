Brief Documentaiton:

The ISPF Edit SPELL macro has been enhanced. SPELL verifies the spelling
words in a document by invoking SCRIPT/VS.

To use it, simply enter:
     COMMAND ===> SPELL

For additional information, enter:
     COMMAND ===> SPELL ?

The new version incorporates the following new features:

o Uncataloged and VIO data sets are now supported.

o Documents greater than 80 bytes wide should no longer cause errors.

o Documents with SCRIPT control words should no longer cause errors.

o All special (nonalphanumeric) characters are now treated as SCRIPT
  word delimiters, except for single quote marks and hyphens, which are
  treated as SCRIPT punctuation characters.  That is, words containing
  single quotes or hyphens will be verified (e.g., can't, built-in).
  Words containing numeric characters are not verified (i.e., will not
  cause errors).

o BookMaster GML tags and their attributes will no longer cause errors.
  The attributes are not examined for correctness.  Unrecognized tags
  are still considered erroneous.

o You may have your own personal spelling dictionary to supplement those
  built in to SCRIPT/VS. Specify:
       COMMAND ===> SPELL Dictionary

  A panel will be displayed with instructions.

o All potentially misspelled words will be displayed in a table.  There
  will be one row per uniquely misspelled word, along with a count of
  the number of times that word was found. The table may be sorted by
  order of first occurrence in the text, by the number of times the word
  was found, or alphabetically. Line commands allow you to:

    . add correctly spelled words to your personal spelling dictionary;
    . correct all occurrences of a word in the text;
    . exclude words which are correct or of no interest.

o Adding, correcting, or excluding words affects the following
  messages:

o Messages are inserted above the first line of text stating how many
  words on how many lines were misspelled, and how many uniquely
  misspelled words were found.

o A list of uniquely misspelled words is inserted just after the above
  messages. This is the same list displayed in the above table, minus
  any words which have been removed from the table.  The list is
  compacted onto as few lines as possible.  The words are in the order
  of first occurrence in the text.

o A message is inserted just above each line containing a misspelled
  word.  The message contains all misspelled words on that line, aligned
  with the corresponding words in the line. You may correct a word by
  overtyping it or by using the CHANGE command.

o All error free lines are excluded, making it easy to find errors.
