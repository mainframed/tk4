This is the PDSXREF Dialog.

This dialog will create a member list of up to four PDS's.
Unlike the typical member lists facilities of ISPF, if there
are duplicate members, they will be shown on the member list.
Currently, the member list is used just to display duplicates;
In the future, you will be able to Browse, Edit etc...
