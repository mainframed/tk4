Description.
This TSO command prints a data set created by the 'OUTPUT'
command, with proper carriage controls, if the data set
contains either ASA or machine carriage controls or both.
It does not work right if the data set contains no carriage
controls.  It helps if the OUTPUT command is modified
to default to LRECL 133 instead of 132 (see zap below).

Syntax -
       OUTPRINT 'dsname'  CLASS(a)  DEST(remote)  HOLD COPIES(nn)

The purpose of this command is to read a data set created
by the TSO 'OUTPUT' command 'PRINT(dsname)' operand,
and print it with correct carriage controls.  The data
set often has both ASA and machine type carriage controls
mixed together, and is marked with a RECFM indicating
neither ASA nor machine controls present.

Sometimes the data set contains records with no carriage
controls at all.  This produces unpredictable results,
and there is nothing in this command that can
detect that situation, so the user just has to avoid
generating sysout that has no carriage controls if it is
to be processed by the OUTPUT command and then this command.

This command was written so that a job's sysout could be
retrieved (by OUTPUT), saved in a data set, and printed
at a later time with no separator pages between each sysout
file.  (The separator pages will be from the TSO session
that issues this command instead of the original job,
but everything else will look like the original job).

The 'OUTFILE' keyword lets you specify the DDNAME of a
pre-allocated data set to which this command will write
instead of allocating its own sysout file.  If the DCB
attributes of the OUTFILE conflict with those of the input,
unpredictable results may occur.  If the OUTFILE is a PDS
with no member specified, the directory will be destroyed.
The 'OUTFILE' keyword causes the 'CLASS', 'DEST', 'COPIES',
and 'HOLD' keywords to be ignored.

OUTPUT command problem.
If you let the 'OUTPUT' command create the data set, it will
make the LRECL 132.  If the sysout data being retrieved by
the 'OUTPUT' command contains 133 byte records, a terrible
thing happens to the data - the first 132 bytes are written
to one record, and then the 133rd byte is written in a
second record, in column 1 (the carriage control position),
padded with 131 blanks.

If you retrieved data containing some 133 byte records and
some shorter records, there is no way, repeat no way for
this command or any other software to figure out which
of the 132 byte records are complete records and which are
segments of longer records.

If you dont zap the 'OUTPUT' command, and your data is 133
bytes long, you must pre-allocate the data set with an
attribute of LRECL(133) before using the 'OUTPUT' command
if you intend to print the data properly.

If an unqualified data set name is entered, the
catalog must be read twice, once to append a
trailing qualifier if necessary, and again during
allocation. The user can eliminate the first by using
the fully qualified name, prefix and all, in quotes,
or by entering all but the prefix, without quotes,
plus the keyword 'Q'. The latter is much simpler
and gives the same performance improvement as a
fully qualified name.

The 'FILE' keyword is useful for printing temporary
data sets.  It tells the command to treat the first
operand as a filename (DDNAME) instead of a dsname.
Whatever data set is currently allocated to the
filename will be printed (and quickly, because
the command doesnt have to allocate anything).

Note - if a non-existent member of a PDS is specified,
the command will abend with 013-18.
