.subsection 'Description'
.pp
This program is an ISPF program which reads ISPF variable DSNINFO
which must contain the name of a dataset whose attributes are being
investigated.  DSNINFO then allocates the dataset and extracts the
below listed attributes and updates the related ISPF variables with
those values.
.pp
This program was originally found on the CBT MVS Modifications Tape
file 300 and was extensively modified to function as an ISPF program.
It's original name was LISTSPC.
.pp
To invoke DSNINFO from a CLIST specify:
.br
.in +10
ISPEXEC SELECT PGM(DSNINFO) PARM(dsn-variable-name,vol-var-name)
.br
.in -10
.sp
The dsn-variable-name is the ISPF variable containing the DSN to be
interogated.
.sp
The vol-variable-name is the ISPF variable containing the volser on
which the dataset resides. (optional)

If a member name is specifed then the DSORG is set to PS and the
space calculations will reflect the space used for the entire PDS
and not for the specified member.
