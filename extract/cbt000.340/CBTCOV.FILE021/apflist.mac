     This program is designed to run under TSO or batch and will display
     or print all APF authorized libraries for this IPL.  Also displayed
     is the total number of libraries and the size of the table.

     Note : SYS1.LINKLIB And SYS1.SVCLIB are automatically added at IPL
            time.  The table is built by NIP module IEAVNPA5 which
            allows a maximum of 2040 bytes in the APF table.

     The JCL necessary to execute this code in batch is:

         // EXEC PGM=APFLIST
         //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=A

     To execute this program under TSO:

        $P APFLIST

     If you desire to run APFLIST under TSO and want the output sent to
     SYSPRINT you will need a parm of B.
