.ix 'STAE Exit Subroutine'
.pp
This is an estae exit which displays the abend completion
code, psw, and register contents, then continues termination.
.pp
The STAE$ macro, requiring absolutely no operands,
builds the parameter list to be passed to this exit,
loads this exit, and issues an estae svc, which will
cause this exit to gain control in the event of an abend.
.pp
As an option, a list of csect names and boundaries may be
passed to the exit. If the psw is within any of the bound-
aries, the offset of the psw address from the beginning of
the csect is displayed, and 12 bytes of storage at the psw
address minus 6 is dumped to show the failing instruction.
.sp
 The parameters passed are:
 (1) the address of an option field and a list of
     csect names and boundaries.
 (2) The address of a 256 byte workarea
.pp
The first word of the option field contains flag bits
for directing the messages via tput or wto.
.pp
The second word of the option field may optionally
contain routing and descriptor codes for messages.
.pp
The fifth word of the option field contains zero or
the address of a list of csect descriptors.
