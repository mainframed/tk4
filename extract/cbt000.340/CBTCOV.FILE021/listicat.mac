  Function     List the contents of an ICF catalog and selected
               DSCB and VVDS fields.

  Description  the UCBs of all online dasd volumes are located and
               an attempt is made to allocate SYS1.VVDS.Vvolser.
               If this works an ACB and RPL are generated and their
               addresses are saved in a lookup table.
               The BCS cluster is opened as a dataset and read
               sequentially. The BCS records are scanned for cell
               types and the following cells are listed:

                 nonvsam
                 cluster
                 index
                 data
                 aix
                 path
                 gdg base
                 gdg entry

               For nonvsam entries the FORMAT 1 and, if it exists the
               FORMAT 3, DSCB is "obtained" to determine if the
               object exists. if it does the lrecl, blksize and
               total tracks allocated are extracted.
               If the object is catalogued to volser "MIGRAT" the
               HSM migrationcontroldataset is opened (SYSUT2) and
               used instead of the vtoc.

               For data and index entries the VVDS of the volume in
               question, if available, is scanned to determine the
               lrecl, blksize and track allocation of the object.

  Input        The BCS of the ICF catalog to be listed.

  Output       Output consists of a listing of the catalog.


                    dsname - The name of the component being listed.
                         For gdg entries this is developed into the
                         format that would be in a format1 DSCB.

                    type - The type of the cell being listed.

                    volume - The volser of the volume to which the
                         object is cataloged. Filled in only for
                         nonvsam, data, index and gdg entries.

                    unit - The name of the unit to which the
                         object is cataloged. Filled in only for
                         nonvsam, data, index and gdg entries.

                    trks - The number of tracks allocated to a dasd
                         resident object. Left blank for cataloged,
                         non-existing and tape-resident objects.

                    blksz - The physical block size of the object.
                         left blank for cataloged,
                         non-existing and tape-resident objects.

                    lrecl - The logical record length of the object.
                         left blank for cataloged,
                         non-existing and tape-resident objects.


  Abend codes:

                    U0014 - BCS cluster failed to open.
                         error code in register 2.

                    U0015 - BCS get failed.

  Parameters   PARM=DUMP produces a hex-translated listing of
                         BCS and VVDS cells.

  Execution    DDnames

               STEPCAT  defines the ICF catalog to be listed.

               SYSUT1   defines the ICF catalog to be listed.

               SYSUT2   defines the HSM migrationcontroldataset.
                        if you don't have HSM this can be left out.

               SYSPRINT defines the report output listing data set.

               SYSLIST  defines the detail output listing data set.

  Example:

               //LCAT   EXEC  PGM=LISTICAT
               //SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=*
               //SYSLIST  DD  SYSOUT=*
               //STEPCAT  DD  DSN=ICF.CATALOG,DISP=SHR
               //SYSUT1   DD  DSN=ICF.CATALOG,DISP=SHR
               //SYSUT2   DD  DSN=HSM.MCDS,DISP=SHR
               //SYSUDUMP DD  SYSOUT=*
