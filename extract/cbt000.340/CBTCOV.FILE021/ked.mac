.sp 2
This is the KED command table command.

It will allow a user to invoke the ISPF Editor based on a
given ddname. A great deal of power may be found when using
this command in dialog writing. For example:

COMMAND ===> KED ISPPLIB

will bring up an MSL containing a list of datasets allocated
to ISPPLIB.  This function does not use the Library Access
Services available with Version 2 of ISPF. The facility limits
the ddname to 4 datasets. In the above example, If ISPPLIB is
allocated to only one dataset, the user would directly enter
edit on that dataset.

If the user desires, he can enter a member name with the
ddname. For example:

COMMAND ===> KED ISPPLIB(ISR@PRIM)

The above command scans the datasets allocated to ISPPLIB. If
the member ISR@PRIM exists in only one dataset, the user
enters edit directly on that dataset. If the member exists in
more than one dataset, an MSL of datasets is displayed. The
list of datasets displayed are only those datasets containing
the member.

The command also support PROFILE, MACRO and the keyword FIRST.
See the HELP member for more.
