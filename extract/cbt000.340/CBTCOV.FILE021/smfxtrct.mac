This program extracts data from the SMF raw tape and writes it to an
output dataset unchanged in format, using the same data set
characteristics as the SMF raw tape (i.e., RECFM=VBS LRECL=2048
BLKSIZE=2052).  This is achieved by copying the input DCB attributes
unless the output DCB attributes are to be different from input.  The
RDJFCB macro is used to determine if the pertinent characteristics such
as RECFM, LRECL and blocksize are different.  If they are different,
these values are copied into the output DCB instead of using the input
DCB values.

Effective with this version are several program improvements over
version 3; these are (1) improved parm field information decode to
handle more than one parameter in any order; (2) fix for error message
ISX001 for no control card or insufficient number of control cards and
(3) a user option to link to the sort program (ighrco00) by specifying
an option in the parm field.  When the sort option is specified the user
must supply the sort control cards behind the control card for SMFXTRCT
in the input stream.  An insufficient number of sort control cards will
cause an SMFXTRCT error, not a sort error (ISX001).

This program requires the following DD cards:
.sp
.fo off
SYSPRINT -- printed output data set
SYSIN    -- control card input
SYSUT1   -- input SMF dataset
SYSUT2   -- output extracted record dataset
.fo on
.sp
In addition, all necessary JCL for SORT should be
included if PARM=SORT will be specified.
