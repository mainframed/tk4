.ix Programs XCVOLIST
.subsection 'XCVOLIST Introduction'
This program will list the contents of a CVOL (OS format) CATALOG.
.pp
It is designed for MVS, but may be assembled for MVT by
specifying SYSPARM(MVT) which will suppress generation of 370
instructions & MVS-dependent code. The XF or H assembler
is required for assembly.
.subsection 'XCVOLIST Output'
Normal output is to SYSPRINT (FBA, 133 by x)
.pp
Some error conditions are shown on SYSERROR (FBA, 133 by x)
a machine-readable extract of the CATALOG may be written on
SYSUT2 (VB) which will include records for GDG indices.
.pp
Data sets, unused index levels and unused GDG indices
(other indices, aliases and CVOL ptrs will not be on SYSUT2)
it is recommended that SYSUT2 LRECL be at least 1500
control cards are on SYSIN (FBA, 80 by x)
control card data can start in col. 1 or later and must be
completed by col. 71 (No continuations)
.pp
One operand must be CATALOG= (MVS only), NODE= (MVS only), or
DD= (MVS or MVT). CATALOG=index where index is an alias for
an OS CVOL will list the indicated CVOL. NODE=index will list
entries starting 'index.' In the indicated CVOL. Index may be
multiple levels and can have intermediate levels omitted, I.E.
NODE=abc..Xyz will list datasets whose first level of qualifi-
cation is abc and whose third level of qualification is xyz,
any other levels of qualification may occur. NODE=..Xyz is
also valid with either the CATALOG= or DD= parameter. DD=ddname
will list the CVOL indicated by that DD card (this is the
operand for MVT), the dsname must be specified in the DD card
(usually SYSCTLG, but may be any dataset in CVOL format).
.pp
The options may follow the first operand and are separated from
it and each other by commas with a blank ending the options.
The first option is 'check' to read all CATALOG blocks and do
validity checking on the CATALOG, this should not be needed very
often (every few months) and more than doubles the excp count.
.pp
The second option is 'GDG=n' where is a 1-4 digit number giving
the maximum number of generations before GDG indices are listed
on SYSERROR (default is GDG=8). If GDG=255 is specified, no
indices will be listed for either excessive generation count
or because the generation index specifies 'NODELETE'.
.pp
The third option is 'NODE=index' where only 'index.' Data sets
are to be listed and the CATALOG was allocated with DD=ddname
CATALOG=index (where the two indices are different).
.pp
The fourth option is 'SEEK' and will do a SEEK analysis on the
CATALOG structure (or the part you are listing).
.pp
The fifth option is 'FH' which is the same as 'SEEK' but if
part of the CATALOG resides on the fixed head portion of a
3340 or 3350, any movement into that area is treated as a fixed
head SEEK SEEK, any movement out of the fixed head area is
calculated based on the last used cylinder.
.pp
The sixth through ninth options are 'CHKALL', 'CHKREAL',
'FIXALL' and 'FIXREAL', they either check or correct the
DSCB TTR's in the CATALOG. 'ALL' or 'REAL' refers to all
dasd or real (non-mss) dasd being checked. Checking mss
can be very slow due to the mount time.
.pp
The tenth option is 'EXIT=xxxxxxxx' where xxxxxxxx is a 1-8
character exit program name. This program receives control
whenever a data set entry is to be printed and its return
code tells whether to print the data set entry (zero) or
not (non-zero). The call parameters are the dataset name,
the device name of the first volume, the volume count
(halfword binary) and the volume information. Each volume
information entry is twelve bytes long and consists of the
device type (4 bytes), the volume serial (6 bytes) and the
tape file number (halfword binary). The file number is zero
for a dasd data set. If the DSN is blank, it is the end of
the CATALOG, do any final processing in your exit program.

Examples:
NODE=abc.Xyz  this will list entries starting abc.Xyz.
.sp
CATALOG=a,GDG=11  this will list the CATALOG containing index a
                  and GDGs with more than 11 data sets will
                  be listed on SYSERROR
.sp
DD=CVOL1,CHECK  this will list the CVOL described by DD CVOL1
                and check all CATALOG blocks
.sp
DD=CVOL1,NODE=a  as above but no checking and list a. Entries
.sp 2;.fo on;.pp
Under MVS this should be an authorized program
if it isn't authorized, it will not ENQ on the CATALOG(s)
and it will be swappable.

.subsection 'XCVOLIST Change History'
Written by Doug Mercer, Lockheed-California Company
November, 1976
.sp
Modified by Doug Mercer, November 1978, to allow multiple
levels of qualification in the NODE operand, to allow
larger CATALOGs to be listed and sundry other improvements.
.sp
Modified by Doug Mercer, December 1978, to check master
CATALOG pointers on top-level indices (MVS only).
.sp
Modified by Doug Mercer, February 1980, to print DSCB TTRs
and to evaluate the physical structure in terms of the
SEEKs required to locate each data set entry.
.sp
Modified by Doug Mercer, April 1980, to check DSCB TTRs
and (optionally) correct the bad or missing TTR's.
.sp
Modified by Doug Mercer, April 1980, to allow a
user exit program.
.sp
Modified by Doug Mercer, January 1981, to support
3380 disks.
.sp
Modified by Doug Mercer, June 1982, to issue OKSWAP
SYSEVENT at termination if DONTSWAP was issued.
.sp
Modified by Doug Mercer, July 1982, to correctly
process partial NODE searching when GDG indices
are crossed.
.sp
Modified by Doug Mercer, October 1982, to do CVOL
ENQs and deqs in the same way as CATALOG management
.sp
Modified December 1982 by Howard Dean to change print
subroutine to never skip lines by making count  of lines
before skip symbolic.
.sp
Modified December 1982 by Howard Dean to make number of
lines per page a symbolic parameter.
.sp
Modified December 1982 by Howard Dean to fix SNAPDUMP option
as follows:  ddnames can be SNAPDUMP,SYSUDUMP,SYSABEND. If
SNAPDUMP DCB cannot be opened, no dump takes place
.sp
Modified December 1982 by Howard Dean to add additional auth
checking for the SEEK,FH,CHK,and fix parameters which are
restricted operands.
.sp
Modified December 1982 by Howard Dean to fix zero DSCBTTRs
(not supplied) as well as incorrect DSCBTTRs.
