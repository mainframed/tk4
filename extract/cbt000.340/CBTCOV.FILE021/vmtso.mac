     To run TSO under VM :

     First start VTAM. (See VTAM under VM)

     Second issue S TSO


     After TSO starts, you should have the VTAM salutation on the
     terminal attached as D50, to LOGON enter YAVMTSO.

     After TSO is up issue EX 'AOST.CLIST(VMLOGON)' to set up
     the correct TSO Prefix.  See seperate documentation on VMLOGON
     in this document for further information.

     NOTE: The prefix of AVMTSO is required so that you can allocate
     datasets and use ISPF plus.

     Important NOTE:  You cannot access either your TSO or RAT volumes
     so if you want any of these datasets then copy them to a pack which
     is accessable from VM.


     and have fun.............


     NOTE: doing a #CP SAVESYS with NET active could cause problems
     when recovering due to changes in the VTAMLST.
