.subsection 'Function'
.sp 2
  The REVIEW command allows a data set to be examined at
  a 3270 terminal in full screen mode.
.sp 2
.subsection 'Syntax'
.sp 2
         REVIEW  'DSNAME'  UNIT('unit')  VOLUME('volume')
     or
         REVIEW  'filename'  FILE
  required - 'DSNAME' or 'filename'
  defaults - none
  alias    - rev
.sp 2
.subsection 'Operands'
.sp 2
  'DSNAME(member)' the data set to be examined.
  'Filename' - the DDNAME allocated to the data set to be examined.
  The first operand is assumed to be a DSNAME unless it us followed
  by the keyword 'file'.
.sp
  FILE     - this keyword indicates that the first operand is
             a filename, not a DSNAME.  This is useful for looking
             at a temporary data set or at concatenated libraries.
             A member name may be specified in the first operand
             after the DDNAME if the DDNAME is allocated to a
             PDS. This allows you to enter 'REVIEW SYSPROC(x) F'
             to look at member 'x' in whatever PDS is allocated to
             DDNAME 'SYSPROC'.
.sp
  VOLUME('volume') - for uncataloged data sets, the volume serial.
.sp
  UNIT('unit') - for uncataloged data sets, the unit type. This can
             be omitted if your session default unit is appropriate.
             This operand is ignored if volume is not specified.
.sp
.cp 9
  PFK      - this is not an operand, but a description of
             the program function keys used by this command.
             PFK1  - top     PFK2  - bottom     PFK3  - end
             PFK4  -         PFK5  - find       PFK6  -
             PFK7  - up      PFK8  - down       PFK9  - hex
             PFK10 - left    PFK11 - right      PFK12 -
             these can be changed using the PFKn subcommand, but
             the changes are in effect only until the command ends.
             Example: 'PFK6 right 1' would make PFK6 'right 1'.

.sp 2
    up     - scroll backwards a specified number of records.
             If no operand is specified, the 'range' value is
             used. This is displayed in the upper right corner.
    '-'    - Same as 'up'.
    Down   - scroll backwards a specified number of records.
             If no operand is specified, the 'range' value is
             used. This is displayed in the upper right corner.
    '+'    - Same as 'down'
    left   - scroll to the left a specified number of columns.
             If no operand is specified, 80 is used.
    '<'    - Same as 'left'
    right  - scroll to the right a specified number of columns.
             If no operand is specified, 80 is used.
    '>'    - Same as 'right'
    top    - scroll up to the first record.
    Bottom - scroll down to the last record.
    Bot    - same as 'bottom'.
    List   - display the specified record number.
             Relative record number only, not sequence numbers.
    Hex on - display the screen in hexadecimal.
    Hex off - display the screen in EBCDIC.
    Hex     - if hex currently on, turn it off. If off, turn it on.
    Find   - search forward until the specified string is found.
             String does not have to be in quotes unless it
             contains one or more imbedded blanks.
             String may be followed by a column number.
             If no operand, string from previous find is used.
    Caps   - display lower case data in caps.
    Asis   - display lower case data in lower case.
    Member - switch to a specified member within the same
             partitioned data set as the current member.
    PFKn   - set program function key 'n'.
    End    - end the command
    SMF ON - If SMF data is being examined, convert the record
             type, date, and time to understandable format.
    SMF OFF - undo SMF ON.
    SMF     - If SMF currently ON, turn it OFF. if OFF, turn it ON.
