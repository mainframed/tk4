.sp 2
         This macro will provide the day, date, and time from the
         time-of-day clock in Gregorian (English) format.

         If invoked without the optional 'NOGEN' keyword, the constants
         named below will be generated.  If the 'NOGEN' keyword is used,
         the user must provide this routine with addressability to them
         as pre-defined constants.

         DAY    DS   X      a binary number (hex) relative to the day of
                            the week as follows 0=Monday, 1=Tuesday,
                            2=Wednesday, 3=Thursday, 4=Friday,
                            5=Saturday, 6=Sunday

         DATE   DS   CL8    an eight character field containing the date
                            in mm/dd/yy format

         TIME   DS   CL8    an eight character field containing the time

.subsection 'Special note'

         Note that the caller must provide a register save area that
         begins on a doubleword boundary to be used as a work area by
         this routine (r-13 based).
