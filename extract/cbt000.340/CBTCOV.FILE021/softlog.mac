SOFTLOG is an ISPF application which provides a facility for examining a
data base of system software failures. The data base consists of
software, IPL, and EOD records extracted from SYS1.LOGREC. A 31 day
history is maintained.
.pp
Each software record documents a system abend and contains the SDWA
(System Diagnostic Work Area). Note that records are often created
without a corresponding system dump. A flag in the SDWA indicates
whether or not a system dump was requested.
.pp
SOFTLOG displays one line for each record in the data base. The entries
are sorted by date and time. This makes it easy to obtain a quick
overview of all problems which have occurred over a period of time.
.pp
In addition a record may be examined in detail. SOFTLOG will invoke EREP
for a selected record and display the output via ISPF Browse. You may
also print the output.
