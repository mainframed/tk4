.sp 2
This program converts a sequential data set of PDS members in 'IEBUPDTE'
format to a partitioned data set.
.sp
The IEBUPDTE utility program can do the same thing, but this program has
the following added capabilities:
   Stores SPF statistics in a member's directory entry
   if they are present on the './ ADD' statement,
   Can generate SPF statistics if none are present,
   Can select one member from input file,
   Restores modified IEBUPDTE statements within a member
   (changes '/.' Back to './').
   Does not list the data in the member,
   Prints number of records for each member written.
.sp
If PARM='UPDTE(xx)' is specified, then all occurrences of the 2
characters in parentheses will be changed to './' Before being written
to the PDS, if they occur in columns 1-2 of the data.  This is used in
conjunction with another program which creates IEBUPDTE-format data sets
from a PDS, and in so doing changes all occurrences of './' In columns
1-2 of the data within the members to another constant, so IEBUPDTE and
this program will not treat the data records as control cards.  IEBUPDTE
doesn't change the data back. This program does.
.sp
The only IEBUPDTE control statements that are acceptable are the ./ ADD
statement and the ./ ALIAS statement.  The 'NAME=' operand must be
specified as the first or second operand (sometimes SSI= is specified
first).  Any other IEBUPDTE operand (except SSI=) is invalid and will
prevent subsequent operands from being processed.

These ADD statements will be processed correctly -
  ./ ADD NAME=XYZ
  ./ ADD NAME=XYZ,SSI=0012C06A
  ./ ADD SSI=1234ABCD,NAME=XYZ

In order for SPF statistics to be stored, the './ ADD'
statement must look like this:

   Col     description
   1-20    ./ ADD NAME=xxxxxxxx
   21      blank
   22-71   vvmm-yyddd-yyddd-hhmm-nnnnn-nnnnn-nnnnn-uuuuuuuuuu
           VER CREATE LASTMODIFY  SIZE  INIT   MOD   ID
.sp
The 'LISTPDS' utility program (from nasa goddard) has been locally
modified to punch an IEBUPDTE deck with SPF statistics in the above
format. It does not punch  ./ ALIAS statements, however.
.sp
The SPF data is in the 'comments' area of the statement so the input
could be run thru 'IEBUPDTE' successfully.  It would just ignore the SPF
data.
.sp
The format of the 50-byte SPF field is fixed. Each value must have the
correct number of digits (use leading zeroes if necessary). Only the
10-byte 'id' field at the end may have a variable length. No imbedded
blanks allowed.  Values must be separated by a hypen as above. If the
data does not conform to these rules, the member will still be written
but without SPF statistics.
.sp
Input (SYSUT1) DCB attributes need not be specified if the file has
standard labels. If it is an unlabeled tape, only the BLKSIZE need be
specified (if it is not 80).
.sp
If the output file does not have attributes in its label and none are
specified in the SYSUT2 DD statement, the program will set them to
LRECL=80, BLKSIZE=3120.
