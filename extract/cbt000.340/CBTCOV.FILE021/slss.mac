An ISPF CLIST application has been developed to aid the individual
in controlling his personal SLSS.  This application may be entered via
the main AOST ISPF panel or by executing clist SLSS.
.pp
Note that inorder to make use of this function you MUST have
preallocated an ISPF Table dataset and specified the option TABL(dsn)
in the AOSTISPF exexution CLIST.
.pp
The dsn may be whatever is meaningful to you.  A sample TSO ALLOC
might be:

     ATTR xxx BLKSIZE(6160) LRECL(80) RECFM(F B)
     ALLOC DA(dsn) USI(xxx) SPA(1,1) TR NEW
     FREE DA(dsn xxx)
.pp
A sample SLSS of approx. 80 manuals has been provided which you
will get on your first invokation of SLSS.  ADD, DELETE or CHANGE any
manuals that you need to and then save it (PF3/PF15 also = SAVE).
From then on you will get your copy of the SLSS table.
