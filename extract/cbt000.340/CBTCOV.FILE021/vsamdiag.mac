.subsection 'Description'


     This program is IBM property and is internal use only.
     VSAMDIAG is not supported, but any problem encountered will
     will be looked at on a best effort basis. Please submit the
     portable failing data set to: VSAM ct.  Attn. Jerry Grey.
     The install deck contains the object deck for VSAMDIAG and
     the necessary linkage editor control cards to link VSAMDIAG
     into SYS1.LINKLIB With authorization.

     VSAMDIAG is a field developed VSAM data set diagnostic
     program. It is mainly designed to examine separatly the index
     component and the data component of a VSAM KSDS.
     Examination of the index component is mainly done by a
     cross-checking of the vertical and horizontal pointers in
     the index CI's and further checking the whole data component
     described by the indexes.
     Examination of the data component is done by logical sequential
     reading of all the data CI's allocated, even for FREE space CI's.
     Record is checked, as well as key sequence and FREE space good
     erasure. Update integrity of spanned records is also checked.
     VSAMDIAG Does not modify anything in the data set, but only
     indicates if there is a data integrity problem, and what is
     wrong in that case.
     VSAMDIAG Can also search through the indexes to retrieve the
     CI of each level in which a key given as an argument should be.
     This is accomplished by horizontal scanning of the index, and
     is complimentary of other usual get direct methods. You can
     also retrieve the data CI that should containe the given key.


.subsection 'Index tests'

     1-High level index not unique
     2-horizontal pointer pointing to itself
     3-index levels intermixed
     4-missing CI in horizontal chain
     5-missing vertical pointer(s)
     6-long loop in horizontal chain
     7-duplicate vertical pointer
     8-duplicate base RBA in sequence set
     9-duplicate keys in the indexes
     10-out-of-sequence keys in the indexes
     11-seof inside the index component
     12-data CI not described by indexes
     13-bad high level index RBA
     14-bad first sequence set index RBA value
     15-incorrect high used RBA in data
     16-incorrect high used RBA in index
     17-inconsistent extent allocation
     18-loss of a CI in the index
     19-loss of a ca in the data
     20-horizontal chain broken in any index level
     21-incorrect base RBA in t the seqeunce set
     22-too many pointers in the sequence set

        Running on a model 168 UP, the index test takes less
      two minutes elapsed time for a KSDS with about 50,000
      data CIs. (ie: one million 200 byte records)

.subsection 'Data tests'

     1-Inconsistent cidf in a FREE space CI
     2-seof in a FREE space CI
     3-FREE space CI not EMPTY
     4-some rdf errors
     5-data CI overflow
     6-update failure in segments of a spanned record
     7-incomplete spanned record
     8-incorrect key sequence
     9-seof in a data CI
     10-record longer than maximum record length
     11-missing ending seof
     12-some data in a FREE space CI
       as the data tests must read all the data CI's, it uses
     asynchronous processing to optimize its performance. You can
     specify, in the SYSIN ddcard, the number of buffers that you
     wish in order to obtain the best pass time. The default value
     of three should be good in most cases. Note, too many buffers
     may result in excessive pagination.


        To estimate the necessary time to run the data test,
      get the hurba(high used RBA) and the data cisize from
      the catalog for the data set to test:

         Elapsed time = (hurba * 0.03) / Cisize
         (in seconds)
       for a full 3330, cisize = 1024, about one hour.

                        debug...-Dump at index test termination
                        indxtest-to execute the index tests
                        datatest-to execute the data tests
                        nbuff=nn-to specify the number of buffers
                                 for data test.(01 To 99)
                        key= dcx(...)
                             Dcc(...) To search a key (if datatest)
                                      or SNAP all index levels
                                      crossed(if indxtest)
         if SYSIN not specified, the default test options are:
                  --nodebug  nosnap  nodatatest indxtest  nbuff=3

       Keywords are not positional. There are no restriction on
     the number of SYSIN cards. For key = parameter, field dcx(...)
     Defines a hex field in the key and must not exceed 14 digits,
     with an even number of digits. Field dcc(...) Defines a
     character field in the key.

       Key fields can be concatinated on several SYSIN cards. Each
     card containing a portion of the key must begin with key =.
     Length of the key searched is the total length of the key
     fields. Maximum length is 256.

       Example SYSIN card:
         //SYSIN DD *
           SNAP  Indxtest key= dcx(03274c)
           key= dcc(abcdef)  dcc(ghi) dcx(ff0011)
           key= dcc(jkl   mn)       debug
        options in effect:
               SNAP   indxtest   debug

        The key searched for is:
           03274cc1c2c3c4c5c6c7c8c9ff0011d1d2d3404040d4d5
         with a key length of 23.

         Note: if the key used as the argument is to be compared
               with longer keys, it is rear padded with ffff.


.subsection 'Messages and codes'

     001 ... Ds tested is not a KSDS
         attempted to run VSAMDIAG on a non-ksds file.

     002 ... Ds was not closed - left open -
         VSAMDIAG found that the cluster was not properly closed.
         The only test done is on the ardb chain, and the cluster
         is left open.

     003 ... Ds was not closed - was in create mode
         VSAMDIAG found that the cluster was not properly closed,
         and was in load/create mode. In this case verify will only
         set the high used RBA to zero. The cluster must be recreated.

     004 ... Data comp contains nn% FREE CI reusable
         this message will appear when there is no severe error. It
         gives the percentage of FREE space in the data component.

     005 ... ** Index integrity problem detected **
         VSAMDIAG detected an error in the index component. There
         could be an exposure to lose data if using standard
         recovery procedures or verify. Indexes must be examined
         with the help of the concurrent msg 00i, before using the
         cluster. Save the cluster via IEHDASDR if possible.

     006 ... ** No error detected in indexes **
         it's ok, but don't forget datatest .. If you doubt

     007 ... GETMAIN Error rc nnnn
         VSAMDIAG unable to obtain storage for lvlwas. The data set
         is probably too large for the region specified. Increase
         region size or examine the return code nnnn(getmain R15)

     008 ... ** Warning ** save ds via IEHDASDR before any use
         ...Do not run verify
         please, do it.

     009 ... ** Severe error; no further process done **
         VSAMDIAG encountered a severe error and could not continue
         testing. Abend code is u002. Look first in msg log for a
         possible open return code from VSAM. If not, this message
         must be proceded by msg 00i.

     010 ... ** No error detected in data **
         VSAMDIAG did not detect any errors in the data component.

     011 ... Data comp contains nnnnnnnn records
         all these records contain valid and in-sequence keys.

     012 ... Data comp contains nnnnnnnn deleted CI(s)
         the count of CI's in which all records have been deleted.
         These CI's are not available as FREE space, and will only
         be reused if records inserted contain keys that are in
         the old range of keys for that CI.

     013 ... ** Data integrity problem detected **
         VSAMDIAG detected an error in the data component.
         There is an exposure to lose data if using standard
         recovery procedures. You should print the entire ca
         in error before modifying the data set.

     014 ... Probable loop in horizontal pointers
         ... Run index test
         VSAMDIAG is protected against possible horizontal pointer
         loop in the sequence set when running datatest. You should
         run indxtest prior to datatest.

     015 ... Seof inside sequence set - run index test
         while running datatest, VSAMDIAG encountered an unexpected
         seof in the sequence set. Indxtest should be run prior to
         to datatest. The diagnostic will be more accurate.

     016 ... Key seacrh ok * ssrba n/a * cirba n *
         the key passed via SYSIN has been found. N is the RBA of
         the data CI containing the record. If you gave a SNAP DD,
         this CI is snapped.

     00D ... Error code nn * ssrba n1 * cirba n2 *
         VSAMDIAG detected an error in data component checking.
         Field n1 is the RBA of the sequence set index CI, and
         field n2 is the RBA of the current data CI. See nn error
         code in the table below.

     100 ... ** Rec management error - rpl fdbk = nnnnnn
         there was a bad return code on a getix macro. If you
         ran with the debug option you may find why you got the
         nnnnnn return code in the rpl.

     00I ... Error code nn * cin/i-rba n1 lvl n2 * cin/-rba n3
         ... Lvl n4 * RBA n5 * RBA n6
         VSAMDIAG detected an error in cross testing the indexes.
         Fields n1,n2,n3,n4,n5,n6, varies upon the error code and
         are explained in the table below.

         Error code table for message 00i:
      x after the error code indicates a severe error, and VSAMDIAG
      terminates testing.

      N1,n3 are the CI number and RBA in hex.
      N2,n4 are the index levels.
      N5,n6 are the RBA in hex.

.subsection 'Data areas'


    CI Buffers:
              gotten via SNAP DD card. They are automatically
              dumped when an erro is found on a CI (with msg
              00i or 00d where the RBA is given).

              Displacements in hex:

         '00'... Next buffer pointer
         '04'... CI Number in hex
         '08'... Corresponding RBA in hex
         '0c'... Rpl address (only for data CI buffers)
         '20'... Beginning of CI


    Lvlwa:
              one per level of index. Only for index test.
              The lvlwa contains the tables for horizontal
              pointers, base rbas, and vertical pointers.
              Gotten via the SNAP parameter in SYSIN and
              providing a SNAP DD card.

              Displacements in hex:

         '00'... Lwanxt............Ptr to next lvlwa
         '04'... Lwaprv............Ptr to previous lvlwa
         '08'... Lwaflg............Flags
         '--'... Lwaswks..X'80'....Switch for key searching
         '--'... Lwafil...X'40'....First index in level
         '09'... Lwalvl............Index level(one byte)
         '0c'... Lwall.............Length of lvlwa
         '10'... Title.............'Index level n '
         '20'... Lwahhn............Title ' hhn '
         '24'... Lwahhf............Pointer to first hhp
         '28'... Lwahhsp...........Scan ptr for hhps
         '2c'... Lwahhl............Pointer to last hhp
         '30'... Lwahhe............Pointer to end of hhp area
         '34'... Lwahhct...........Count of hhps
         '40'... Lwaixn............Title 'ixn'
         '44'... Lwaixf............Pointer to fisrt ixp
         '48'... Lwaixsp...........Scan ptr for ixps
         '4c'... Lwaixl............Pointer to last ixp
         '50'... Lwaixe............Pointer to end of ixp area
         '54'... Lwaixpct..........Count of ixps
         '60'... Lwabrn............Title 'brba'
         '64'... Lwabrf............Pointer to first brba
         '68'... Lwabrsp...........Scan pointer for brbas
         '6c'... Lwabrl............Pointer to last brba
         '70'... Lwabre............Pointer to end of brba area
         '74'... Lwabrct...........Count of brbas
         '78'... Lwabrgr...........Largest brba found
         '80'... Lwacrba...........Current RBA
         '84'... Lwafcct...........Count of FREE cis in seq set
         '88'... Lwafccu...........Count of FREE cis in data


    Ixpwa:
            filled with vertical pointers for each sequence set CI.
            Used only in data test.

            Displacements in hex:
         '00'... Ixpll.............Length of ixpwa
         '04'... Ixpt..............Title ' ixp '

         '0c'... Ixpsp.............Scan pointer to ixps
         '10'... Ixpl..............Pointer to last ixp
         '14'... Ixpbrba...........Current base RBA
         '20'... Ixpixp............Beginning of ixp entries
         dlmtr equ x'ffffffff'  delimiter between FREE space
                                entries and data CI entries.
