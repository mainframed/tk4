Compare Two Versions of an Assembler Language Module
.sp 2
Function:
.sp
COMPASM compares two versions of an assembly language source module. It
is especially well suited to cases where the two versions differ
significantly. The content of the source code is used to make an
intelligent comparison. Sequence numbers are not normally used. The
differences between the two modules are printed and/or punched as an
update deck.  Statistics on the extent of the differences are also
printed.
.sp 2
Parameters:
.sp
All parameters are optional.  Parameters are specified as
PARM='PLIPARMS/PGMPARMS'.  PGMPARMS must be preceded by a "/".

PLIPARMS:
ISASIZE(amount) (default ISASIZE(500K))
    ISASIZE specifies the initial storage area obtained by PLI.
    Performance is improved slightly if a large enough value is
    specified. It may be calculated as 164*SIZE+4500 (see
    PGMPARM SIZE).

PGMPARMS:
COLUMN=column-number (default COLUMN=72)
    COLUMN specifies the number of columns used for comparison.
DECK×NODECK (default NODECK)
    DECK specifies that an update deck is to be written to file
    SYSPUNCH.
FORMAT=<SMP×UPDATE> (default FORMAT=SMP)
    SMP specifies that the deck is to be in SMP format. UPDATE
    specifies that the deck is to be in IEBUPDTE format.
INCR=sequence-increment (default INCR=10)
    INCR specifies the interval between sequence numbers for
    inserted cards written to SYSPUNCH.
LINECOUNT=page-SIZE (default LINECOUNT=55)
    LINECOUNT specifies the number of lines per page on
    SYSPRINT and SYSTERM.
LIST×NOLIST×LIST=ALL (default LIST)
    LIST specifies that a report of module differences is to
    written to SYSPRINT. LIST=ALL specifies that the listing
    will include cards which are the same in both modules.
MODID=modification-id (default MODID=        )
    MODID specifies a character string which will be punched in
    columns 64-71 of comments cards used for deletion when
    FORMAT=SMP is specified.
SEQFLD=ccl (default SEQFLD=738)
    SEQFLD is used when a portion of the sequence field in
    columns 73-80 is non-numeric.  'ccl' specifies the COLUMN
    (cc) and length (l) of the numeric portion of the sequence
    field.
SIZE=module-SIZE (default SIZE=3000)
    SIZE specifies the number of cards in the larger module.
TERM×NOTERM (default NOTERM)
    TERM specifies that statistics and error messages will be
    written to file SYSTERM.

.sp 2
Input files:
.sp
All input files must be sequential or a member of a partitioned data and
must be RECFM=FB, LRECL=80.
.sp;.fo off
OLD (required)
   OLD is the "original" version of the module.
NEW (required)
   NEW is the "modified" version of the module.
SYSIN (optional)
   SYSIN is used when DECK is specified. It is copied to the
   beginning of SYSPUNCH. If SYSIN is omitted, an UPDATE
   ./ CHANGE NAME=module-name card is punched.
.sp 2
Output files:
.sp
SYSPRINT (required)
   SYSPRINT is a report of module differences and statistics.  Added
   cards are flagged with +++, and deleted cards are flagged with ---.
   It must be RECFM=VBA, LRECL=125.
SYSTERM (optional)
   SYSTERM is used when TERM is specified. It is a subset of SYSPRINT
   for TSO terminal use. It contains just statistics and error messages.
   It must be RECFM=VBA, LRECL=125.
SYSPUNCH (optional)
   SYSPUNCH is used when DECK is specified. It is an update deck in SMP
   or IEBUPDTE format which converts the "old" module into the "new"
   module. It must be RECFM=FB, LRECL=80.
.sp 2;.fo on
Method of operation:
.sp
Both modules are read into arrays in main storage. The program
then builds cross-reference arrays which point to matching
cards in the two modules. Multiple passes are made over the
source text. The first pass compares cards which are most
likely to be unique. Each subseqent pass compares cards which
are progressively less likely to be unique.

The first pass identifies source macros and open code. Each
macro is compared separately. Each matching macro or open code
is scanned for cards with sequence symbols. Then between
matching sequence symbols, cards are scanned for names. Cards
between matching names are scanned for non-trivial cards.
Finally trivial cards are compared between matching non-trivial
cards.  Trivial cards are either comments with simple patterns
of repeated characters or assembler control statements such as
EJECT or SPACE.

A report and/or deck are then produced using the
cross-reference arrays. Statistics are printed on the results
of the comparison.
