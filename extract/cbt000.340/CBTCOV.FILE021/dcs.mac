          This macro is used for coding a fullscreen 3270 display.

          It simplifies the coding of a screen in the following ways.
          .  Buffer addresses are specified as row and column number.
             The macro translates them into the 3270 code.
          .  Orders are specified by name, such as 'SBA' and 'SF', so
             you do not have to know the hex codes for them.
          .  Commonly used attribute bytes are specified by name (a set
             of reserved names) so you do not have to know the hex codes
             for them.
          .  It saves a lot of documentation work, and makes the code
             easier for others to understand.

          The user of the macro must still understand how a screen is
          constructed before using it.  The macro merely makes it easier
          to specify the values.  It does very little error checking.
          For instance, it does not check to see if you follow an 'SBA'
          with a buffer address.  It is possible to code a thoroughly
          invalid screen.

          The macro may have any number of operands, consisting of
          any combination of the following.

          .  An order.
             Valid orders are:
             SBA           set buffer address
             SF            start field
             RTA           repeat to address
             IC            insert cursor
             PT            program tab
             EUA           erase unprotected to address
          .  A buffer address in parentheses.
             If an operand is in parentheses, it is assumed that the row
             and column number are between the parens, separated by a
             comma.  Example: (1,1) This form of buffer address is new
             as of March 18 1982.
          .  A row or column number of a buffer address (old format).
             If an operand is numeric, it is assumed to be
             a row or column number.  It takes 2 operands to
             specify the buffer address (row and column) so numeric
             operands must always be specified in pairs, the
             first being the row and the second being the column.
             This format is supported only for compatibility with
             the original version of this macro.
          .  An attribute byte.
             Valid attribute bytes are:
             UNPLO -  unprotected normal intensity
             UNPHI  - unprotected high intensity
             UNPNP  - unprotected no-display
             PROLO  - protected normal intensity
             PROLOS - protected normal intensity auto-skip
             PROHI  - protected high intensity
             PROHIS - protected high intensity auto-skip
          .  A hex, character, or address constant.
             For example, x'00', or c'enter signon'
             This can be used for data within fields or for
             attribute bytes, orders, the 'WCC', or buffer
             addresses (if you want to figure them out).

          If the operands do not all fit on one line, you can either
          continue the line in the standard assembler way or code the
          macro again on the next line with the remaining operands.  The
          result is the same either way.

          The buffer address conversions are for a screen size of 24
          rows by 80 columns. For screens of other dimensions
          43 bu 80, 12 by 40) the macro needs only a few changes.

          Warning: if you code the macro with a label in column 1, and
          you like using length attributes, beware that the length
          attribute of the label is not necessarily the total length of
          the data generated by the macro.
