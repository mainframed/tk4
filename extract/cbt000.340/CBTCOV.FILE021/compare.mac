.sp 1
.pp
This program is used to compare two versions of the same source
program.  It will compare columns 1 through 72 or optionally columns
1 through 80.  The optional file, IGNORE, may be used to instruct
COMPARE to ignore specified card images in the data sets being
compared.  A report of the comparison is written to the SYSPRINT
file.  If the output is directed to a TSO terminal, only the first
78 characters of each line are written.  This may not be desirable
if you are using a hard-copy terminal.
.pp
The COMPARE program uses only columns 1 through 72; thus, any
two versions of a program may be easily compared even if one
(or both) of the files has been resequenced.  If neither file
has been resequenced, a PARM of "FULL" may be coded to request
that all eighty columns be used in the comparison.  A facility
is also provided to ignore trivial card images (such as " EJECT "
or " SPACE 3 " in an assembler source program).
.pp
This program uses all available core in its region after opening
its input/output files (except for 4k which is released).  The
obtained core area is used as a compare buffer which is only
dumped (written to SYSPRINT) when identical records (based on
the first 72 bytes) are found in the old and new data sets.  If
the compare buffer overflows, the program terminates.  Therefore,
if it is suspected that the two data sets may be very far out of
sync, a large region should be used.  The number of unmatched
records that can be buffered at one time can be calculated from
the expression:  (region size - 8k - buffers) / 160
as a general rule, 30k is sufficient for about 100 unmatched
records at a time, and 100k is sufficient for about 500 unmatched
records at a time.
.pp
Card images of the trival data is input from the IGNORE file.  If
the IGNORE DD statement is missing, a table of trivial data for
assembler source code will be assumed which includes " EJECT ", "
SPACE   " " SPACE 1 ", " SPACE 2 ", " SPACE 3 " and blank comment
cards.

.subsection 'History'
.pp
This COMPARE program originated at YALE University and was obtained
from the Connecticut Bank and Trust Company mods tape (file 226) The
program format on the CBT mods tape was disassembled source; it was
recommented, resymbolized, redocumented and slightly modified by  A.
