.subsection 'Notes on Usage'
.sp
The use of the @ character for run-time values is stressed.
.sp
The dynamic  allocation macros will  take addresses of  values not
known at assembly  time.  to indicate that  an operand of a  DDD or
FREEDD macro is an address of a value rather than a value itself, add
the character '@' to the end of an RX-type address in the operand.
.sp
The DCB=BUFNO keyword,  the DCB=KEYLEN keyword,  the first or only
subparameter  of  the   COPIES  keyword,   and  the   VOLUME  count
subparameter of the  VOLUME keyword of the DDD macro  are no longer
limited to values less than 128.
.sp
The DDD  macro supports the following  operands which may  be used
only    when   executing    under    MVS/XA:    BURST=,     CHARS=,
COPIES=(,(group,values)), FLASH=, MODIFY=, UNIT=(,,DEFER).
.sp
The default  error exit  has been  changed to  invoke IKJEFF18  to
write a WTO describing the error.
.sp
The  macros will  work  in 31-bit  addressing  mode under  MVS/XA.
(since IKJEFT18  operates in 24-bit  addressing mode,   the default
error  exit routine  should  not be  used if  the  literal pool  or
working storage are above the 16 megabyte line.)
.sp
The use of '@' for specifying text unit parameter values not known
at assembly time is now documented.
.sp
The KEYADDS keyword  of the DDD,  DDI and FREEDD macros will accept
addresses of fullwords pointing to text units.
.sp 2
.subsection Function
.sp
The dynamic allocation macros (DDD, FREEDD, CONCAT, DDDD, DDTU)
construct the  request block  and text  UNIT address  list for
dynamic allocation, issue the "dynalloc macro" (SVC 99),  test
the return code,   and if it is  not 0,  abend or  branch to a
user-specified recovery routine.
.sp
 The dynamic  allocation macros perform  "dynamic allocation",
"dynamic unallocation" and "dynamic concatenation".
.sp
Those operands of the macros that have equivalents in the JCL
DD statement may all be coded the  same way as they are in JCL
(with a few exceptions noted in this manual).   those operands
that specify  numeric  values  may  also   be  coded  as  non-
relocatable assembler expressions.
.sp
As  support  for text  UNIT  parameter  values not  known  at
assembly  time,  any  operand  whose  corresponding text  UNIT
contains a  parameter value  (with a  few exceptions  noted in
this manual)   may be coded  as an RX-type  address expression
followed by the character '@'.  the RX-type address must point
to storage  containing the  value to be  placed into  the text
UNIT for that operand.  values for operands of varying lengths
must  be padded  to the  maximum length  allowed.  the  macros
supply the text unit key, number and length.
.sp
They use  global symbols  to determine the  length of  a work
area and whether certain features have been used.
.sp
Full documentation on  the use of dynamic  allocation and SVC
99 is  in os/vs2 system  programming library:   job management
(gc28-0627-1)  or  MVS/XA system programming  library:  system
macros and facilities (gc28-1150-1).   JCL reference is os/vs2
MVS JCL (gc28-0692-3).
.sp
Example:  allocate DDNAME sysut1 to a dataset whose name will
not be known until run time.
.sp
.fo off
* ALLOCATE THE DATASET WHOSE NAME IS IN THE 44 BYTES FROM MYWORK+16
*  THRU MYWORK+59 WITH MEMBER NAME IN THE 8 BYTES BEGINING 2 BYTES
*  AFTER THE ADDRESS CONTAINED IN GENERAL REGISTER RN.

.subsection 'DDD Macro'
.sp 2
DDD (dynamic data definition) - perform dynamic allocation
.sp
The  DDD  macro,   modeled  after   the  JCL  DD  statement,
constructs a text  UNIT list and calls a subroutine  (in the DDDD
macro expansion)   to issue SVC  99.  if  DDD is issued  during a
concatenation it also constructs part  of a dynamic concatenation
text unit. the DDD macro expansion contains only executable code.
.sp 2
.us Syntax:
.sp;.fo off
  name              'return' coded as the name indicates a
                    request for the return of the DDNAME (see
                    below).  any other value is interpreted
                    as a DDNAME specification exactly as in
                    JCL.
.sp
  DDD               preceded and followed by at least one blank.
.sp
     dummy          positional parameter, optional.  If
                    used, must be coded as shown.  indicates
                    allocation of a dummy dataset, exactly as
                    in JCL.
.sp
     keywords:       optional. Use keywords to indicate
                    specifics of the allocation.
.sp;.fo on
The keyword operands of DDD may be coded, for the most part,  as if they
were keywords of the  JCL DD statement.   the DDD operands values are
not always known at assembly time and for this  reason,   DDD  accepts
addresses  of  dynamic allocation
.sp
DDD supports  the  following keywords  (with  noted  exceptions) exactly
         as in JCL:
.fo off
       DISP=  (exception:   dynamic  allocation does  not  support
                passed  datasets (DISP=(,PASS) or DISP=(,,PASS)))

                specified as an RX-type  address followed by '@', only
                one character  arrangement table  name may  be specified
       COPIES= (group values  for the  3800 printer  for execution only.

DDD supports the following keywords with limited function:
.sp 2;.fo off
       DSN=,DSNAME=   (exception:   dynamic  allocation  does  not
              support an area  name for an isam  dataset or DSNAME
              specification by reference to a DDNAME (DSN=*. ))
          DDD does  not  support  the   single-ampersand  form  of
              DSN=,DSNAME=  for system-named  temporary  datasets.
              use the double-ampersand form.
          if a member name is desired,  specify  it as in JCL,  in
              parentheses after the DSNAME. the actual member name
              may be specified,  if known at assembly time,  or an
              RX-type address expression followed  by '@' may give
              the address of an 8-byte field where the member name
              may be found (padded with blanks) at run time.
       DCB=  (exception:   dynamic allocation does not support DCB
              reference  to a  DDNAME in  a previous  job step  or
              DCB=CYLOFL= or DCB=NTM=)
               DDD supports DCB  reference to a  cataloged dataset
                   or DCB reference  to a DDNAME in  this job step
                   exactly as in JCL.

.sp 2
DDD has limited  support for  the  following DCB  sub- keyword:
.sp
                 DSORG=   for da, po or ps only.
.sp 2
DDD does not support the following DCB sub-keywords:
.sp
                 BFALN=,   BFTEK=,   BUFIN=,   BUFMAX=,   BUFOFF=,

DDD does not  support the  following DCB  sub-keywords that have no JCL
                counterparts:
.sp
                 BUFRQ=, IPLTXTID=, SOWA=.
.sp 2
Dynamic allocation does not support the following keywords:
.sp
            AMP=, CHKPT=EOV, DDNAME=, DLM=, DSID=.
.sp 2
DDD supports the following keywords not in JCL:
.sp
       TYPE=PERM  specifies the permanently allocated attribute.
       TYPE=CNVRT  specifies   the  convertible   and  permanently
       allocated attributes.
       TYPE=TEMP  specifies neither attribute.
          default: TYPE=PERM, as used by the ALLOC command.
.sp
       MOUNT=YES   specifies  that dynamic  allocation  may  bring
       devices  online  and  mount  volumes  for  this  allocation
       (unless  issued   by  time   sharing  user   without  mount
       authority).
.sp
       MOUNT=NO    specifies that  dynamic  allocation  is not  to
       bring devices online or mount volumes for this allocation.
          default: MOUNT=NO
0      KEYADDS=   specifies  1  or   more  RX-type  addresses  (or
       register numbers enclosed in parentheses)  of user-supplied
       text units to be included with  the text units generated by
       the DDD  macro.  DDD does  not initialize or  inspect these
       text units.   an  RX-type address not followed by  a '@' is
       the address of a text unit.  an RX-type address followed by
       a '@' is  the address of a fullword  containing the address
       of a text unit.   a register (enclosed in parentheses) must
       contain the address of a text unit and must not be followed
       by a '@'.
          default: none.
       EXIT=      specifies an  RX-type address  of or  (register)
       containing the  address of  a user  error-handling routine.
       code in the  DDDD macro will branch to this  routine if the
       return code from dynamic allocation is not 0.  registers on
       entry to the error-handling routine are:
                register 14  - return address to  resume execution
                as if the return code from SVC 99 had been 0.   if
                the DDD macro was not part of a concatenation this
                will be the address of the first instruction after
                the DDD macro.
                register  15  -  address   of  the  error-handling
                routine.
                register 0  - contents of  register 15 as returned
                by SVC 99.
                register  1  -  same  as when  SVC  99 was  issued
                (points to a fullword that contains the address of
                the dynamic allocation request block).
                registers 2 thru 13 -  unchanged from entry to the
          default:  a routine internal to  the macros that invokes
       IKJEFF18  to issue  a  diagnostic  WTO,  and  issues  abend
       specifying user abend  code 99 with dump.   ALODFAIL is the
       label  of   the  default  error-handling  routine   in  the
       expansion of  the DDDD  macro (code).   your error-handling
       routine  may exit  to the  default error-handling  routine,
       which will  issue a diagnostic WTO  and abend user  99,  by
       branching to the label ALODFAIL.
.sp
       NOTE: the ALODFAIL routine is generated as part of the DDDD
       code expansion only  if some previous DDD,   FREEDD or CONCAT
       macro left the exit=  parameter unspecified.  if necessary,
       code a parameterless DDD macro and  ORG back over it before
       the DDDD code macro.
.sp 2
NOTES:
.sp
       To request the return of the  DDNAME,  code 'RETURN' as the
           DDNAME.   when 'RETURN' is specified  in the label of a
           DDD  macro,  DDD  does not  use  it as  the DDNAME  but
           instead includes a text unit  for return of the DDNAME.
           the label on the text unit  for return of the DDNAME is
           always  'ALORTDDN'.     after  the  DDD   is  executed,
           ALORTDDN+4 contains the halfword length of the returned
           DDNAME  and  ALORTDDN+6 contains  the  returned  DDNAME
           left-justified and padded with blanks to length 8.
.sp
       DDD supports  quoted   operands  only  for   the  subsystem
           parameters portion of the  SUBSYS=  keyword.
.sp
       The expansion of the DDD macro  does not include any label.
           to branch to the DDD macro,  branch to a labeled  DS 0H
            before it.
.sp
       Addressability: the literal pool and the DDDD macro must be
           addressable from every DDD macro. if there are two DDDD
           macros  (code   and  storage),    then  both   must  be
           addressable from every DDD macro.

.sp 2
The FREEDD macro performs dynamic deallocation. it constructs a  text

       SYSOUT= specifies an  overriding SYSOUT class for  a SYSOUT
           dataset.
.sp
       HOLD=YES  specifies  hold  queue processing  for  a  SYSOUT
           dataset.
       HOLD=NO overrides a HOLD=YES on the original allocation.
.sp
       DEST=  specifies an  overriding  remote  workstation for  a
           SYSOUT dataset.
FREEDD supports the   following    keywords   without   JCL
counterparts:
.sp
       TYPE=EITHER  specifies removal of the in-use attribute from the
           DDNAME/DSNAME if  it has the  permanently allocated attribute
           and  unallocation of the DDNAME/DSNAME  if it does not have
           the permanently allocated attribute.
.sp
       TYPE=UNALLOC   specifies that  the DDNAME/DSNAME  is to  be
           unallocated even  if it  has the  permanently allocated
           attribute.
.sp
       TYPE=REMOVE  specifies removal of the in-use attribute even
           if  the DDNAME/DSNAME  does  not  have the  permanently
           allocated attribute.

           to be  included with the text  UNITs generated by the FREEDD
           macro. FREEDD does not initialize or inspect these text
           units.  if an RX-type address is followed by a  '@',   the
           RX-type address  points  to  a  fullword containing the
           address of the text unit.
          default: none.
.sp

           0 (exception:   if  the  error code  from  dynamic allocation
           is x'0438'  or x'0440'  (FREEDD macro failed because
           specified  DDNAME or DSNAME was  not allocated) then DDDD

Notes: The expansion of the FREEDD macro does not include any label.
        to branch to the FREEDD macro, code a named DS 0H  before it.
       Addressability: the literal pool and the DDDD macro must be
           addressable from  every FREEDD macro. if there  are two

If neither  code nor  STORAGE  is  coded,  the  resulting  macro
expansion is reusable but not reentrant.
.sp
To get reentrant CODE,   issue DDDD twice,  once with  code in a csect
and  once with STORAGE in  a dsect addressable  by all the DDD,  FREEDD
and CONCAT macros and by the DDDD with code.  the STORAGE form  of DDDD
reserves SPACE  and defines labels for use by the DDD,  FREEDD and DDDD
(code) macros. the DDDD (code)  macro does all initialization  of the
area reserved.  the user may reuse the SPACE  reserved by the DDDD
(STORAGE) macro in  any way  provided no  dynamic allocation  macro is
executing.

.us DDTU (data definition  text units)  - define  dynamic allocation
text units
.sp 2
Purpose: the DDD macro generates text units whose values are known  at
assembly  time.   the  DDTU macro  aids in  coding dynamic allocation
text units  whose values  are not  known until execution time.
.sp
In many programs,  even those where text unit values are not known at
assembly time,  the  DDTU macro is  not necessary.  the  dynamic
allocation  macros  DDD  and  FREEDD will take addresses of values not
known at assembly time.  to indicate that an operand  of a DDD or
FREEDD macro is an address of a value rather than a value itself,   add
the character '@' to the end of  an RX-type address in the  keyword
operand.  the run-time value facility  is easier to use  and maintain
than DDTU.  DDTU is  necessary only for those text  UNITs that do not
take a value,  such as TERM=TS,  and those that can take more than  one
value,   such as VOL=ser=  for more  than one VOLUME.
.sp
The  DDTU macro,   modeled  after  the  JCL  DD  statement, constructs
dynamic allocation text  UNITs with user-supplied labels.
.sp
Code the DDTU  macro with JCL keywords whose  value will not be known
until execution  time.  For  each value  not known until execution time,
code an  assembler symbol not defined elsewhere in the program.
.sp
The text  UNITs generated  are a  halfword key,   a halfword
number-of-following-parameters which is either 0 or 1,  and, if 1, a
halfword length.  The length, if present,  is always the maximum length
that dynamic allocation will  accept for the text unit being created.
.sp
Text units formed by DDTU may  be used in dynamic allocation by
specifying their labels as subparameters of the  KEYADDS= keyword on
the DDD or FREEDD macros, or copying them  to a workarea,   MODIFYing
them,  and  specifying  the  workarea addresses as subparameters of the
KEYADDS=  keyword.
.sp
The DDTU macro expansion contains no executable code.
