.subsection 'Program Function'
.pp
This program will extend the number of directory blocks in a PDS by a 3
byte amount passed in the parm field on the execute card.  This saves
the scratching and reallocating of the data set.  Method of operation:
.pp
The format 1 DSCB is read and a check is made to insure partitioned
organization.  The format 4 DSCB is read and the number of directory
blocks that can fit on a track is stored off.  The directory is read,
number of directory blocks is counted and note is made of end of
directory.  The end of the new directory is calcu- lated and any members
of the PDS that are in the new directory area are moved until that area
is cleared.  Aliases are noted and a stow replace is done for them also.
All load modules that have a note list are readjusted to reflect their
new location in the PDS.  The directory is now extended by the number of
blocks specified.
.pp
.us NOTE:
At this time there is no support for updating a scatter translate table
in a moved member if that member was link-edited with the scatter load
attribute (i.e. IEANUC01).
