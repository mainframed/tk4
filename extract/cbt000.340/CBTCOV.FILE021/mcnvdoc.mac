            This program is used to convert one MVS catalog into
            another MVS catalog by generating IDCAMS control
            statements from a listing of the source catalog.


              Module name = MCNVTCAT

              Descriptive name =  MVS/SP system IPO supplied
                  program to convert an MVS catalog.

.subsection 'Function'

                 Rebuild usercatalog, nonvsam, and gdg entries
                 and their associations from a IDCAMS LISTCAT
                 listing of a previous MVS catalog.

.subsection 'Operation'

                   This program will read the output of an IDCAMS
                   'LISTCAT all'    command and produce control
                   cards to import the user catalogs and define their
                   associations, define nonvsam data sets and include
                   their associations, and define gdgs and their
                   associations.

                  A parameter may BE specified which will BE used as
                  the catalog and password for each operation.  Specify
                  as    parm='catname/password'   on the execute card.
                 This can BE used to eliminate the prompting for the
                 master catalog's password or to specify an
                 alternate catalog name.

                 Note that the output of LISTCAT defaults to
                 LRECL=125,BLKSIZE=625,RECFM=VBA .

                 Note:  all nonvsam data sets whose name begins with
                 'SYSCTLG.'  Will BE changed to  'SYSCTLG.Vxxxxxx'
                 where xxxxxx is the volser on which the data set
                 resides.  This is done to pick up added
                 support from su8(data management)


.subsection 'Notes'

                  Dependencies = character is EBCDIC.  Reassemble
                     if a different character set is needed.

                  Restrictions =
                     output control statements allow for a maximum
                         of six volumes per data set.
                     Input is dependent on format of IDCAMS
                         'LISTCAT all' output.
