         AMS provides an operator console interface to Access Method
         Services (IDCAMS).

         AMS is invoked via an operator START command to a JCL
         procedure in SYS1.PROCLIB. The following JCL is suggested:

               //AMS     PROC
               //IEFPROC EXEC PGM=CONSAMS,PARM='MARGINS(1,120)'
               //AMSDUMP  DD  SYSOUT=A    IDCAMS SNAP DUMP
               //SYSOUT   DD  SYSOUT=A    OUTFILE OUTPUT
               //SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=A    CONSOLE LOG
               //SYSUDUMP DD  SYSOUT=A

         The PARM field on the EXEC statement is passed to IDCAMS,
         which executes it as the first command.

         All DD statements are optional.

         AMSDUMP                 May be useful for debugging IDCAMS.
         SYSPRINT                May be used to obtain a hard copy of
                                 of the output written to the console.
         SYSOUT                  May be used via the OUTFILE parameter
                                 some the IDCAMS commands for hard copy
                                 output too voluminous for a console.

         To use the above procedure, enter the operator command:
               START AMS

         CONSAMS will respond with the message: AMS READY.
         To enter an IDCAMS command, use the operator modify command:
               MODIFY AMS,IDCAMS-command

         CONSAMS will pass the IDCAMS-command text to IDCAMS as a SYSIN
         record.
         IDCAMS will then respond with SYSPRINT records which CONSAMS
         will write via WTO to the console which entered the modify
         command.  A one second delay is imposed on consecutive WTOs
         to prevent excessive queued console output.

         To stop CONSAMS when it is waiting for a modify comand,
         enter the command:
               STOP AMS

         To cancel CONSAMS at any time, enter the command:
               CANCEL AMS
