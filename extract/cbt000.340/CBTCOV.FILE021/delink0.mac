   DELINK0 - SYSTEM/360 OS FE SERVICE AID PROGRAM.
             PRODUCES AN OBJECT MODULE FROM A LOAD MODULE.
             CREATES ESD FOR NON-EDITABLE MODULES.
             EXPANDS MODULE SIZE FOR PATCH AREA.

   SOURCE CREATED BY BILL GODFREY, PLANNING RESEARCH CORPORATION,
   BY DISASSEMBLING THE DELINK0 OBJECT DECK AND FIXING UP THE
   DISASSEMBLED CODE, WHICH HAD NO COMMENTS OR MEANINGFUL NAMES.
   MANY AREAS STILL NEED FIXING UP, BUT THE CODE MATCHES THE
   OS DELINK0 OBJECT DECK.

   DELINK IS DESCRIBED IN THE OS/360 FE HANDBOOK S229-3169.

   //DELINK  EXEC PGM=DELINK
   //SYSPRINT DD  SYSOUT=A                       OUTPUT MESSAGES
   //SYSLIB   DD  DSN=ANY.LOAD.LIBRARY,DISP=SHR  INPUT LIBRARY
   //SYSPUNCH DD  SYSOUT=B                       OUTPUT OBJECT DECK
   //SYSIN    DD  *                              INPUT CONTROL CARD
    MEMBER CSECT
   /*

   ONLY ONE CSECT MAY BE PUNCHED PER CONTROL CARD.

   IF COLUMN 1 OF THE CONTROL CARD IS A '>' (GREATER THAN SIGN)
   THEN THE CSECT SIZE IN THE PUNCHED DECK WILL BE EXPANDED.
   THE NEW SIZE MUST BE SPECIFIED FOLLOWING THE CSECT NAME, AS
   8 DECIMAL DIGITS OR X'NNNNNN' IN HEX, AND MUST BE GREATER
   THAN THE CURRENT LENGTH OF THE CSECT.
   FOR EXAMPLE:    > MEMBER CSECT X'0A10'

   IF THE CSECT NAME IS OMITTED, IT IS ASSUMED TO BE THE SAME
   AS THE MEMBER NAME. CSECT NAME IS REQUIRED IF > IN COL 1.
