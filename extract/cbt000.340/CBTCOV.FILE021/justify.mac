         This routine will read an assembler source file
         and reposition each section of each record to
         standard assembler source margins (1 10 16).
         Both source as well as macros (imbedded too) can
         be handled within the same execution.
         Quoted strings are handled but must be paired.
         PARM values may be used to override the default
         of 36 and 71 as specification of comments boundaries.

         Requirements:
               SYSPRINT - listing DDNAME
               SYSIN    - input source file
               SYSPUNCH - output source file

         PARM values if any must be specified as follows:
               PARM='bb,ee' (default = '36,71')
               bb - beginning column for comments
               ee - ending column for comments

         Truncation of comments is handled by adding a continuation
         'comments' card.
