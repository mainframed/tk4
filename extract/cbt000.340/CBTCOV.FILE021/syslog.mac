The SYSLOG data set contains a copy of essentially all messages written
to operator consoles. A copy of SYSLOG is retained in the Mass Storage
System for one month (31 days).  Note that you must have MOUNT authority
to access MSS data sets via TSO.
.pp
A TSO CLIST is available to allow scanning of SYSLOG online, or to print
selected portions of it.  Request Option 6 (TSO Command Processor of
SPF).  Then enter %SYSLOG.  A panel will be displayed containing a list
of time spans for all SYSLOG data sets for the last month. You may
scroll through the list and choose any one of the data sets. If you
choose to BROWSE it, you will enter SPF BROWSE directly against the MSS
data set.  If you choose to use the LOGSCAN service aid, an additional
panel will be displayed. This panel will prompt you for LOGSCAN
parameters. The output from LOGSCAN may be BROWSEd and/or printed.
.pp
The SYSLOG time span is derived from the data set name, which is of the
form 'ASYSLOG.Dyyddd.Thhmm', where yyddd and hhmm are the date and time
the data set was written to MSS.  You may notice some anomalies in the
SYSLOG time stamps.  Because the date and time in the data set name are
entered by an operator, they may not be completely accurate.  In
addition, SYSLOG is written by two system components.  The vast majority
of SYSLOG consists of JES3 DLOG, which is a copy of MLOG (printed
console hard copy).  However, MCS (MVS Multiple Console Support) will
create its own SYSLOG output whenever JES3 does not process a message.
This will happen under two circumstances.  First, IPL messages are
created prior to JES3 initialization.  Second, some messages are written
specifically to an MCS console only, such as the response to a DISPLAY
command.  Note also that it is possible to write the currently
accumulated SYSLOG to MSS at any time, so there may be multiple MSS data
sets for one day.
