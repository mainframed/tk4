.ix CVAFSUB
.ix Programs CVAFSUB
.sp
This subroutine is designed to return to the calling program information
about datasets on a volume.  It is capable of returning information on
a specific dataset or of reading the vtoc and returning information
about all datasets found.  Both indexed and non-indexed vtocs are
supported.
.sp
Using standard conventions register 1 points to a list of adcons and the
first adcon is the only one required.  The contents pointed to by the
first adcon are:
.sp
Byte 1 is the option byte and has the following options:
.sp
.fo off
01  Initialize subroutine.
    Determine if volume has indexed vtoc or not.
    Read format 4 DSCB and extract the number of tracks per cylinder.
    Return information about first dataset.
    Open VTOC for CVAF processing.
    NOTE:  The vtoc must have been allocated prior to calling CVAFSUB.
02  Continue processing of VTOC and return information on next
    dataset.
03  Close VTOC.
04  Process a specified dataset (uses OBTAIN macro)
.sp 2
Note: the option byte must be reinitialized for each call as the first
four bytes of the data area are overlaid by CVAFSUB on return as
documented below.
.sp 2
Option 01 requires the following additional information following
the option flag byte:
At offset +1 for a length of 8 must be the DDNAME used for the
allocation of the vtoc.
At offset +9 for a length of 44 are blanks or an optional dataset
prefix to be used when searching the VTOC.
.sp 2
Options 02 and 03 require no additional information.
.sp 2
Option 04 requires the following additional information following
the option flag byte:
At offset +1 for a length of 6 must be the VOLSER on which the
dataset is cataloged.
.sp 2
On return to the calling program the first 4 bytes of the data area
contain the address of a list of pointers to information about the
data set as follows.
.sp;.in +5;.fo off
Offset   Address of:              Length

.sp 2;.in -5;.fo off
Return codes:    0 = normal
                 4 = end of vtoc and termination performed
                 8 = obtain error for format4
                xx = cvaf error return code.
