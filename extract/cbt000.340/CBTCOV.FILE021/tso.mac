This is the TSO0 Dialog Program.

This program was written at CNA Insurance to replace the
option 6 (TSO) delivered with the PDF Version of ISPF. The
significant problem with that version is after typing a TSO
command on the screen, if the user hit his PFk2 (SPLIT) screen
key, the TSO command is lost.

s version has the following features:

The SPLIT screen bug described above is resolved.

The user now has 2 data entry lines for option 6 (Similar to
VM Version 2). The first data entry line is the regular ISPF
Command Line and is used for that purpose. The Second data
entry line is the TSO Command Line. This must only be used for
TSO Commands. Command Stacking using a delimiter is supported
for both lines.

The screen will now remember the last command entered every
time you invoke this option. If the last command was a stack
of TSO Commands, it will now remember the entire list.

When executing a stack of TSO Commands, if a command ends with
a non-zero return code, the user will be prompted - do you
want to continue or not.
