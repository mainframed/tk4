.subsection 'JCL Required'

 This routine eliminates data sets from system scratch volumes.

 Use:    //       EXEC  PGM=PREJOB,PARM=TEMPONLY
         //IEFRDER  DD  SYS1.PARMLIB(VATLST00),DISP=SHR

 Where the parm is optional and is the only parm acceptable.   If the
 parm is used, only temporary unused data sets are scratched else
 all unused data sets are scratched subject to the definitions below.*

.subsection 'Principle of operation'

 The specified VATLST is searched for public and storage volumes.
 The corresponding UCB is located for each such volume.
 The UCB is processed only if it also is marked public or storage.
 The VTOC is searched for data sets which are not in use.
 A data set which is not in use is scratched.
 A data set which is scratched is also uncataloged if the volume
 serial in the catalog matches.
 A permanent data set is considered in use if it appears in the data *
 set enqueue table (major name sysdsn).
 A temporary data set is considered in use if the job name contained *
 within the DSNAME belongs to a job in the system.
 A job is considered in the system if its name is in a CSCB.
 As a safety precaution, permanent data sets are not scratched from
 the sysres volume or from volumes which appear in the PREJOB TIOT,
 in the master scheduler TIOT, or in the SYS1.LINKLIB DEB.
