The COPYSDS command copies a sequential data set to another
sequential data set.

It can also copy a member of a pds, but when copying one member
to another the directory information is not copied, so a load
module copied with this command would not be executable.
See the COPYPDS command for copying one or more members from one
pds to another.

Both data sets must exist beforehand - this command does not
allocate a new data set.

See the TSO Help member for further information.
