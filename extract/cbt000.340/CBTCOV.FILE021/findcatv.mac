     This is an ISPF program designed to take the prefix of a dataset
and determine if it is cataloged in a CVOL or UCAT.
.sp
     The ISPF variables used are:

                   INDEX   =  contains the High Level Index on entry
                   CVOL    =  Updated with the Volser of CVOL or UCAT
                   CATTYPE =  Updated with characters CVOL for OS CVOL
                              or UCAT if cataloged in a Usercatalog
.sp
     To invoke via CLIST:

     ISPEXEC SELECT PGM(FINDCATV)

     insure that INDEX is predefined prior to invoking FINDCATV.

     To retrive the ISPF variables for CLIST processing:

     ISPEXEC VGET (CVOL CATTYPE)
