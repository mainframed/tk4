This program analyzes the TSO Broadcast dataset.  It displays the number
of available blocks and how they are used.  It also displays the TSO
users who have messages waiting.  In addition it also does a validity
check on records which are in the message pool to assure they are
chained off of a user record.  According to the documentation,
instances occur which can result in these garbage records existing.
