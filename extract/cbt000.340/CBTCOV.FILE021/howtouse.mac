.section 'How To Use These Utilities'
.pp
These TSO commands, programs, clists, etc reside in the libraries
documented in the section Where To Find.
.pp
Since the TSO commands do not reside in the LNKLSTxx you will have
to invoke them using the dynamic steplib commands.  These commands have
been placed in the linklist and require that 2 files be allocated
pointing to the desired steplib's.
.pp
File TASKLIB$ should point to one or more libraries to be used as a
dynamic steplib by the $P and $C TSO commands.  This is a non-authorized
means of invoking commands or programs.
.pp
File TASKLIB@ should point to one or more authorized libraries to
be used as a dynamic steplib by the @P and @C TSO commands.  This is an
authorized means of invoking commands or programs.

     Sample CLIST:
     PROC 0
     FREE F(TASKLIB$ TASKLIB@)
     ALLOC F(TASKLIB$) DS(AOST.LOAD) SHR
     ALLOC F(TASKLIB@) DS(AOST.LOAD) SHR
.fo on
.pp
You may now invoke any of these utilities under TSO by using the
dynamic steplib commands which are more completely documented in the TSO
section of this document.
