.section 'AOST ISPF Tools'
.pp
This section contains a brief description of some of the tools which
have been developed here at Rockwell or acquired from one of the
various user group tapes to enhance the ISPF environment.
.pp
Some of these tools are CLISTs, others are TSO commands, and some are
true ISPF programs.  For more information on any of these you can always
browse the source module for a complete understanding of how they work.
.point begin
.us GENPRINT.
This is a clist which enables the user to pass it a dataset name and
it will then prompt the user, via an ISPF panel, to specify one of
many print services to be used.  Some of these services are:
.point 2
PRINTOFF.
.point
Invoke the Xerox 9700 ISPF Print application.
.point
Invoke the Xerox 2700 ISPF Print application.
.point
Invoke ISPF EDIT or BROWSE.
.point
Keep or Delete the dataset.
.point 1
.us GENSUB.
This is a clist which is similiar to GENPRINT in that the user passes
it a dataset and then prompt the user via an ISPF panel
to specify whether the user whats to EDIT, BROWSE, return or
SUBMIT the dataset to the internal reader.
This is very useful to invoke after using ISPF file tailoring to
build a jobstream and then to verify what was built or allow the user
to modify what has been built prior to submission of the job.
.point
.us DSNINFO.
This is an ISPF program which will return in ISPF variables information
concerning the DCB, SPACE, VOLUME and UNIT of a specified dataset.
.point
.us FINDCATV.
This is an ISPF program which will return in ISPF variables information
concerning where a specified dataset is cataloged.  Also returned is
an indication of the type of catalog, VSAM or CVOL.
.point
.us FIXUPDSN.
This is an ISPF program which will fully qualify a specified dataset
name when it is passed via an ISPF variable.  This allows the user
to specify in an ISPF panel a dataset name using standard TSO syntax,
qualified in quotes or unqualified without quotes.  This has proven
useful when building JCL using ISPF file tailoring to insure correct
dataset name specifications and avoid JCL errors.
.point
.us JACCT.
This is an ISPF program which will return an ISPF variable containing
the 52 byte user accounting field for placement in a job card during
ISPF file tailoring.
.point
.us QSPF.
This is a TSO command which will pass a return code to indicate
whether it is being invoked under TSO (rc=0) or ISPF (rc=4).
QSPF is ideal for a CLIST which is intelligent enough to be used
either under ISPF or outside of ISPF.
.point
.us RETDSNVL.
This is an ISPF program to return the dataset name and volume
information when passed an ISPF variable containing a DD name.
.point
.us SHOWSPF.
This is an ISPF program which will return specified information about
the current operating environment and user.  Some of the information
available are: Programmer Name, Mail Code, Phone, ACF2 Accounting
information, System id(from SMCA), SYSNAME (from CVT), Terminal Name,
and more.
.point
.us WHATIF.
This is a TSO command which can be used in a CLIST to determine if
the dataset specified in an ISPF panel really exists prior to
invoking the desired function.
