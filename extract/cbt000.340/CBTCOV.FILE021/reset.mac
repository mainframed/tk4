 Reset is used to reinitialize (emtpy) partitioned data sets.  The
 user can optionally specify the number of directory blocks desired.
.sp
JCL:
.in +10
//stepname EXEC  PGM=RESET,PARM='RESET'
.br
//RESET    DD  DSN=pdsname,DISP=SHR

.pp
Where the PARM can optionally be coded as PARM='RESET(N)'
and N is the number of directory blocks desired.
.pp
Note: Error message output is written as WTO's with route code 11.
.sp 2
.pp
Method:  If N is not coded, the program counts the current directory
blocks and rewrites that same number of empty directory blocks;
otherwise, the program writes N empty direntory blocks.
.pp
Then, a null member is added to and deleted from the partitioned
data set so that the end of data set pointer (DS1LSTAR) in the
DSCB will correctly point to the available space following the
directory and the end of directory (EOF) mark.
