Tape map is a slick utility from UCLA via the CBT Tape to map a tape
of unknown or known characteristics.  The output reports indicate
labels, DCB's, feet of tape and other data of interest.  If the
file is an unload via IEBCOPY then a report is generated on SYSPRNT2
listing the unload member names and the original DCB.

Valid PARM options are:
                      TEST

      work.
