.section 'TRANSBDT - Mass Transfer w MVS/BDT'
.ix TRANSBDT
.ix programs TRANSBDT
.sp 2
TRANSBDT will generate the MVS/BDT control cards for input to BDTBATCH
to transmit a large number of datasets from one node to another using
MVS/BDT.
.sp
Restrictions:  Only  DSORG=PS and PS datasets are processed.  If a
dataset is open or otherwise unavailable then it will not have a
transaction generated.  NOTE: Only DASD datasets will  be processed
.sp 2
PARM:  A single PARM is required and it must be a high level  index.
optionally if *SELECT is specified then the datasets to be transmitted
are coded in control cards in file BDTQIN.

Control Cards:  (file BDTQIN)
Dataset name starting in column 1 (must be cataloged)

NAME defines the name to be assigned to the transaction.

NEWVOL defines the output DASD volser to receive the transmitted
dataset.
Exclusive of MSVGP option.

VOLREF defines a dataset to be used to locate the output volume.
Exclusive of MSVGP option.

NEWUNIT defines the output unit device type default is sysallda.
Exclusive of MSVGP option.

NOTIFY defines the userid to receive the tso send notification upon
completion of the transfer.

TONODE defines the receiving MVS/BDT node.

FROMNODE define the transmission node (and the node on which this
program is executing).

MIG= defines what to do  with migrated datasets.

     YES tells the code to process only migrat datasets.
     NO tells the code not to process migrat datasets.
     BOTH tells the code to  process both migrat and online datasets.
     (*** ignored if PARM=*select  ***)

SYSTEM is optional and defines the POLY-BDT to process the transaction.
