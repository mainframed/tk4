.ix Programs COPYMODS
.sp 2
This program was written by Paul Tokheim (AFAFC) and is designed
to copy all files from a single input tape to from 1 to 10 output
tapes. The EXCP access method is used for this copy.
.sp
COPYMODS first determines which output DD's are present by scanning the
TIOT looking for ddnames of OUT1 thru OUT10.  It then reads all files on
the input tape and copies them to the output tapes, including labels.
If an error occurs on the input tape and ABEND User 69 will occur.  If
an error occurs on an output tape the program will quit writing to that
tape.
.sp
The JCL to execute COPYMODS is:
.sp
.in +5;.fo off
//step   EXEC PGM=COPYMODS
//SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=*     copy report
//IN       DD VOL=SER=xxx  input tape
//OUT1     DD output tape # ×
  .
  .
//OUT10    DD output tape # 10
.in -5;.fo on
