     To run VTAM under VM:  (If only Cross Domain access is needed
                             skip steps 1 through 3)

     First find a VM terminal .

     Second, issue a #CP DISABLE xxx    where xxx = the terminal address

     Third, issue a #CP ATT xxx * D5x   where xxx = terminal address
                                        and D5x is D50-D5F

     Fourth, (If Cross Domain sessions to WCC1 & WCC2 are required)
             issue a #CP att 018 * 018  to get 3705#A

     Fifth, IPL MVS
     or
     issue V CH(D),ONLINE
     issue V PATH(D5x),ONLINE
     issue V D5x,ONLINE
     issue V PATH(018),ONLINE
     issue V 018,ONLINE
     then
     verify that AVTSS2 is online to JES3

     Sixth, to start VTAM

     issue S NET,,,(COLD,LIST=VM)

     then wait till NET starts

     Seventh, issue Start commands for desired VTAM applications

     If access to other computing centers is needed then do the
       following additional VTAM commands:
       V NET,ACT,ID=CDRMDEF
       V NET,ACT,ID=CDRSC

     NOTE: doing a #CP SAVESYS with NET active could cause problems
     when recovering due to changes in the VTAMLST.
