            This program produces IDCAMS control statements to
            define CVOLS into an MVS master catalog from an OS
            system catalog.

              Module name = SCNVTCAT

              Descriptive name =  MVS/SP system IPO supplied
                 routine to produce AMS (access method services)
                 control statements define alias and define
                 nonvsam for CVOL entries.

.subsection 'Function'

                 Generate AMS control statements from IEHLIST LISTCTLG
                 output listing.

.subsection 'Operation'

                    If input line is for 'CVOL ptr' then
                      if CVOL not been previously defined then
                        produce 'define nonvsam(name(sysctlg.V_____)..
                      Produce  'define alias name(_______) relate
                        (SYSCTLG.V______))' control statement
                    else ignore input line and read another
