 Function/Operation:  Reads and edits the volume table of contents
        (VTOC) from one or more direct access volumes and prints
        information about the data sets on it and a track usage map.
        Optionally, it lists the directory of each partitioned data
        set on the volume.

 Input:  The parameter field referenced by R1 begins with a half-word
        containing the binary length of the byte string which follows
        it.  The string consists of a series of parameter words
        separated by commas.  Legal words are:
              DUMP    causes the DSCB's to be listed in hex following
                      their formatted listings.
              PDS     causes the directory of each PDS to be listed.
              MAP     causes the track usage map to be printed.
         <DDNAME>     causes one specific DDNAME to be processed.

 Output:  a printed listing describing the data sets and track usage
          for each volume.

 Data Sets:  Printed output is delivered to a data set described on a
        DD card with DDNAME 'SYSPRINT'.  Each volume to be listed must
        have a DD card specifying VOL=SER and UNIT.  The DDNAMEs can
        be any except JOBLIB, STEPLIB, SYSPRINT, SYSABEND, SYSUDUMP,
        SYSIN, or VTOCLIST unless a specific DDNAME was specified in
        the parm field.  If a dsname is specified on a DD card, and if
        that data set is a PDS, then only that data set will be
        processed and all its directory entries will be listed.


 Exits-normal:  returns via reg 14 with return code 0.

 Exits-error:  returns via reg 14 with return codes as follows:
        4  - missing DD card;
        8  - bad format in a DSCB;
        12 - permanent I/O error in a VTOC or PDS directory;
        16 - error return from an indexed VTOC macro;
        20 - unable to open 'SYSPRINT' data set.
