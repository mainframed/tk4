.sp 2

This is the HOLD command table command.

It will allow a user to save his current function status and
invoke the Primary Option Panel. This is liking Stacking ISPF
sessions. The user will be able to type

COMMAND ===> HOLD 3.2

The 3.2 is optional. This will hold his current function and
invoke the Primary Option Menu. Because he typed 3.2, he would
jump straight to option 3.2.

When the user types =X to get out of the screen, he will
resume the function executing when he typed HOLD. Some users
may choose to set a PFKey to the word HOLD. This will act like
a Pseudo SPLIT screen key (PF2).
