There are over 50 predefined screens which can be used. To determine
the names of the screens use one of the index screens. The screen
called $INDEX lists all the OMEGAMON screens that are available in
alphabetic order. $INDEX2 lists the OMEGAMON screens by function.
When you begin OMEGAMON you must first hit enter to go to the default
screen. Then you can go to any other screen by typing in the screen's
name in the upper left hand corner where the '_______________' begins.
When you hit enter without a name you get your present screen updated
to reflect what happened from the last time you hit enter. Screen
PF10 gives a tutorial directory. By entering the screen name of STOPI
you terminate the OMEGAMON session.
