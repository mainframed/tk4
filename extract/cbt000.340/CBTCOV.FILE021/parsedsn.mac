PARSEDSN is an ISPF program designed to simplify CLIST and SKELETON
usage under ISPF by parseing the dsn passed and parseing it into the
following ISPF variables:
.sp
The input dataset name may be fully qualified in quotes or unqualified
without quotes.  If in quotes then the quotes will be removed and the
parse will continue.  If unqualified the the users prefix will be
appended to the dataset name and the parse will continue.
.sp
The name of the variable containing the dataset name to parse must be
provided via the PARM.  If not then the default is rdsn.
.sp
The first character of the input variable name will be used as the first
character of the output variable names.  (i.e. If the input variable
name is XDSN then the output variable names will be XDS, XDSQ, etc. )

To invoke via CLIST:
 ISPEXEC SELECT PGM(PARSEDSN) PARM(dsn-variable-name)

To retrieve the parsed variables:
 ISPEXEC VGET (RDS RDSQ RDSQM RDSP RDSS RDSM)
