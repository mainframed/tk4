.pp
To install the AOST programs, clists, TSO commands and ISPF datasets
you will need to allocate all of the datasets documented in Chapter
.ur &libchap .

To use the $C and it's aliases under ISPF you will have to add them to
ISPF module ISPTCM, and flag them as command processors.  This is only
required if you place this module in LPA or MLPA.
.pp
Next if ACF2 is installed you will have to define the resources to ACF2
to allow access to the non-authorized facilities ($) and the authorized
facilities (@) provided by these commands ($C $P @C @P @X and @Y).  The
default resources are: type= CMD name= $SYSUTIL and @SYSUTIL.

If ACF2 changes then these commands might need to be reassembled.
.pp
If PCF II is installed then the $C, $P, @C, @P, @X, @Y  commands must be
authorized for the selected user audience.
.pp
The IEAAPFxx member of SYS1.PARMLIB will have to be updated to
show AOST.LOAD as an authorized library.
.pp
$C will now have to be assembled and linkedited RENT and AC=1.
$C will link with aliases @C, @P, $P, @X and @Y and may be in either
LPA, MLPA or Linklist.
.pp
IKJEFTE2 or IKJTABLS must be updated to include @X and @Y as authorized
TSO commands.
.pp
You must now authorize each specific user or group of users to use
these ACF2 resources or no one will be able to use them.

Program SHOW is a generalized callable program to return to the
caller selected information from system type control blocks.  It is
currently set up to extract information from the ACF2 LID control block
such as programmer name, phone, mail code, etc.  This program should
be modified to work in your enviroment.
