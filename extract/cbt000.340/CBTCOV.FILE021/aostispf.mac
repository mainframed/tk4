.section 'Introduction to AOST ISPF'
.ix AOST ISPF
.pp
ISPF Panels have been created along with related clists and programs to
allow many of the utilities, programs and TSO commands documented in
this manual to be executed under ISPF.
.pp
These may be used as is or you may use them as models to create your own
panels.
.sp
NOTE:  Many of these panels have an associated HELP panel.
.pp
If you wish to use these panels with your own then I suggest that you
allocate your own ISPF libraries and concatenate them before the AOST
libraries using the clist below.  You could then copy ISP@MSTR from
AOST.ISPPLIB and add your own menu items.
.sp 2
Several of the ISPF Panels have been modified to invoke the SPFVINIT
program to establish selected variables on the first entry of the
application.  See ISP@MSTR for details on how to use this program.  (the
source is in AOST.SOURCE).

.section 'ISPF Allocation Clist'
.ix AOST ISPF Clist
.pp
To allocate the AOST ISPF libraries you can use the system supplied
PREISPF clist.  You will have to allocate your ISPTABL, TASKLIB$ and
TASKLIB@ files when using these clists.
.pp
Below is a sample of the use of the PREISPF clist.
.subsection 'Sample PREISPF Clist Use'
.fo off
CONTROL  NOMSG
FREE     FILE(ISPTABL SYSHELP TASKLIB$ TASKLIB@)
CONTROL  MSG
ALLOCATE FILE(SYSHELP) +
          DATASET('AOST.HELP' 'SYS1.HELP' 'ATSO.MVSHELP' ) SHR
ALLOCATE FILE(TASKLIB$) DATASET(your.load 'AOST.LOAD') SHR
ALLOCATE FILE(TASKLIB@) DATASET('AOST.LOAD') SHR

   PREMLIB('your.MSGS    ''AOST.ISPMLIB'' ') +
   PRESLIB('your.SKELS   ''AOST.ISPSLIB'' ') +
   PRETLIB('your.TABLE   ''AOST.ISPTLIB'' ') +
   PREPROC('your.CLIST   ''AOST.CLIST''  ') +
   LLIB('your.LLIB       ''AOST.LOAD''')
ISPSTART
.fo on
.pp
ISPSTART is used by the ISPF/PDF product to display the Master
Application Menu as the first panel.
.pp
If you just wish to use the PDF component of the ISPF/PDF product then
you can use either ISPF or PDF to enter the ISPF Primary Option Menu.
This menu is the one that allows EDIT/BROWSE/UTILITIES etc.
.pp
You can find this clist in AOST.CLIST(PRESAMP).
.pp
If you should leave ISPF at anytime during your TSO session and wish
to reenter ISPF then you will have to:
.point begin
Enter ISPSTART
.point
or Enter ISPF PANEL(ISP@MSTR) if under the old ISPF.
.point end
.sp
.us NOTE:
I suggest that you place this clist into dataset userid.PROC.CLIST($ON).
This will place you immediately into the AOST ISPF Master Application
Menu after LOGON.
