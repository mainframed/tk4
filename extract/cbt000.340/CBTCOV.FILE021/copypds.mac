The COPYPDS command copies an entire pds, or selected members,
to another pds.

The 'IEBCOPY' utility is invoked.  the 'SYSPRINT' messages
from IEBCOPY are written to wherever filename(SYSPRINT) is
allocated - usually to the terminal.

COPYPDS allows you to copy a member and its alias, which
cannot be done correctly with the 'copy' command.
Specify the member and alias name in the 'select' keyword.

See the TSO Help member for further information.
