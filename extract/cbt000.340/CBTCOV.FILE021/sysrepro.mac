data set.  It is faster than IEBGENER and prints a summary of the copy
operation, including record counts.

Sample JCL:
.sp
  //STEP EXEC PGM=SYSREPRO
  //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=A
  //SYSUT1   DD DSN=INPUT.DATA,DISP=SHR
  //SYSUT2   DD DSN=OUTPUT.DATA,DISP=(NEW,KEEP),
  //            UNIT=,VOL=,LABEL=,SPACE=
.fo on;.sp 2
.pp
If the output file does not have DCB attributes, the attributes will be
copied from the input file.
.pp
The PARM field may be used for partial copies.  It may contain one
integer, indicating the number of records to copy, or two integers
separated by a comma, indicating the number of records to copy and the
number of records to skip.  To skip some records and then copy all
subsequent records, specify just a comma followed by the number of
records to skip.
.pp
The program does not copy keyed records, nor does it copy
user data from a pds directory entry when copying a member.
.pp
This program copies part or all of a sequential
dataset of fixed, variable, or undefined records.
.sp 2
The PARM field can specify:
.point begin
A limit on the number of records to copy,
.point
The number of records to skip before copying,
.point
That only n out of every d records are to be copied, where d is the
third number in the PARM field and n is the fourth.
.point end
