    THIS PROGRAM PRINTS A PAGE CONTAINING A ROW OF BLOCK
    LETTERS.  THE PARM FIELD SPECIFIES THE LETTERS TO BE
    PRINTED.  UP TO 8 CHARACTERS ARE ALLOWED.

    SAMPLE JCL
      //STEP EXEC PGM=PARMBLOC,PARM='STRING'
      //SYSBLOC  DD SYSOUT=A

    IF THERE IS NO SYSBLOC DD PRESENT, IT WILL TRY SYSPRINT.

    THE STRING IN THE PARM FIELD MAY BE FOLLOWED BY A COMMA AND
    THEN SOME OPTION CODES.  THESE CODES ARE

    RECFM=FBA,LRECL=121,BLKSIZE=121.
    IF DIFFERENT ATTRIBUTES ARE PRESENT IN THE JCL OR
    DATA SET LABEL, THEY WILL BE RECOGNIZED AND USED.
