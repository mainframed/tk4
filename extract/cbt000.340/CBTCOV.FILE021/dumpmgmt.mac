INTRODUCTION

The dump management and analysis application addresses three types of
dumps: SVC dumps, stand-alone dumps, and SYSMDUMPs.  All three are in
unformatted machine readable form which must be formatted by a utility
program.

SVC dumps are produced when the system detects an error condition within
the system itself.  The operator may also produce one via the DUMP
console command.  SVC dumps contain portions of one or more address
spaces.  They reside in SYS1.DUMPnn data set and may be migrated to mass
store.

Stand-alone dumps are produced by the operator by IPLing the AMDSADMP
program.  Stand-alone dumps contain all address spaces.  They reside on
magnetic tape and are copied to mass store as soon as possible.

SYSMDUMPs are produced by problem programs as an alternative to SYSABEND
or SYSUDUMP. They reside in a user data set.

GTF (Generalized Trace Facility) output is produced by the AHLGTF
service aid program. GTF output consists of a chronological trace of
various internal system events. The output is similar to the system
trace table but contains more information.  It may reside either in a
user data set or in buffers in a dump.

The dump management and analysis application uses ISPF panels to
facilitate access to various dump management functions.

The dump management application displays tables of dump data sets. It
allows you to select dumps from a table for analysis, deletion, or
migration to mass store.  Menu items are also provided for auxiliary
functions which may be useful in selecting a dump (Info/System, software
LOGREC records, and SYSLOG console output).

The dump analysis application provides access to IPCS (Interactive
Problem Control System), AMDPRDMP (Print Dump), and auxiliary functions
which may be useful in analyzing a dump (software LOGREC, SYSLOG,
AMBLIST, Info/System, and SMP/E). The menus display the available
facilities in a logical, structured form. For those facilities which
require parameters, panels are provided to prompt for appropriate
values. Extensive tutorial panels are provided.

IPCS is recommended for most dump analysis rather than AMDPRDMP. IPCS is
interactive. It is much faster than AMDPRDMP, produces less extraneous
output and has more capability. There are a few functions unique to
AMDPRDMP. GTF output formatting is the major one.

SIMPLE ACCESS

IPCS must be executed in three layers when used with ISPF. IPCS must be
executed first, then ISPF, and finally the dump management and analysis
application.

All ISPF data sets must be allocated first, including the AOST data
sets. This may be done via the the AOSTISPF CLIST. Then execute the
IPCSTART CLIST. Do not execute ISPF or ISPSTART (IPCSTART does this
automatically). For example:
.fo off;.sp
     (1) Place your TSO session in READY mode
     (2) Enter %AOSTISPF
     (3) Enter %IPCSTART
     (4) Select option 2.8 on the AOST master application menu
.fo on;.sp
The version (MVS/XA or MVS/370) of IPCS must match the version of the
dump you intend to analyze. IPCSTART will prompt you for the version of
IPCS you intend use. The correct version is required for dump analysis.
The version is irrelevant for dump management.

Dump Management is available even if you do not use IPCSTART. However,
only limited Dump Analysis will be available.

OPTIONAL PARAMETERS

IPCSTART provides several parameters which allow optional control over
the initialization of IPCS and ISPF.  All IPCS and ISPF parameters are
supported.

You may wish to execute IPCSTART in your PROC.CLIST($ON) CLIST. The
overhead extremely small, and you will have full ISPF capability. The
"OS" parameter may be used to inhibit prompting for Operating System
version (XA or 370).

Notes:

(1) The OS parameter inhibits the prompt for Operating System version.

(2) Your IPCS dump directory is allocated automatically if it does not
exist.  There are separate directories for MVS/XA and MVS/370. The REUSE
option will work only if this application allocated the dump directory.
If you have an old directory and wish to use REUSE, specify NEW (once
for MVS/XA and once for MVS/370). Then REUSE can be specified at any
time.

(3) TSOTEST establishes a TEST task above IPCS and ISPF. If you wish to
use your attention key to reach TEST, the attention interrupt routines
in IPCS and ISPF must be disabled. This is done in ISPF by using the
TEST, TESTX, TRACE, or TRACEX option. Alternatively, use PDF TEST
(option 7). For IPCS, use the USER or IBM panel to enter the subcommand
SETDEF TEST.

(4) TASKLIB allows you to use your own IPCS exit routines. You may wish
to use this parameter in you PROC.CLIST($ON) CLIST.
