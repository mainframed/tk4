This is an ISPF program designed to
read the director of a specified pds and build an ISPF
table of the member names which can then be used by
other ISPF program's.
.pp
To invoke DIRBUILD the following ISPF command is used:
.in +10
ISPEXEC SELECT PGM(DIRBUILD) PARM(table-name,dsname-variable)
.in -10
.pp
The first parameter of the parm is the name to be used for the ISPF
table.  The second parameter is the name of the ISPF variable which
contains the fully-qualified dsname of the PDS.
.pp
Defaults are PARM(DIRTBL,PDSDSN)
.pp
The fields defined in the ISPF table built by DIRBUILD are:
.point begin
