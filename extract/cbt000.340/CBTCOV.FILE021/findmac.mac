.subsection 'Description'
.sp
This is a program to scan an assembler language program and provide a
list of all macros used in the program.  This is very useful when
preparing a program to be given to another to verify that all required
macros accompany the source.
.sp
There is a table within the program which contains the mnemonics for all
'current' assembler instructions.  This table is used to screen out
all instructions which are not macros.

The JCL to invoke FINDMAC are:
