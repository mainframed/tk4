ON MAY 21, 1990, I BROKE AN IBM 3480 CARTRIDGE APART AND MEASURED
 IS AS 652 FEET IN LENGTH. THIS TAPE WAS COMPLETELY FULL OF SMF
 DATA (A COPY OF COURSE) AND TAPEMAP SHOWED THAT IT WAS ONLY
 503 FEET IN LENGTH. I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT ALL MEANS, MAYBE THERE
 HAS TO BE A LONG LEADER AND TRAILER ON THE TAPE

AS OF YET (03/22/87) TAPEMAP DOES NOT HAVE 3480 SUPPORT

1 MILLIMETER   =     .039   INCH
1 CENTIMETER   =    0.39    INCH
1 INCH         =    2.54    CENTIMETERS
