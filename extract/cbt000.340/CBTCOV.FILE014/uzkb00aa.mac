 THIS PACKAGE IS DESIGNED TO PERFORM INTENSIVE TESTING ON CKD-DEVICES.
 MAKING USE OF THE RPS FEATURE THE CHANNEL UTILISATION CAN BE KEPT
 VERY LOW.

 THE PACKAGE IS COMPOSED OF:
     1)  PROGRAM STDDINIT WRITTEN IN ASSEMBLER, IS USED TO WRITE A
         TEST PATTERN ON THE DISK.
     2)  PROGRAM STDDEXEC IS A FORTRAN MAIN-MODULE WITH A FORTRAN-
         AND A ASSEMBLER SUBROUTINE. THE STRESS-TESTING ITSELF
         IS DONE BY THIS PROGRAM.

 OPERATION:
     RANDOM SEEKS ARE GENERATED. IF THE SEEK RESULTS IN NO ARM MOVEMENT
     A FULL TRACK READ/WRITE OPERATION IS SET UP.
     THE RATIO OF SEEKS TO READ/WRITES AND SO THE CHANNEL UTILISATION
     IS A FUNCTION OF THE ALLOCATED SPACE AND THE GEOMETRY OF THE DISK.
     ON A 3380 WITH 884 CYLINDERS ALLOCATED THE CHANNEL UTILISATION
     IS BELOW 5%.
