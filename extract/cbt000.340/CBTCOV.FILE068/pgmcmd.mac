%---------------------PROGRAM/COMMAND PROCESSOR FROM TSO----------------
%
%
%      This facility allows you to call either a program or execute a
%      SPF. Normally if you try to execute an authorized program
%      from SPF it loses authorization and you will normally
%      get errors in these two categories.
%
%      a) Messages of the type : Program not authorized
%      b) Abend                : S047
%
%      The program must either be in the linklist or in any steplib
%      that you have in your logon proc or that you have dynamically
%      allocated by using the STEPLIB facility.
%
%      (Note under TSO/E rel 2.1 TSOEXEC will do this function for you).
