    THE CURRENTLY USED DIRECTORY IS KEPT IN VIRTUAL STORAGE. APPROXIMATE
    BYTES PER 80-BYTE RECORD ARE REQUIRED.  THUS, FOR VERY LARGE DIRECTO
    LARGER REGION SIZE MAY BE REQUIRED.  USING SPLIT SCREEN USES MORE MA
    STORAGE THAN SINGLE SCREEN SO YOU MAY WANT TO AVOID USING SPLIT SCRE
    IF IT IS NECESSARY TO WORK WITH VERY LARGE DIRECTORY.
