%-------------------------EXPAND PDS DIRECTORY--------------------------
%
%      This facility will expand the directory of a pds by a given numbe
%      blocks. Members will be moved to make space if necessary.
%
%      Note : If you have a relatively full pds compress it first.
%
%      This facility is extremly useful if you do not wish to go through
%      all the trouble of re-allocating and copying the dataset.
%
%      Please enter the PDS you wish to expand and the number of blocks
%      you wish to add to the directory. Enter also the volume if its
%      not catalogued. Unquoted datasets will be prefixed by your
%      user-id. (Scatter type load modules--rarely used--cannot be handl
%
%      To end press PF3 .
