   You reached this panel by entering o as a line command from a
   MEMLIST panel.  This command option panel directs you as to which
   PDS subcommands are available as line commands; enter a one or two
   letter choice to proceed to the next panel.

   Shorthand notes:
    1.  From the MEMLIST panel, you can bypass the line command
        option panel.  For example, enter o.v as a line command
        to enter the VERIFY assistance panel.
    2.  From the line command option panel, you can bypass the
        assistance panel.  For example, enter:  v.stats noload
        to format the subcommand:  Verify memname stats noload

   To get explanations of PDS subcommands, you need to reference the
   PDS HELP data set.  Enter HE from the%OPTION ===>+line on the line
   command option panel to use the HELP subcommand assistance panel.
