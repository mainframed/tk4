   PDS provides entry assistance for each of its commands which may be
   used as line commands.  To use this facility, enter o to the left of
   any member name on which you want entry assistance.  After the ENTER,
   the o line command option panel will direct you as to which PDS
   subcommands are available.

   Shorthand notes:
    1.  From the MEMLIST panel, you can bypass the line command
        option panel.  For example, enter o.v as a line command
        to enter the VERIFY assistance panel.
    2.  From the line command option panel, you can bypass the
        assistance panel.  For example, enter:  v.stats noload
        to format the subcommand:  Verify memname stats noload

   To get explanations of PDS subcommands, you need to reference the
   PDS HELP data set.  Enter o.he as a line command to use the HELP
   subcommand assistance panel.
