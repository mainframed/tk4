   The formal documentation for PDS is in the HELP data set under
   the same member name as the PDS command itself (example: both are
   called PDS70).  This panel formats a HELP request for any of the
   defined PDS subcommands.

   To get an explanation of a PDS subcommand, enter the subcommand
   name or some legal abbreviation and optionally HELP keywords to
   indicate the type of information you want.  For example to get
   syntax and operand information for the VERIFY subcommand, you
   should enter:  verify sy op  after%===>

+  To get an explanation of PDS messages such as PDS300A and PDS999E,
   you could enter:  msg msg(pds300,pds999)   As an alternative, you
   can request PDS's Extended Help just after receiving a warning
   (PDSxxxW) or an error (PDSxxxE) message by entering  .?  after
  %COMMAND ===>+on an ISPMODE or MEMLIST panel.
