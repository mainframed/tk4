%------------CALL AN AUTHORIZED PGM / EXECUTE A COMMAND PROCESSOR FROM T
%
%      This facility allows you to call an authorized program from
%      SPF or execute an authorized command processor from SPF. TSO is d
%      in such a way that if you try to execute an authorized program fr
%      authorisation is lost and you will get errors in these two catago
%
%      a) Messages of the type : Program not authorized
%      b) Abend                : S047
%
%      The program / command processor can be in any library. If it is
%      not in the linklist then allocate it and enter the ddname in the
%      DDNAME field. (Note : if the library is not authorized you may
%      still get s047 type abends). You must preallocate any datasets
%      your program needs at execution time. To exit press PF3.
%
%      NOTE : This facility avoids having to assign alternate STEPLIBS u
%             thereby allowing the standard TMP to be used.
