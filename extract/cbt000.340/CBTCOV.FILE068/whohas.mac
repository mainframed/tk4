%
%      This facility tells you which job(s) and/or TSO user(s) are
%      using a dataset and what type of control they have over it.
%      (i.e shared/exclusive systems/global use).
%
%      Use this command when you cannot get access to a dataset which
%      you think you ought to be able to access. For instance if you
%      are trying to edit a dataset and you get a message dataset in
%      use. It is also useful when you submit a job and the console
%      indicates JOB XXXX waiting for datasets. You can then scan
%      down the JCL and find out who has the dataset.
%
%      (Usually the problem is if someone submits a compilation
%      or assembly with a MACLIB or COPYLIB  with DISP=OLD in the JCL.
%
%      Enter the dataset name. As the system simply reserves on names
%      it does not matter if the dataset is cataloged or not.  ,
