%-------------------------REBUILD A CLOBBERED PDS-----------------------
%
%      This facility will attempt to recover as much as possible of the
%      member data of a PDS if the directory has been clobbered.
%      A new output PDS with the name USERID.GARBAGE.PDS will be created
%      As we did not use the directory member names are generated with t
%      name MEMBER#nnnn where nnnn = 0000-9999.
%
%      If the CLIST abends with SD37/SB37 there is an intermediate
%      dataset created with the name USERID.GARBAGE.SEQ which you can
%      use as input to IBM's IEBUPDTE utility to create a PDS.
%
%      You must edit the output PDS to change the member names.
%
%      Note : "GAS" members are also recovered.
%
%      NOTE: only JCL/SOURCE type PDS's having a LRECL of 80 can be fixe
%
%      Please enter the name of your broken dataset.
