%-----------CALL A NON-AUTHORIZED PGM/EXECUTE A COMMAND PROCESSOR FROM T
%
%      This facility allows you to call any non authorized program
%      SPF or execute a command processor from any library.
%      This is a handy way of testing commands/pgms without having to al
%      alternate STEPLIBS.
%
%      The program / command processor can be in any library. If it is
%      not in the linklist then allocate it and enter the ddname in the
%      DDNAME field. (Note : if you are trying to execute authorized pgm
%      you will get s047 abends). You must preallocate any datasets
%      your program needs at execution time.
%
%      For concatenated libraries the ddname is the ddname of the first
%
%      NOTE : This facility avoids having to assign alternate STEPLIBS u
%             thereby allowing the standard TMP to be used.
