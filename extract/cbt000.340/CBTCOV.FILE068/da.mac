%------------------SYSTEM ACTIVITY DISPLAY FOR MVS/XA-------------------
%
%      This facility gives you a very quick display of whats going
%      on in the system including swap counts which you dont get
%      from SDSF. This program is a modified version of the old
%      CHIMP command from LA MVSUG tape.
%
%      It saves you having to incur all the overhead of initialising
%      SDSF when you just want to see whats happening.
%
%      Before you start please note the following commands are available
%
%      Each command is entered at the top of the screen as a single lett
%
%      A - Display all tasks             B - Display batch and STC's
%      I - Switch to swapped in display  O - Switch to swapped in and ou
%      T - Display TSO tasks only        S - Stop exit from program
