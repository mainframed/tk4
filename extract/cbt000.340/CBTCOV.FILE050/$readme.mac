The ISPF STORage command displays main storage in your address space.
The command has been enhanced to support a Find command. The syntax is:

     Find string <NEXT|PREV> <CHARs|PREfix|SUFfix|WORD>

The parameters all function the same as the Find command under ISPF
Browse. In particular, "string" may be a simple string, a quoted string,
a Character string, a Picture string, a heXadecimal string, or an
asterisk (*). See the Browse tutorial for more information on the Find
command.

The STORAGE command tutorial may be viewed by pressing your HELP key
while under the STORAGE application, or by entering:

     Command ===> STORage ?

The tutorial has confused some people. It is implemented as a single
scrollable panel, rather than as a set of several panels. The easiest
way to view the entire tutorial is the same as a tutorial with multiple
panels:  simply press ENTER to view each panel/page.

The tutorial program, ISPTUTOR, has always interpreted the scroll
commands in a way which is different from the rest of ISPF:

    UP    (PF7/PF19)  displays a higher level tutorial panel.
    DOWN  (PF8/PF20)  skips to the next tutorial topic panel.
    RIGHT (PF10/PF22) displays the next tutorial panel, or scrolls a
                      scrollable panel to the next page. This is the
                      same as pressing ENTER.
    LEFT  (PF11/PF23) displays the previous tutorial panel, or scrolls
                      a scrollable panel to the previous page.

 Note: use of the RFIND command requires entries in the ISPCMDS table
 in file ISPTLIB in the following order:

 VERB     T  ACTION
                DESCRIPTION
 RFIND    0  &USRRFIND
                Repeat FIND
 RFIND    0  SETVERB
                Repeat FIND
