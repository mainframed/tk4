*                    TSO HELP FOR 'FSHELP' RELEASE 29.0     JULY 1997
)F Function -
  The FSHELP command displays a HELP member on a 3270 terminal
  in full screen mode.

  In the field labelled MEMBER==> _______, FSHELP displays the current
  HELP member; if the cursor is positioned to this field and a command
  name is entered, FSHELP will display that new member's HELP data.

  In the field labelled SUBCOMMAND==> _______, FSHELP displays the
  current subcommand of the HELP command; if the cursor is positioned
  to this field and a name is entered, FSHELP will display the member's
  HELP data for the entered subcommand.

  The field labelled INPUT===> _______ is the primary input field for
  FSHELP; any supported subcommand may be entered.

  In the field labelled SCROLL ===> __, FSHELP displays the default
  forward and backward scroll amount; if the cursor is positioned to
  this field and an amount is entered, that quantity will become the
  new default scroll amount.

  FIND notes:
   1.  A case insensitive search is performed.  That is, both
       upper and lower case characters can cause a match.
       To perform a case sensitive search use FINDCHR.
       To search for undisplayable data use FINDHEX.
       To search using picture mask characters use FINDPIC.
   2.  If no operand is entered, the previously used string is used.
   3.  Quotation marks are optional for the string unless it contains
       blank characters.
   4.  If any operands are specified the first must be the search
       string.  An unquoted asterisk means use the same string as
       previously.
   5.  A numeric second or third operand may be entered to specify
       a single starting column; otherwise all columns are searched.
   6.  A non-numeric second or third operand of 'FIRST', 'NEXT',
       'PREV', 'LAST', 'REST' or 'ALL' may be entered to indicate
       the search direction and starting location.
   7.  The 'REST' and 'ALL' operands causes lines without the string
       to be excluded from view.  No place marker lines for this
       exclusion are shown.  This exclusion is cancelled by other
       FIND/FINDNOT commands, and by 'UP' (including 'UP MAX'),
       'LIST', 'BOTTOM' and 'RESET'.  It is NOT cancelled by 'DOWN'

=FINDPIC=FP
)F   The FINDCHR subcommand positions the screen to a data string.

  FINDPIC notes:
   1.  The search argument can contain mask characters which are
       interpreted as representing certain types of characters.
       Valid picture mask characters are:
         =  any character             .  invalid characters
         @  alphabetic characters     -  non-numeric characters
         #  numeric characters        <  lower case alphabetics
         $  special characters        >  upper case alphabetics
         ^  non-blank characters
       Non-mask characters represent themselves, with matching of
       specific alphabetics being case insensitive.
   2.  If no operand is entered, the previously used string is used.
   3.  Quotation marks are optional for the string unless it contains
       blank characters.
   4.  If any operands are specified the first must be the search
       string.  An unquoted asterisk means use the same string as
       previously.
   5.  A numeric second or third operand may be entered to specify
       a single starting column; otherwise all columns are searched.
   6.  A non-numeric second or third operand of 'FIRST', 'NEXT',
       'PREV', 'LAST', 'REST' or 'ALL' may be entered to indicate
       the search direction and starting location.
   7.  The 'REST' and 'ALL' operands cause lines without the string
       to be excluded from view.  No place marker lines for this
       exclusion are shown.  This exclusion is cancelled by other
       FIND/FINDNOT commands, and by 'UP' (including 'UP MAX'),
       'LIST', 'BOTTOM' and 'RESET'.  It is NOT cancelled by 'DOWN'
       or 'TOP', by 'LEFT' or 'RIGHT' scrolling or by formatting
       subcommands.

)X Syntax -
   FINDPIC 'string' 'column'   FIRST / NEXT / PREV / LAST / REST / ALL

 Alias    - FP
 Defaults - same string and direction <or> NEXT (if string specified)
 Required - None.

))ALL     - Search forward from the start of the file or member
              for all occurrences, excluding lines without the string.
=FINDSMF=FS
)F   The FINDSMF subcommand positions the screen to an SMF record
     of the requested type and optionally also subtype.  It is only
     of practical value when SMF data is being REVIEWed.

  FINDSMF notes:
   1.  The first or only search argument specifying the SMF record
       type must be a single unquoted decimal number between 0
       and 255 inclusive.
   2.  An optional second or third numeric operand is allowed.
       It is a second search argument specifying the SMF record
       subtype and must be a single unquoted decimal number
       between 0 and 255 inclusive.
   3.  Subtype searches for system records (0 to 127) are only
       allowed for record types known to have subtypes.  Subtype
       searches for user records (128 to 255) are allowed without
       validation.
   4.  No validity checking is performed on the specified subtype.
       Hence it is possible to search for a subtype which does not
       exist.
   5.  If no operand is entered, the previously used string is used.
   6.  A search will be performed even for non-SMF data.
   7.  Obviously a column operand is not applicable.
   8.  A non-numeric second or third operand of 'FIRST', 'NEXT',
       'PREV', 'LAST', 'REST' or 'ALL' may be entered to indicate
       the search direction and starting location.

               Unquoted decimal integer in the 0 to 255 range.
               eg. "FS 30 NEXT" or "FS 30"
                    will search for any type 30 SMF record.
               eg. "FS 30 NEXT 5" or "FS 30 5 NEXT" or "FS 30 5"

=FINDNOT=FN
)F   The FINDNOT subcommand positions the screen to a text string
  which does NOT match the search argument.

  FINDNOT notes:
   1.  The case (upper or lower) of characters in the first operand
       is ignored.  For case sensitive searching use FCN.  To perform
       searching for hexadecimal data use FHN or FXN.  To perform
       searching for picture strings use FPN.
   2.  If no operand is entered, the previously used string is used.
   3.  Quotation marks are optional for the string unless it contains
       blank characters.
   4.  If any operands are specified the first must be the search
       string.  An unquoted asterisk means use the same string as
       previously.
   5.  A numeric second or third operand may be entered to specify
       a single starting column; otherwise all columns are searched.
   6.  A non-numeric second or third operand of 'FIRST', 'NEXT',
       'PREV', 'LAST', 'REST' or 'ALL' may be entered to indicate
       the search direction and starting location.

=FPN
)F   The FPN subcommand positions the screen to a picture string
  which does NOT match the search argument.

  FPN notes:
   1.  The search argument can contain mask characters which are
       interpreted as representing certain types of characters.
       Valid picture mask characters are:
         =  any character             .  invalid characters
         @  alphabetic characters     -  non-numeric characters
         #  numeric characters        <  lower case alphabetics
         $  special characters        >  upper case alphabetics
         ^  non-blank characters
       Non-mask characters represent themselves, with matching of
       specific alphabetics being case insensitive.
   2.  If no operand is entered, the previously used string is used.
   3.  Quotation marks are optional for the string unless it contains
       blank characters.
   4.  If any operands are specified the first must be the search

)O Operands - None.
=FULL
)F   The FULL subcommand specifies whether character data is displayed
  using full EBCDIC translation or only standard 3270 keyboard
  characters.  If turned on then only code-points that usually cause
  screen errors are deemed to be undisplayable.  If turned off then
  all characters not on a "standard" keyboard are deemed to be
  undisplayable.  (In character mode, undisplayable bytes are
  represented by a period ('.').)  Terminals with APL support may
  have normally unprintable characters displayed from the APL
  character set instead when in 'FULL OFF' mode, equivalent to one of
  the 3278A or the 3278T terminal display modes of ISPF, depending
  on the value set by the DISPLAY subcommand.
)X Syntax -
     FULL ON / OFF

 Aliases  - None.
 Defaults - opposite mode
 Required - None.
)O Operands -
))ON       - Specifies that all code points X'40' to X'FE' and some
             below X'40' are displayable characters.
))OFF      - Specifies that only keyboard and possibly APL
             characters are displayable.
=DISPLAY=DISP
)F   The DISPLAY subcommand specifies whether character data shown
  in FULL OFF mode is TEXT EBCDIC (as per TN and T11 print trains)
  or not.  This subcommand can be used to improve the readability
  of the data being REVIEWed.  The current setting is shown in the
  message area of the top screen line after the KEYS subcommand is
  issued.  The DISPLAY setting is saved in the user profile data set.
)X Syntax -
     DISPLAY A / T

 Alias    - DISP
 Defaults - opposite mode
 Required - None.
)O Operands -
))A        - Specifies that data code points are to be displayed
             from the standard character set if keyboard characters,
             or possibly from the graphic (APL) character set if not
             keyboard characters.  The graphic character set is not
             available on some terminals.  This mode is similar to
             the ISPF 3278A display mode.
))T        - Specifies that the "text" character set (similar to the
             TN and T11 print trains) is to be used for character
             code point interpretation.  Characters from the primary
             (standard) and alternate (graphic/APL) character sets
             may be used as appropriate in order to assist in data
             representation.  This mode is similar to the ISPF 3278T
             display mode, and is helpful in reading syntax diagrams.
=KEYS=?
)F   The KEYS subcommand displays the current Program Function Key
  values.  Each PF Key (1 to 24) has a default value which may
  be changed with the PFK command.
)X Syntax -

 Alias    - ?
 Defaults - None.
 Required - None.
)O Operands - None.
=RECALL
)F   The RECALL subcommand causes previously typed-in commands to be
  displayed in the primary input area where they may be changed if
  required and then reissued.  Note that single character input strings
  and text implied by PFK usage are not recallable.  The first command
  recalled is the most recently typed in command.  Consecutive RECALL
  commands cause increasingly older commands to be recalled.
)X Syntax -
     RECALL

 Alias    - The DUP character (X'1C').
 Defaults - None.

)O Operands - None.
=PFK
)F   The PFK subcommand changes PFK definitions for the duration of
  the FSHELP session; to change a PFK, a subcommand such as
  'PFK6 RIGHT 1'  is entered to change PFK6 to 'RIGHT 1'.

  By default, the PF KEYS are defined as the following:
              PFK1  - HEL     PFK2  - ASCII      PFK3  - END
              PFK4  - TSO     PFK5  - RFIND      PFK6  - FULL

              ## is a 1 or 2 decimal digit number in the range of
              0 to 24 inclusive.  Numbers from 1 to 24 specify a
              particular Program Function Key.  If ## is 0 then
              all 24 PF Keys will be assigned their default values.

 'newpfdata'- Specifies the new subcommand for this PF Key.

  displayed using 3270 extended highlighting and extended color,
  and which color is to be used for actual data display.  Colors
  for character mode and hexadecimal mode may be independently
  selected.  This command may cause errors on some terminals
  depending on terminal type and network definitions.  If no
  operands are entered then the color mode is switched to the
  opposite mode.

  The data display colors may be saved in the profile data set.
)X Syntax -
     COLOR  ON / OFF / #

            This may be rejected if the terminal is known to not
            support color or extended highlighting.
))OFF     - Specifies that 3270 data stream extensions may not be used.
))#       - Specifies the color to be used for actual data.
            If specified while in character mode then this color is
            used in character mode.  If specified while in hexadecimal
            mode then this color is used in hexadecimal mode.
            # must be a single hexadecimal digit and may be rejected
            if it is known that the color is not supported by the
            terminal.  The possible colors and their codes are:

)P 'lineno' -  Specifies the relative line number to which the screen
               is to be positioned.
=APPEND=ADD=TACKON
)F   The APPEND subcommand causes REVIEW to write records from the
  data being REVIEWed to an output file.  Records are written
  consecutively from the first record shown on the screen until
  the requested number of records has been copied or end-of-file is
  reached.  When complete, the first record AFTER the copied records
  is made the new top-of-screen record.  The APPEND subcommand
  performs the same processing as the CUTOFF subcommand except that
  the output file is opened for EXTEND, so that data is appended to
  any data already residing in the output file.  Obviously, APPEND
  and CUTOFF become identical when output is directed to SYSOUT or
  the user's terminal.
     A major feature of CUTOFF and APPEND is selectivity.  Not only
  can records be selected by manually scrolling to a specific record
  and cutting a specific number of records, but selectivity can be
  automated with FIND ALL and FINDNOT ALL.  Only records eligible
  for display can be CUT, so FIND ALL and FINDNOT ALL subcommands
  can be used to exclude records based on their data content not
  only from display but also from offloading by CUTOFF and APPEND.
)X Syntax -

                If the output file is not SYSUT2, then 'filename'
                MUST be specified.
)P 'record-count'
              - Specifies the number of records to be copied.
                If not specified then data is copied until end-of-file
                is reached.
=CUTOFF=CUT=CUTOVER
)F   The CUTOFF subcommand causes REVIEW to write records from the
  data being REVIEWed to an output file.  Records are written
  consecutively from the first record shown on the screen until
  the requested number of records has been copied or end-of-file is
  reached.  When complete, the first record AFTER the copied records
  is made the new top-of-screen record.  The CUTOFF subcommand
  performs the same processing as the APPEND subcommand except that
  the output file is opened for OUTPUT, so that data already residing
  in the output file is overwritten and lost.  Obviously, CUTOFF
  and APPEND become identical when output is directed to SYSOUT or
  the user's terminal.
     A major feature of CUTOFF and APPEND is selectivity.  Not only
  can records be selected by manually scrolling to a specific record
  and cutting a specific number of records, but selectivity can be
  automated with FIND ALL and FINDNOT ALL.  Only records eligible
  for display can be CUT, so FIND ALL and FINDNOT ALL subcommands

=CANCEL=CAN
)F   The CANCEL subcommand performs the same processing as the END
  subcommand without saving the REVIEW/FSHELP user profile to disk.
  The REVIEW/FSHELP user profile (which contains data display colors,
  scrolling amount and 24 PF Key values) is normally only rewritten to
  disk at the END of a FSHELP session if it has been changed during
  that session.  If a member list has not been displayed in a session
  then the FSHELP session is terminated without saving the user
  profile. If a member list has been shown it is reshown but the user
  profile is no longer considered to have been altered, even though
  the profile "in-core" still has the changes applied to it.  Changing
  the profile at this stage and exiting will cause all accumulated
  profile changes for the FSHELP session to be saved to disk unless
  another CANCEL is issued.
