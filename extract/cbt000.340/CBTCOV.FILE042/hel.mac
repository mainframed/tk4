              H E L -- A FULL-SCREEN HELP COMMAND FOR TSO

  THIS MEMBER USED TO CONTAIN THE SOURCE OF 'HEL'.
  'HEL' WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN BY BRUCE LELAND ON JUNE 18, 1984.
  IT WAS AN ADAPTION OF 'REVIEW' AS IT WAS AT THAT TIME.

  AS I HAVE ENHANCED 'REVIEW' SUBSTANTIALLY, I ALSO REFITTED SOME
  FIXES TO 'HEL' FROM CBT FILE 296 AND SUPPLIED THE RESULT IN
  CBT FILE 134 (THIS FILE).

  BRUCE HAS NOW INCLUDED THESE CHANGES INTO FILE 296, AND HAS
  CONTINUED TO DEBUG THE PROGRAM.

  I HAVE NOW COMPLETELY RETRO-FITTED THE FUNCTION OF 'HEL' ON TO
  'REVIEW'.  CONSEQUENTLY, AS FROM RELEASE 16 OF 'REVIEW', 'HEL'
  HAS BECOME AN ALIAS OF THE 'REVIEW' LOAD MODULE.

  SEE MEMBER 'REVINST' FOR INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS.
