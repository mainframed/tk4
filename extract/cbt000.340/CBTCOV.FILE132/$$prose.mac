           7 APR 83 - DON MARQUARDT, MAY & SPEH, OAKBROOK, IL
                      (312) 620-8060 REPORTED THAT HE TRIED TO
                      INSTALL THE FILE USING THE MEMBER CALLED
                      'INSTALX' WHICH ESSENTIALLY USES SUPPLIED
                      MEMBERS OF OBJECT CODE. HE HAD TROUBLE, SO
                      USED THE MEMBER 'INSTALO' THAT FORCES YOU
                      TO REASSEMBLE EVERYTHING AND IT WORKED
                      WITH NO PROBLEMS. I HAVE NOT TRIED TO INSTALL
                      IT HERE, BUT DON SAYS IT GOES ON CLEAN IF
                      REASSEMBLE EVERYTHING.


            THE MACRO REFERENCE LIST IS A MODIFICATION TO THE
            IFOX00 ASSEMBLER WHICH PRODUCES A LISTING OF ALL
            MACRO AND COPY MODULE NAMES THAT THE ASSEMBLER
            READ FROM SYSLIB, ALONG WITH THE LIBRARY NUMBER,
            DSNAME, AND VOLUME WHERE THE MACRO WAS FOUND.

            THE LISTING APPEARS IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE EXTERNAL
            SYMBOL DICTIONARY LISTING.

            THE LISTING IS GENERATED ONLY IF THERE IS
            A 'MACREF' DD STATEMENT PRESENT. THE LISTING
            IS WRITTEN TO SYSPRINT, HOWEVER, SO THE 'MACREF' DD
            SHOULD BE DUMMY TO KEEP ALLOCATION OVERHEAD TO A
            MINIMUM, BECAUSE IT IS MERELY USED AS A SWITCH.

            THE LISTING IS SORTED BY MACRO NAME WITHIN LIBRARY.

            INSTALLATION REQUIRES TWO ASSEMBLIES (OPTIONAL, SINCE
            THE TWO OBJECT DECKS ARE PROVIDED), LINK-EDITING
            OF 4 MODULES, AND 3 SMALL ZAPS TO ONE MODULE.

            DURING INSTALLATION, MODULE 'AFOX00' IS CREATED BY
            COPYING MODULE 'IFOX00', AND ZAPS ARE APPLIED TO
            'AFOX00'.  TO RUN TESTS AFTER INSTALLATION, YOU MUST
            EXECUTE 'AFOX00', NOT 'IFOX00'.  AFTER YOU ARE SATISFIED
            THAT IS WORKING, YOU MAY WANT TO APPLY THE ZAPS TO
            'IFOX00' TOO. (THIS IS SIMPLER THAN DELETING IFOX00
            AND RENAMING AFOX00 TO IFOX00, BECAUSE IFOX00 HAS
            ALIASES OF 'ASMBLR' AND 'IEUASM').

            IF YOU CHOOSE TO APPLY THE ZAPS TO 'IFOX00' ITSELF,
            THAT IS UP TO YOU.  IF YOU PREFER NOT TO DO THAT, YOU
            CAN STILL USE 'AFOX00', BECAUSE IT DOES NOT INTERFERE
            WITH THE UNMODIFIED 'IFOX00' AT ALL, EVEN IF THEY ARE
            BOTH IN THE SAME LOAD LIBRARY.

            DATA SETS REQUIRED DURING INSTALLATION.

            1) INSTALLATION SOURCE LIBRARY (YOU ARE READING
               A MEMBER OF IT).  THIS IS NAMED USERID.IFOLIB
               IN THE INSTALLATION JCL.  USED AS ASSEMBLER
               SYSIN AND SYSLIB.

            2) INSTALLATION LOAD LIBRARY, WHERE 4 LOAD MODULES
               ARE TO BE WRITTEN. THIS IS NAMES USERID.LOAD
               IN THE INSTALLATION JCL.  OUTPUT ONLY. YOU MAY
               CREATE A NEW LOAD LIBRARY OR USE ONE OF YOUR
               EXISTING LOAD LIBRARIES ON YOUR SYSTEM.

            3) OLD ASSEMBLER LOAD LIBRARY, WHERE YOU CURRENTLY
               HAVE YOUR ASSEMBLER.  THIS IS NEEDED FOR INPUT ONLY
               DURING LINKEDIT.  INSTALLATION JCL USES SYS1.LINKLIB.

            DESCRIPTION OF SOURCE LIBRARY.
              MEMBER 'IFOX0F' IS INPUT TO AN ASSEMBLY.
                      IT IS MODIFIED IBM SOURCE.
              MEMBER 'IFNX4E' IS INPUT TO AN ASSEMBLY.
                      IT IS MODIFIED IBM SOURCE.

              MEMBER 'OFOX0F' IS OBJECT OUTPUT FROM AN ASSEMBLY.
              MEMBER 'OFNX4E' IS OBJECT OUTPUT FROM AN ASSEMBLY.

              MEMBER 'MACREFBL' IS COPY CODE USED DURING AN ASSEMBLY.
              MEMBER 'MACREFGM' IS COPY CODE USED DURING AN ASSEMBLY.
              MEMBER 'MACREFFI' IS COPY CODE USED DURING AN ASSEMBLY.
              MEMBER 'MACREF4E' IS COPY CODE USED DURING AN ASSEMBLY.
                     THESE 4 ARE ALL NEW CODE, NOT FROM IBM.

              MEMBER 'XDICT' IS A MODIFIED VERSION OF THE MACRO
                     FROM THE MVS PRIVATE MACROS LIBRARY.

              MEMBER 'LINKIN' IS LINKAGE EDITOR CONTROL STATEMENTS.
              MEMBER 'ZAPIN' IS AMASPZAP CONTROL STATEMENTS.
              MEMBER 'INSTALL' IS INSTALLATION JCL USING SOURCE DECKS.
              MEMBER 'INSTALO' IS INSTALLATION JCL USING OBJECT DECKS.
              MEMBER '$DOC' IS DOCUMENTATION YOU ARE READING.

              ALL OTHER MEMBERS ARE UNMODIFIED IBM SOURCE,
                     MACROS FROM THE MVS PRIVATE MACROS LIBRARY.

           3 ZAPS TO AFOX00
           VER 0414 E7F0F4, REP 0414 E7E7F4.  IFOX04 TO IFOXX4.
           VER 043A E7F4F1, REP 043A E7F4C1.  IFOX41 TO IFOX4A.
           VER 0441 E7F4F2, REP 0441 E7F4C2.  IFOX42 TO IFOX4B.

           THE IBM SOURCE CODE FOR IFOX0F HAS BEEN KEEP UP TO
           DATE LOCALLY BY MODIFING OLDER IBM SOURCE CODE.
           THE OTHER IBM SOURCE CODE IS OF UNDETERMINED LEVEL.

           MOST RECENT CHANGE: PTF UZ32460 (8010) TO IFOX0F.

           TO COMPARE THE CODE WITH THE CURRENT IBM SOURCE
           (ON MICROFICHE FOR EXAMPLE), CHANGE THE 'SETB'
           FOR &MACREF TO ZERO (IN IFOX0F AND XDICT) AND ASSEMBLE.
           THIS WILL PRODUCE AN ASSEMBLY WITHOUT THE MODIFICATIONS,
           WHICH YOU CAN COMPARE TO THE MICROFICHE OR TO AN AMASPZAP
           DUMP OF YOUR CURRENT UNMODIFIED ASSEMBLER.

           IN THE MODIFIED VERSION OF THE ASSEMBLER,
           -   MODULE AFOX00 REPLACES IFOX00 (BUT YOU CAN CALL IT
              IFOX00 IF YOU CHOOSE TO REPLACE IFOX00).
           -   MODULE IFOXX4 IS USED INSTEAD OF IFOX04,
           -   MODULE IFOX4A IS USED INSTEAD OF IFOX41,
           -   MODULE IFOX4B IS USED INSTEAD OF IFOX42.

           IFOX41/4A IS USED WHEN THE 'TEST' OPTION IS NOT SPECIFIED.
           IFOX42/4B IS USED WHEN THE 'TEST' OPTION IS SPECIFIED.
           THE MODULE PRODUCED BY THE ASSEMBLY OF IFOX4E IS
           LINK-EDITED INTO BOTH IFOX4A AMD IFOX4B.
