 PDS COMMAND -- VERSION 7.3 -- INSTALLATION


 Note: This member should be printed for use in the following PDS
       generation steps; also, read the installation steps that
       apply to you before you perform any of the following steps.

 A. PDS command and the HELP member

    1.  Select a name for the PDS command (assume PDSAA for the
        following) where the name is from 1 to 8 characters long.

    2.  Edit member PDSGEN73 to set PDS global assembler variables
        according to instructions in the PDSGEN73 member.  Also,
        note the conventions used in PDSGEN73:
        a.  The default value for each operand is coded first.
        b.  For those variables which have common alternatives, their
            values are coded next as comments.
        c.  If you wish to use one of these alternatives, you need
            only convert the comment line to a valid SETC value;
            you do not need to modify the earlier default line.
        d.  It is recommended that you do not modify the default
            line; then, if you need to regenerate PDS later, the
            list of possible choices will still be available.

    3.  Edit member PDSHELP as follows:
        a.  An undocumented operand of the COMPRESS subcommand (SHR)
            can be used to compress data sets which are already
            allocated.  Document this operand if you want it used
            at your installation.
        b.  Replace all occurances of PDS45678 by PDSAA (note the
            capital letters).
        c.  Make any required changes for nullified or renamed
            subcommands (from the PDSGEN73 &N... SETC statements).
        d.  Make any required changes for invoked TSO commands or
            CLISTS (from the PDSGEN73 &C... SETC statements).
        e.  Save the changed HELP member into 'SYS1.HELP(PDSAA)'
            or a concatenated SYSHELP library as member PDSAA.
        f.  Note: a HELP print program is provided; see member PDSHJCL.

    4.  Edit member PDSJCL as follows before submitting:
        a.  Add a JOB statement.
        b.  To use the OS/VS assembler, change IEV90 to IFOX00 (Note:
            for MVS/XA, use IEV90 since a BASSM is in the CVT MACRO).
        c.  Change the installation library name.
        d.  Change the link library name.
        e.  Change the SYSLMOD member name from PDS45678 to PDSAA.

    5.  Test PDSAA (do not use ISPMODE or MEMLIST until later)

    6.  If PDS subcommands receive 806 ABENDS (for modules such as
        COMPARE, DSPRINT, FSE, HEL, LIST, PRINTOFF, RELEASE, REVIEW,
        SPFCOPY and VPSPRINT), it is probably because options in
        member PDSGEN73 were not matched with your installation.
        You should either install any missing TSO commands or fix
        the incorrect options in PDSGEN73 and reassemble PDS.

    7.  To install a subcommand or TSO command authorization exit,
        see member $$$SECUR.
1B.  SPF/ISPF interface notes:

     1.  The SPF interface consists of the PDS subcommands, BROWSE,
         EDIT, ISPF, ISPMODE and MEMLIST which request SPF services
         from the PDS command.

     2.  If PDS is invoked as an SPF dialog from an SPF selection panel,
         SPF services can be used without restrictions.

     3.  For ISPF Version 1:  ISPF services can not be used when PDS
         is invoked from ISPF option 6 or from the ISPF TSO command.

     4.  For ISPF Version 2:  ISPF services can be used without
         restrictions when PDS is invoked from ISPF option 6 or
         from the ISPF TSO command.

     5.  If PDS is not invoked from an SPF select panel:
         a.  SPF services can not be used when PDS is invoked from
             another TSO command if SPF is already active.
         b.  If PDS is invoked from READY mode or from another TSO
             command (and SPF is not already active) and the first
             BROWSE, EDIT, ISPF, ISPMODE, MEMLIST or OUTCOPY subcommand
             or CONTROL subcommand with a SYSOUT or DSNAME operand is
             entered, PDS attaches SPF and directs SPF to call PDS
             recursively as a dialog; thereafter, SPF services are
             invoked directly.
         c.  If your installation does not have SPF at all sites, you
             may wish to generate a copy of PDS without SPF support
             for those sites without SPF; then, error messages will
             not be produced when the OUTCOPY subcommand is used or
             when the CONTROL subcommand is used with its SYSOUT or
             DSNAME operands.

     6.  If the SPF or ISPF program products will co-exist at your
         installation, generate PDS for the oldest level to be used.

     7.  A difference between the SPF and the ISPF versions of
         this program are the lines labelled ISPF and ISPPANEL
         as follows from members @PDSMAIN and @SUBS:
         a.  For SPF:  "ISPF ...    PARM(++12345678)              "
                       "ISPPANEL ... PANEL(ISP@PRIM)              "
         b.  For ISPF: "ISPF ...    PARM(++12345678) NEWAPPL(ISR) "
                       "ISPPANEL ... PANEL(ISR@PRIM) NEWAPPL(ISR) "

     8.  These lines could be modified by reassembling PDS with a
         different value for &CISP or with a zap program of some kind.

     9.  If NEWAPPL(ISR) is present on a call to SPF, error messages
         will be issued and PDS will not allow any further SPF
         services to be used.

    10.  If NEWAPPL(ISR) is not present on a call to ISPF, the default
         values of ISPF's PF keys will be in effect for the PDS/ISPF
         session.

    11.  When a BROWSE, EDIT, ISPF, ISPMODE or MEMLIST subcommand
         is entered, asterisks may first appear below the entered
         subcommand; this is VTAM's page protection -- the enter key
         must be pushed to get the first SPF screen displayed.
1C.  If you have ISPF and ISPF/PDF (Version 1 or Version 2):

     1.  &CISP should have been set to 'ISPF' or 'ISPFV2' for the
         assembly of PDS; the generated code is no longer identical.

     2.  For ISPF Version 1, extended return (X or =X and an enter key)
         or just a return key may cause a problem if a BROWSE or
         EDIT subcommand is terminated by one of these return
         methods and an ISPF subcommand is entered.

         The symptom is that the ISPF subcommand will appear to
         be ignored but subsequent uses of the ISPF subcommand
         work correctly.  See APAR OZ72295 and PTF UZ67850 on 8401.

     3.  For ISPF Version 1 and Version 2, the reverse situation may
         also cause a problem.  For example, if an ISPF subcommand
         is terminated by one of the return methods, the next BROWSE
         or EDIT subcommand will appear to be ignored; however, if the
         subcommand is repeated, the condition clears.  Set &RETURNX
         to 'YES' in PDSGEN73 to circumvent this problem; this should
         treat RETURN like END in the ISPF subcommands.

     4.  Do NOT renumber the ISPF panels

     5.  Edit member P73PN@P  changing PDS73 to PDSAA

     6.  Edit member PDSPJCL, change data set names and submit to
         copy panel and message members into your ISPF data sets.

     7.  The primary panel for any version of PDS should be aliased as
         PDS@PRIM.  During testing, P73PN@P should be used to invoke
         PDS version 7.3.

         To place PDS version 7.3 into production, the following PDS
         subcommands should be entered:
           delete pds@prim
           alias  p73pn@p  pds@prim

     8.  If you have not already changed to the PDS@PRIM method,
         change a panel to call PDS@PRIM with either of the following
         methods after taking appropriate backups:
         a.  For the primary options menu, view the two change lines
             in member ISPFPRIM and make corresponding changes in
             'ISR.V1R1M0.ISRPLIB(ISR@PRIM)' -- your primary panel.
             For the example in member ISPFPRIM, the PDS@PRIM panel
             would be invoked by entering pds from the primary
             options panel or by entering =pds from any other panel.
         b.  For the utility menu (option 3), view the two change
             lines in member ISPFUTIL and make corresponding changes
             in 'ISR.V1R1M0.ISRPLIB(ISRUTIL)'.
             For the example in member ISPFUTIL, the PDS@PRIM panel
             would be invoked by entering p from the utility options
             panel or by entering =3.p from any other panel.

     9.  Exit from ISPF

    10.  Test ISPF and PDSAA (including ISPMODE and MEMLIST)
1D.  If you have SPF (5668-009):

     1.  &CISP should have been set to 'SPF' for the assembly of PDS.

     2.  As with ISPF, extended return (X or =X and the return key) or
         just the return key may cause PDS to ignore BROWSE, EDIT or
         ISPF subcommands.  You should research APAR OZ72295 for
         possible fixes for this situation.  &RETURNX should be set
         to 'YES' as in ISPF to circumvent some problems with this.

     3.  Note: if any BROWSE, ISPF or EDIT subcommand is terminated by
         any option request (=1, =2, ...) and the return key, the PDS
         END subcommand may result in a S30A ABEND.  PTF UZ61659 and
         its co-requisite, UZ61864, from the 8304 PUT tape should fix
         this problem.

     4.  If you have previously installed the SPF entry panel for PDS,
         you need not repeat steps 5 through 7 as the materials have
         not changed for this release of PDS.

     5.  Do NOT renumber the SPF panels

     6.  Copy member SPFMSGS into 'ISP.R1M0.ISPMLIB(PDSM00)' or any
         message library (ISPMLIB) data set.

     7.  Edit member SPFSEL changing all PDS45678 to PDSAA and copy the
         changed member into 'ISP.R1M0.ISPPLIB(PDSSEL)' or any panel
         library (ISPPLIB) data set.

     8.  Change a panel to call PDSSEL with either of the following
         methods after taking appropriate backups:
         a.  For the primary options menu, view the two change lines
             in member SPFPRIM and make corresponding changes in
             'ISP.R1M0.ISPPLIB(ISP@PRIM)' -- your primary panel.
             For the example in member SPFPRIM, the PDSSEL panel
             would be invoked by entering pds from the primary
             options panel or by entering =pds and PF key 4 from
             any other panel.
         b.  For the utility menu (option 3), view the two change
             lines in member SPFUTIL and make corresponding changes
             in 'ISP.R1M0.ISPPLIB(ISPUTIL)'.
             For the example in member SPFUTIL, the PDSSEL panel
             would be invoked by entering p from the utility
             options panel or by entering =3.p and PF key 4 from
             any other panel.

     9.  ISPMODE and MEMLIST are not supported for SPF.

    10.  Exit from SPF

    11.  Test SPF and PDSAA (note: the PDS panel does not have any
         memory across SPF sessions as it does for ISPF sessions).
