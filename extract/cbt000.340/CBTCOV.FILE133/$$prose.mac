                 RELEASE    1      24 JULY 1984


            THIS IS THE SOURCE FILE TO ASSEMBLE A PROGRAM CALLED
           'CATPTPCH'. I OBTAINED IT FROM THE OS/MVT PROJECT TAPE WHEN
           I WAS ON OS/MVT. IT WILL ALLOW YOU TO OFFLOAD YOUR OS
           CATALOGS IN IEHPROGM PROGRAM FORMAT CONTROL CARDS. IT DOES
           ALL THE BLDG'S ETC NECESSARY TO REBUILD THE CATALOG. TRUE
           THERE ARE NICE NEAT PROGRAMS TO DO COPIES OF CATALOGS ETC.
           BUT THERE IS JUST SOMETHING THAT GIVES YOU A WARM FEELING
           IN THE BOTTOM OF YOUR STOMACH WHEN YOU CAN SEE THE CATALOG
           REPRODUCED IN IEHPROGM CONTROL CARDS.

            WE HAVE ADDED THE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR ALL 3330 DEVICES
            3350'S. IT HAS SOME OTHER
            FUNCTIONS THAT ARE EXPLAINED IN THE MEMBER $DOC. THE CODE
            IS IN THE FORM OF MACROS AND I HAVE PUT A MEMBER CALLED
            $INSTALL TO DEMONSTRATE THE JCL REQUIRED FOR AN ASSEMBLY.
            I WANT TO THANK DARRELL WILCOX OF KING COUNTY SYSTEMS FOR
            THE ORIGINAL CODE.  GOOD LUCK !!!!!

            AS AN ADDED WORD HERE. I BELIEVE YOU WILL SEE THE SYSTEM
           ON THE MACRO FOR GENERATING THE CODE. WHEN IT WAS ORIGINALLY
           CODED I THINK 'SYSTEM=370' MEANT TO INCLUDE 370 INSTRUCTIONS.
           I TRIED THE CODE AND IT BLEW. SO I INTEND THE MEANING TO BE
           'SYSTEM=360' TO BE FOR OS/MVT ON 360'S AND 370'S. AND
           'SYSTEM=370' TO MEAN OS/MVS. I HAVE ONLY DONE THE FUNCTIONS
           TO PRINT THE CATALOG OFF OR PUNCH IT OFF. WILL PROBABLY
           CONTINUE TO PLAY WITH IT. IF YOU DISCOVER ANY BUGS, PLEASE
           SEND ME THE CORRECTIONS.
