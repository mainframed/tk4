.*        DCSPARS - INNER MACRO FOR THE 'DCS' MACRO                   *

.*        DATE UPDATED. MARCH 17 1982.                                *
.*                                                                    *
.*        THIS MACRO TAKES A OPERAND THAT IS 2 NUMBERS IN             *
.*        PARENTHESES AND RETURNS THE TWO NUMBERS IN GLOBALS          *
.*                                                                    *
.*        THIS IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE DCS MACRO IS                  *
.*        REFERENCING ITS OPERANDS AS &SYSLIST(N), AND IF             *
.*        ONE OF THE OPERANDS IS A LIST OF VALUES IN PARENTHESES      *
.*        YOU WOULD THINK THAT YOU COULD REFERENCE THE FIRST VALUE    *
.*        AS &SYSLIST(N)(1) AND THE SECOND AS &SYSLIST(N)(2).         *
.*        BUT NOOOOOOOO, THE ASSEMBLER WONT ALLOW THAT.               *
.*        SO THE DCS MACRO ISSUES THIS MACRO WITH &SYSLIST(N)         *
.*        AS THE OPERAND, AND THIS MACRO CAN REFER TO THE             *
.*        VALUES WITHIN THE PARENTHESES BECAUSE IT DOES NOT           *
.*        USE &SYSLIST(N) BUT JUST &OPERAND.                          *
.*                                                                    *
