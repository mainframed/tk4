 Development Tools is a package of three ISPF Dialog Applications.


 SCAN PDS

 SCANPDS builds  a full or  partial PDS  Member List for  a partitioned
 dataset or  a concatenation  of up to  4 PDS's.    PDS members  in the
 Member List may be limited to those with a generic name,  and/or those
 with a certain (or generic)  userid in ISPF member statistics,  and/or
 those members  satisfying a search for  a character string  within the
 member (hence the name SCAN PDS).

 From  the Member  List display,   members  may be  selected for  Edit,
 Browse, Rename, Delete, Print, Move/Copy,  Zap (delete the member from
 the display),  Submit and Directory dump.   In addition,  commands are
 available  from the  command line  that manipulate  the entire  Member
 List.  These are Top, Locate, Find (find a Userid in ISPF statistics),
 RFIND,   Sort,   Left/Right  (scroll  commands),   Info  (get  dataset
 information,  i.e.,  PDF  3.2-like information),  SWitch (switch  to a
 Member List for a new PDS),  STack (stack  a Member List on top of the
 current  one),   Scan (scan  the  members  currently displayed  for  a
 character  string),  Rebuild  (reconstruct  the  Member List  for  the
 current dataset(s)), and Mode (see below).   Also, Many of the command
 line  commands except  a  generic member  name  operand  so that  they
 operate on  many PDS  members consecutively.    Finally,  member  list
 contruction by SCAN PDS  is up to twice as fast  as the ISPF generated
 member lists of Browse, Edit and Library Utility.


 Menu Replacement for Browse/Edit

 In addition,  the  necessary panels and a driver  program are included
 which allow you to use the full capability of the Member List provided
 by  SCAN PDS  for  ISPF Browse  and Edit.    This  is called  Enhanced
 Browse/Edit.   This can be a direct replacement for Browse/Edit if you
 choose.   The advantages are faster member list construction, multiple
 selects,   generic member  name  specification,   generic member  name
 commands  from  the  command  line,    and  additional  commands  from
 Browse/Edit member lists (such as Sort,  Info,  SWitch,  STack,  Scan,
 REBuild), and Mode.  The Mode command allows you to change between any
 of the 3 types of member  lists--Browse,  Edit or full-function Member
 List (described above).


 FSLISTC

 FSLISTC (Full-Screen  LIST Catalog)  builds  a full-screen  display of
 information for cataloged datasets for  a given Catalog Prefix.   It's
 function is similar to the Version  2 PDF 3.4 option.   The difference
 is that  the Catalog List  construction is  about twice as  fast,  the
 Catalog information is in an easier to read form, multiple selects are
 possible, and Enhanced Browse/Edit is used to Browse/Edit the datasets
 listed.  Other operations that can be done on the datasets listed are:
 Member List (to build a full-function  member list as above),  Rename,
 Delete,  Locate,  Compress/Release  and Zap (remove the  line from the
 List).    (Certain functions  available in  PDF  3.4 are  not used  in
 FSLISTC, namely, Catalog/UnCatalog,  Dataset information,  and Print).
 In addition,  Command  line commands available include  Sort,  Switch,
 Stack,  Top  and Clear,  all  analagous to the  corresponding commands
 detailed above.


 FSLISTA

 FSLISTA (Full-Screen LIST  Allocate)  builds a full-screen  display of
 DDnames that are allocated to the TSO session.  (The information given
 is similar to  that of the TSO LISTALC Command  Processor,  except the
 information  is formatted  in an  easy to  read full-screen  display.)
 Commands available from the display include Enhanced Browse/Edit, Free
 (Free an allocated DDname),  Member List (build a full-function Member
 List for a single PDS), Concatenated Member List (build a concatenated
 Member List  for up  to 4  PDS's starting  at the  level given  by the
 Select Code),  Locate,  Clear (remove freed DDnames from the display),
 and Top.



 Each application has many other unique  and useful features,  and each
 require ISPF Version  2.   Complete documentation is  provided in ISPF
 Tutorial  Panels (there  are  57 of  them).   A  menu  is provided  to
 demonstrate the  invocation of  each application.    All programs  are
 reentrant and reuseable,  and therefore can be installed in the LPA if
 desired.
