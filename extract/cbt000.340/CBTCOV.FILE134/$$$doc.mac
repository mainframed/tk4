                         PROGRAMS

THERE IS A MORE DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ALL THESE PROGRAMS IN THE
BEGINNING OF THE CODE:
MEMBER    DESCRIPTION
FOLDIT    PROGRAM FOR PRINTING DATA SETS WITH UPPER AND LOWER
          CASE CHARACTERS ON PRINTERS LACKING THE LUXURY OF LOWER CASE.
SMFSEL    THIS PROGRAM COPIES ONE SMF HISTORY TAPE TO ANOTHER BUT ALLOWS
          SELECTION  BY DATE (JULIAN) AND TIME (MILITARY 24 HR CLOCK).
          (FIXED BUG WITH DATE SELECTION)
DLXSUBMT  PROGRAM USED HERE AS A STC TO PROVIDE RACF PASSWORDS FOR
          OPERATIONS JOBS (PASSWORD DECRYPTION ROUTINE IS NOT MINE BUT
          IT DOES WORK FOR ANY LENGTH PASSWORD. I DO NOT PROFESS TO
          UNDERSTAND IT AND I HAVE CONVENIENTLY FORGOTTEN THE FINE
          GENTLEMAN WHO PROVIDED IT TO ME)
IKJEFF10  DOES APPROXIMATELY THE SAME THING AS DLXSUBMT EXCEPT IS THE
          A TSO SUBMIT EXIT. HAS A COUPLE OF MINOR LIMITATIONS, MAINLY
          THAT THE PASSWORD FIELD MUST HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME NUMBER OF
          QUESTION MARKS AS THE USERS PASSWORD HAS CHARACTERS. IF ANY
          ON FIXES THAT PLEASE GIVE ME A CALL I AM SHORT OF TIME.
DLXPOST   SLOPPY BUT IT DOES ALLOW PRINTING OF MOST PRINT TYPE FILES ON
          A 6670 USING OCL FROM SYSIN. (DOCUMENTATION IS CURRENTLY A
          LITTLE DEFICIENT)

     NOTE ON THE CLISTS:
        MOST OF THE PROGRAMS USED IN THE CLISTS ARE EXECUTED VIA
        THE "$" COMMAND WHICH SIMPLY USES THE PROGRAM FROM THE LINKLIST.
        THIS COULD BE CHANGED TO "CALL 'LIBRARY(PROGRAM)'" IF YOU WISH.
        ALSO IF THE COMMAND IS NOT STANDARD IBM IT IS PROBABLY ON THE
        CBT TAPE SOMEWHERE.
