This file should be processed by IEBUPDTE and will create the following
members:

   $README  -  What you are currently reading
   EXEC     -  IEBUPDTE input to your SYSEXEC (REXX procedure)
               library
   PANELS   -  IEBUPDTE input to your ISPF Panels library

Both EXEC and PANELS must have +/ change to ./ before being processed by
IEBUPDTE into their appropriate target libraries.

Below is the brief documentation on the CUT and PASTE ISPF Edit Macros:

 CUT is a REXX ISPF edit macro to copy or move lines from the current
 edit session and place them in a shared ISPF table. The PASTE macro
 will copy or move the data into another edit session.  See the
 tutorial starting with panel #CUT for further information.

 CUT <REPLACE > <TABLE table> <NX> <col-1 col-2> <COPY> <range>
     <EXTEND  >               <X >               <MOVE>
     <SHOW    >
     <DELETE  >
     <PROMPT  >
     <PROFILE >
     <HELP × ?>


 PASTE is a REXX ISPF edit macro to copy or move lines from a shared
 ISPF table into the current edit session. The table must have
 previously been created by the CUT macro.  See the tutorial starting
 with panel #CUT for further information.    Syntax:

 PASTE <COPY  > <TABLE table> <AT at> <col-1 col-2> <AFTER>   <range>
       <MOVE  >                                     <BEFORE>
       <HELP×?>                                     <OVERLAY>
       <PROMPT>
