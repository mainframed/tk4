       INTRODUCTION

       THE TIME  SHARING  SUBSYSTEM  OPTION  (TSSO)  IS  A  PACKAGE
       DESIGNED  TO  INCREASE OPERATIONS PRODUCTIVITY BY AUTOMATING
       OPERATIONAL TASKS WHICH  ARE  NORMALLY  PERFORMED  MANUALLY.
       THIS  DOCUMENT DESCRIBES THE CHANGES TO TSSO IN RELEASE 4.1.
       KNOWLEDGE OF TSSO CONCEPTS IS ASSUMED.1

       ENHANCEMENTS_TO_THE_OPERATOR_PRODUCTIVITY_FACILITY_(OPF)

       THE FOLLOWING IMPROVEMENTS WERE MADE TO THE OPF COMPONENT OF
       TSSO.

         1.  THE  "*COM"  FACILITY  FOR  ISSUING  MVS  COMMANDS  IS
             IMPROVED  WITH  THE ABILITY TO SPECIFY A DELAY TIME OF
             BETWEEN 1 AND 999 SECONDS. THE PREVIOUS  LIMIT  WAS  9
             SECONDS.  THIS  SHOULD  ASSIST  INSTALLATIONS WITH THE
             TIMING OF TSSO TASKS.

** NOTE: TSSO WILL NOW PAUSE BEFORE EXECUTION OF THE COMMAND, NOT
** AFTER THE COMMAND AS IN PREVIOUS RELEASES. THIS IS AN
** INCOMPATABILITY.

         2.  A  "*HI"  FACILITY  HAS  BEEN  ADDED   TO   ALLOW   AN
             INSTALLATION  TO HIGHLIGHT MESSAGES PRODUCED BY A TSSO
             CLIST OR COMMAND ON THE MVS OPERATOR'S  CONSOLE.  TSSO
             WILL  HIGHLIGHT  ANY LINE THAT BEGINS WITH THE KEYWORD
             "*HI".

         3.  A  MAXWTO  PARAMETER  HAS  BEEN  ADDED  TO  THE   TSSO
             INITIALIZATION  DECK  TO  ALLOW  THE  INSTALLATION  TO
             SPECIFY THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF WTOS TO  BE  ISSUED  PER
             TSSO/OPF  COMMAND.  THE PREVIOUS VALUE WAS ARBITRARILY
             SET  AT  250.  THIS  NEW   PARAMETER   SHOULD   ASSIST
             INSTALLATIONS  EXPERIENCING  WTO BUFFER SHORTAGES AS A
             RESULT OF TSSO PROCESSING.

         4.  THE LENGTH OF RECORDS PRODUCED BY TSSO AND  COPIED  TO
             THE  OPERATOR'S  CONSOLE  IS  INCREASED  TO  125. THIS
             REPRESENTS THE MVS LIMIT FOR LENGTH OF A WTO  MESSAGE.

           TEMS PROGRAMMING REFERENCE GUIDE, 8/29/84












                                  - 2 -



             THE PREVIOUS VALUE WAS SET AT 80.

         5.  THE "#.L" FACILITY WILL NO  LONGER  RE-ISSUE  COMMANDS
             THAT  WERE IN THE SYSTSPRT OUTPUT STREAM. INSTEAD, THE
             LINE WILL BE WRITTEN  TO  THE  MVS  CONSOLE  WITH  THE
             "*COM"   REPLACED  WITH  "*DUP".  NOTE  THAT  MESSAGES
             PREFIXED  WITH  THE   "*HI"   VERB   WILL   STILL   BE
             HIGHLIGHTED.  THIS  ENHANCEMENT  ALLOWS AN OPERATOR TO
             ISSUE THE "#.L" COMMAND TO DETERMINE WHAT MVS COMMANDS
             WERE  ISSUED  AS  A  RESULT  OF  THE LAST TSSO COMMAND
             EXECUTED.

         6.  THE TSSO RACF SUPPORT IS IMPROVED WITH THE ABILITY FOR
             TSSO TO EXECUTE TSO COMMANDS WITH THE AUTHORITY OF THE
             USERID  SPECIFIED   IN   THE   RACFID   INITIALIZATION
             PARAMETER. PREVIOUSLY, THIS PARAMETER HAD NO EFFECT.

         7.  THE RACFID PARAMETER CAN NO LONGER BE SPECIFIED BY THE
             CONSOLE  OPERATOR AT TSSO INITIALIZATION TIME. THIS IS
             TO INCREASE SECURITY OF THE TSSO SUBSYSTEM.

       ENHANCEMENTS_TO_THE_AUTOMATED_OPERATIONS_FACILITY_(TSSO/AOF)

       THE  FOLLOWING  IMPROVEMENTS  WERE  MADE  TO  THE  AUTOMATED
       OPERATIONS FACILITY (AOF) COMPONENT OF TSSO.

         1.  THE SINGLE BIGGEST CHANGE MADE TO TSSO IN THIS RELEASE
             IS  THE  ADDITION OF A "TEST" KEYWORD IN THE AOF TABLE
             TABENTRY MACRO. THIS ALLOWS THE INSTALLATION TO DIRECT
             TSSO  TO TEST CERTAIN WORDS OR COLUMN POSITIONS OF THE
             MVS MESSAGE BEFORE DECIDING TO EXECUTE  THE  DIRECTIVE
             SPECIFIED IN THE ACTION= PARAMETER. FOR EXAMPLE,

 TABENTRY  MSG=$HASP395,ACTION=HILIGHT,TEST=(('W',3,7,'PAYROLL',' '))

             WILL DIRECT TSSO/AOF TO HIGHLIGHT THE $HASP395 MESSAGE
             (JOB  XXXXXXXX  ENDED)  ONLY  IF THE THIRD WORD IN THE
             MESSAGE  (THE  XXXXXXXX)  IS  'PAYROLL'.  THIS  VASTLY
             IMPROVES  THE  POTENTIAL OF TSSO/AOF TO ELIMINATE MANY
             OPERATIONAL  PROCEDURES  THAT   ARE   DEPENDENT   UPON
             WATCHING THE MVS OPERATOR'S CONSOLE FOR MESSAGES.  THE
             TEST  CAPABILITY  CAN  BE  USED   WITH   ANY   ACTION=
             DIRECTIVE.  CURRENTLY,  THIS  INCLUDES  OSCMD, OSCMDT,
             REPLY, HILIGHT, LOWLIGHT AND SUPPRESS.  IF  MORE  THEN
             ONE  TEST  CONDITION  IS SPECIFIED ON A GIVEN TABENTRY
             MACRO, ALL CONDITIONS MUST BE  MET  BEFORE  TSSO  WILL
             PERFORM  THE  INSTRUCTION  SPECIFIED  IN  THE  ACTION=
             PARAMETER. THIS REPRESENTS A LOGICAL "AND"  CONDITION.
             TO  ACHIEVE  A  LOGICAL "OR" CONDITION FOR TWO OR MORE
             TESTS, AN  INSTALLATION  MAY  CODE  MULTIPLE  TABENTRY
             MACROS  SPECIFYING  THE  SAME  MSG,  ACTION  AND  TEXT











                                  - 3 -



             PARAMETERS, BUT WITH DIFFERENT TEST CONDITIONS.

         2.  A NEW CAPABILITY WAS ADDED TO THE  MSG=  KEYWORD.  THE
             MSG=*   SPECIFICATION  CAUSES  TSSO  TO  SELECT  EVERY
             MESSAGE FOR PROCESSING. BY ITSELF, THIS CAPABILITY  IS
             NOT  THAT  USEFUL,  BUT  IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE TEST=
             KEYWORD, THIS CAPABILITY ALLOWS FOR MESSAGE  SELECTION
             BASED NOT ONLY ON SPECIFIC MESSAGE IDENTIFIERS, BUT ON
             GENERIC IDENTIFIERS AS WELL. BY SPECIFYING MSG=*  WITH
             TEST=  OPERANDS THAT TEST CHARACTERS IN THE MESSAGE ID
             ITSELF (I.E. THE FIRST "WORD" OR THE FIRST 8 CHARACTER
             POSITIONS), GENERIC MESSAGE IDS CAN BE SELECTED.

         3.  AN ACTION=SUPPRESS  KEYWORD  HAS  BEEN  ADDED  TO  THE
             TSSO/AOF  TABENTRY  MACRO. THIS ACTION= DIRECTIVE WILL
             CAUSE TSSO/AOF TO SUPPRESS ALL WTO MESSAGES  WITH  THE
             MESSAGE ID SPECIFIED IN THE MSG PARAMETER OF THE MACRO
             (PROVIDED  ALL  CONDITIONS  SPECIFIED  IN  THE   TEST=
             KEYWORD ARE MET).

         4.  AN  ACTION=LOWLIGHT  PARAMETER  HAS  BEEN  ADDED.  THE
             PARAMETER WILL CAUSE TSSO/AOF TO CHANGE THE DESCRIPTOR
             CODES  OF   HIGHLIGHTED   MESSAGES   SUCH   THAT   THE
             HIGHLIGHTING  DOES NOT OCCUR. IT IS POSSIBLE TO CHANGE
             WTOR MESSAGES IN  THIS  WAY  SO  THEY  ARE  NO  LONGER
             HIGHLIGHTED,  AND  DO  NOT  STAY  ON  THE SCREEN. THIS
             PARAMETER CAN BE OF ASSISTANCE  TO  INSTALLATIONS  WHO
             RUN   MANY   PRODUCTS  THAT  LEAVE  OUTSTANDING  WTORS
             THROUGHOUT THE DAY. THE TSSO REPLY COMMAND CAN BE USED
             TO REPLY TO THESE OUTSTANDING WTORS.

         5.  A NEW TSSO COMMAND, DISPAOF ALLOWS THE INSTALLATION TO
             QUERY  INFORMATION  ABOUT TSSO/AOF TABLES. INFORMATION
             CAN BE OBTAINED FOR EITHER THE RUNNING TSSO/AOF TABLE,
             OR  A  NEW TSSO/AOF TABLE RESIDING ON DISK. THE SYNTAX
             OF THE DISPAOF COMMAND IS:

                DISPAOF  MSG(MSG-ID) TABLE(TABLE-ID) TEST


         6.  LASTLY, A NEW TSSO/AOF TABLE STRUCTURE  WAS  PUT  INTO
             PLACE, WHICH INCLUDES THE TSSO VERSION IDENTIFIER, AND
             A USER SPECIFIABLE ID THAT APPEARS ON THE OUTPUT  FROM
             THE "#.QT" COMMAND.

       TSO_COMMAND_ENHANCEMENTS_UNDER_TSSO

       SOME CHANGES AND ADDITIONS WERE MADE  TO  THE  TSO  COMMANDS
       DISTRIBUTED WITH TSSO.













                                  - 4 -



         1.  THE CACHE COMMAND WILL NOW ALLOW THE SPECIFICATION  OF
             THE  VOLSER,  IN  ADDITION  TO  THE UCB, FOR THE CACHE
             DEVICE BEING ACCESSED.

         2.  A  NEW  COMMAND,  "CPCMD",  ALLOWS  THE  MVS   CONSOLE
             OPERATOR  RUNNING  UNDER VM/SP, VM/SP HPO, OR VM/XA TO
             ISSUE CP COMMANDS, AND GET  THE  RESPONSE  BACK.  THIS
             COMMAND IS USEFUL TO INSTALLATIONS WISHING TO MINIMIZE
             THE OPERATIONAL IMPACT OF RUNNING  MVS  IN  A  VIRTUAL
             MACHINE.

         3.  THE SPMON COMMAND IS NOW COMPATIBLE WITH MVS/XA 2.1.2.
             THIS  RELEASE  CHANGED  THE MVS ASVT/ASCB STRUCTURE TO
             SUPPORT THE RSVNONR AND  RSVSTRT  PARAMETERS  SO  THAT
             SOME   PROGRAMS   THAT  SCANNED  THESE  CONTROL  BLOCK
             STRUCTURES FAILED TO OPERATE. THE SPMON  COMMAND  WILL
             ALSO DISPLAY THE NUMBER OF INACTIVE INITIATORS.

       MISCELLANEOUS_ENHANCEMENTS

       FINALLY, MISCELLANEOUS CHANGES WERE  MADE  TO  TSSO  IN  THE
       FOLLOWING AREAS.

         1.  THE TSSOWTO MODULE WAS COMPLETELY REWRITTEN.  THE  RE-
             WRITE  SHOULD  PROVIDE  FOR EASE OF ABILITY TO PROCESS
             INFORMATION IN THE TSSO SYSTSPRT  INPUT  STREAM.  NOTE
             THAT  THE  REWRITE  IMPOSES A TSSO RESTRICTION IN THAT
             THE DCB CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SYSTSPRT FILE  MUST  BE
             LRECL=137,  DSORG=PS,  RECFM=FBA.  ANY  DEVIATION FROM
             THIS WILL CAUSE A TSSO ABEND.

         2.  THE INSTALLATION DOCUMENTATION FOR TSSO  IS  IMPROVED.
             SAMPLE   JOBS   ARE   PROVIDED   TO   ASSIST   IN  THE
             INSTALLATION.

         3.  THE TSSO SYSTEM PROGRAMMER  GUIDE  IS  MUCH  IMPROVED.
             EXAMPLES  OF  HOW  TO  CONSTRUCT  TSSO CLISTS, AND AOF
             TABLES ARE PROVIDED, AND  DOCUMENTATION  FOR  THE  TSO
             COMMANDS SUPPLIED WITH TSSO IS GIVEN.

         4.  TSSO PERFORMANCE WAS IMPROVED WITH THE RE-WRITE OF THE
             TSSOWTO  MODULE.  TSSO  NOW  OBTAINS 1 SECOND RESPONSE
             TIME FOR MOST TSO COMMANDS.

         5.  TSSO  HAS  BEEN  VERIFIED  TO  RUN  PROPERLY  ON   THE
             FOLLOWING SYSTEMS:

               A.  MVS/SP 1.3.3 WITHOUT TSO/E

               B.  MVS/SP 2.1.1 WITH TSO/E RELEASE 1












                                  - 5 -



               C.  MVS/SP 2.1.2 WITH TSO/E RELEASE 1

               D.  MVS/SP 2.1.2 WITH TSO/E RELEASE 2

               E.  MVS/SP 2.1.2 WITH TSO/E RELEASE 2.1

       THE READER IS S T R O N G L Y  URGED TO READ THE  TSSO  4.1  SYST
       PROGRAMMER  REFERENCE GUIDE, FOR INFORMATION ON USAGE OF THE
       NEW FACILITIES.

       CONCLUSION

       THIS DOCUMENT PROVIDES INFORMATION ON THE  ENHANCEMENTS  AND
       CHANGES  INCORPORATED  INTO RELEASE 4.1 OF THE TSSO PACKAGE.
