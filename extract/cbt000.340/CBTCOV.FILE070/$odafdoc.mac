                             Preface

The objective of this reference manual is to provide the
information necessary to plan for, install and use DAF in an MVS
environment.  Chapter 1 provides an introduction to DAF, chapter
2 documents the DAF installation process and chapter 3 details
the execution of DAF.

All references to jobs, are actually generic references to JES
units of work, which includes all MVS address spaces such as
APPC, batch jobs, started tasks and TSO users.

                    Chapter 1 - Introduction
                             Dilemma

Since the beginning of MVS, many operating system components and
program products have been using System Management Facility (SMF)
as a repository for an audit trail of dataset related
information.  Over the years, the size and scope of this audit
trail has grown dramatically as:

  Existing SMF records were enhanced
  Hardware and software throughput capacities increased
  New SMF records were introduced

In addition, the importance of the SMF audit trail has grown
significantly since the introduction of the DOD B1 security level
in MVS 3.1.3.  In this enhanced security environment, bottlenecks
in the SMF subsystem can cause MVS to go into a wait state,
requiring the use of the standalone dump program and an IPL of
MVS to recover.

However, MVS professionals are unable to use any of this
extensive audit trail because the industry lacked a facility to
access and process this dataset information.

DAF is an innovative and unique productivity tool that reveals
the mysteries hidden in your SMF records.

DAF uses technology to audit technology.  By scanning actual BDT,
DFSORT, JES2, NONVSAM, RACF, RMF, SMS and VSAM SMF records, DAF
tells you what really happened on the system.

  No more guessing.
  No more reliance on ten year old system flowcharts.
  No more cumbersome and error prone reviews of JCL statements
and RACF profiles.

DAF takes the mystery out of data processing!

                     Overview of Processing

The processing performed by DAF can be divided into four high
level phases:

1)   DAF determines the selection criteria of the SMF data from
the control statements encountered in the DAFCS DD statement.
Images of all control statements are copied to the log.  Error
messages are generated for all invalid control statements.  The
selection criteria is displayed in the log.

2)   DAF reads the SMF data from the DAFSMF DD statement, and
extracts only the SMF records which match the selection criteria.

3)   DAF sorts the extracted information.

4)   DAF creates the report and statistics application system
output datasets.

                           SMF Records

                    Chapter 2 - Installation
                     Installation Checklist

DAF installs in minutes and requires no IPL, system modifications
or hooks.

DAF is distributed on a personal computer based diskette that
contains the following files:

  Name    Description
  DAF.DOC Reference Manual in Word for Windows 2.0 Format
  DAF.EXE Execution JCL
  DAF.LNK Linkage Editor JCL
  DAF.OBJ Object Code
  DAF.RFT Reference Manual in RFT-DCA Format
  DAF.TXT Reference Manual in Text with Layout Format
  README  High Level Documentation

The following is an installation checklist that should be used
while installing DAF.

[    ]    Step 1  -  Validate SMF subsystem integrity

[    ]    Step 2  -  Upload product distribution files

[    ]    Step 3  -  Process the object module with the linkage
editor

[    ]    Step 4  -  Integrate DAF into the environment

[    ]    Step 5  -  Install SMF job initiation exit IEFUJI
(optional)

                     Installation Procedures

Step 1  -  Validate SMF subsystem integrity

Validate that the fixes for the IBM SMF related APAR's listed in
Appendix B are on your system.

Validate that all DAF supported SMF records are not modified or
suppressed by any SMF installation-written exit routines.  This
is controlled by the SMF initialization EXITS(include) and
NOEXITS(exclude) parameters in SYS1.PARMLIB(SMFPRMxx).
  Exit         Description
  IEFU83       SMF Record Exit (SVC Entry)
  IEFU84       SMF Record Exit (Branch Entry)
  IEFU85       SMF Record Exit (Cross Memory)
  IEFACTRT     Termination Exit
  IEFUJP       Job Purge Exit

Validate that all DAF supported SMF records are being written by
the SMF subsystem to the active SMF recording dataset.  This is
controlled by the SMF initialization TYPE(include) and
NOTYPE(exclude) parameters in SYS1.PARMLIB(SMFPRMxx).

Validate that all DAF supported SMF records are being dumped by
an IFASMFDP compatible utility program.  This is controlled by
the IFASMFDP SYSIN parameter OUTDD.  IFASMFDP installation-
written exit routines can suppress the dumping of SMF records.

Validate that users have read access to all SMF dump datasets
that contain DAF supported SMF records.

Validate the RMF initialization parameters in
SYS1.PARMLIB(ERBRMFxx) as described below:

Parameter      Function
ENQ(DETAIL)    Measure Detailed Enqueue Activity
INTERVAL(15M)  RMF Reporting Interval of 15 Minutes for greater
enqueue activity granularity
PAGESP      Measure Page/Swap Dataset Activity
RECORD      Write SMF Type 75 & 77 Records

Step 2  -  Upload product distribution files

Upload DAF.EXE, DAF.LNK and DAF.OBJ to the mainframe.

Note:
DAF.OBJ contains MVS object code and must be treated as binary
data during file transfer.  This means that DAF.OBJ should NOT be
translated from ASCII to EBCDIC when uploaded to the mainframe.
Due to linkage editor limitations, DAF.OBJ must be uploaded into
an LRECL=80, BLKSIZE=400 dataset.

DAF.EXE and DAF.LNK contain only text data.  This means that they
should be translated from ASCII to EBCDIC when uploaded to the
mainframe.

                     Installation Procedures

Step 3  -  Process the object module with the linkage editor

Submit DAF.LNK to make DAF executable.

  //ZT15$LNK JOB
(SZ0000),'DAF_LINK',CLASS=U,MSGCLASS=X,NOTIFY=ZT15
  //DAFLNK     EXEC PGM=IEWL,PARM='MAP,LET,LIST,RENT'
  //SYSLIN     DD        DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS2.DAF.V32.OBJ(DAF)
  //SYSLMOD DD   DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS2.DAF.V32.LINKLIB(DAF)
  //SYSUT1     DD        UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(CYL,(3,2)),DSN=&SYSUT1
  //SYSPRINT   DD        SYSOUT=*

Note:
SYSLIN is the MVS object code that was uploaded
(LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=400).
SYSLMOD is a load library (LRECL=0,BLKSIZE=32760).
If this job does not get a zero return code, save the output and
contact the vendor.

Step 4  -  Integrate DAF into the environment

Make the executable load library available to batch jobs through
MVS program management facilities such as JOBLIB, STEPLIB or Link
List (LNKLSTxx)

                     Installation Procedures

Step 5  -  Install SMF job initiation exit IEFUJI (optional)

Before performing this installation step, it is very important to
validate that no other modifications are being made to the User
Identification field of the SMF Common Exit Parameter Area.
Computer Associates has a job scheduler called CA-7 (formerly
UCC7) that, depending on installation options, can store a one
byte flag in either the User Identification, Reader Date or
Reader Time fields of the SMF Common Exit Parameter Area.

To fully exploit the Text Scanning Keywords USER, this optional
installation step must be performed.  The sole purpose of this
installation step is to populate the User Identification field of
the SMF Common Exit Parameter Area with the USERID from the ACEE.
This is done because SMF will then place this USERID in all
subsequent SMF records for the life of that particular job.
There are a few different ways of accomplishing this, but this
seems to be the most straight forward.  This code can be inserted
into an existing IEFUJI, or can be introduced as a new IEFUJI.
Details on IEFUJI can be obtained from the IBM SMF manual.

                      Chapter 3 - Execution
                       Execution Checklist

The following is an execution checklist that should be used when
executing DAF.

[    ]    Step 1  -  Determine which SMF data to use

[    ]    Step 2  -  Determine which control statements to use

[    ]    Step 3  -  Use DAF.EXE to generate control statements,
JCL and submit JOB

[    ]    Step 4  -  Review system output

[    ]    Step 5  -  Repeat steps 1 through 4 until the desired
information is received

                      Execution Procedures

Step 1  -  Determine which SMF data to use

DAF can access either SMF QSAM dump datasets or SMF VSAM
recording datasets.  Most installations have generation data
groups (GDGs) set up to catalog and maintain a specific amount of
cumulative, daily and weekly dumped SMF datasets.  You should
select SMF data according to the timeframe you want to audit.

Step 2  -  Determine which control statements to use

By default, DAF will report on all records.  To use DAF
effectively, you need to specify control statements to limit the
scope of the audit.  For example, to audit a group of production
jobs, the control statement JOB EQ A10* could be used to select
all the jobs that begin with the characters A10.  If this is
still to wide of a focus, additional control statements can be
added to further qualify the search, such as DD EQ SYSIN or
DATASET EQ PROD.PARMLIB.

Step 3  -  Use DAF.EXE to generate control statements, JCL and
submit JOB

The file DAF.EXE contains the following execution JCL.

  //ZT15$EXE JOB
(SZ0000),'DAF_EXE',CLASS=U,MSGCLASS=X,NOTIFY=ZT15
  //DAF        EXEC PGM=DAF,PARM=
  //STEPLIB    DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS2.DAF.V32.LINKLIB
  //DAFSMF     DD DISP=SHR,DSN=SYS2.SMF.BBC1.DAILY(+0)
  //DAFLOG     DD SYSOUT=*
  //DAFRPT     DD SYSOUT=*
  //DAFSTAT    DD SYSOUT=*
  //DAFSNAP    DD SYSOUT=*
  //DAFTRACE   DD SYSOUT=*
  //SYSPRINT   DD SYSOUT=*
  //SRTMSG     DD SYSOUT=*
  //SYSUDUMP   DD SYSOUT=*
  //SYSOUT     DD SYSOUT=*
  //SORTSNAP   DD SYSOUT=*
  //SORTIN     DD UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(CYL,(250,50))
  //SORTOUT DD UNIT=SYSDA,SPACE=(CYL,(250,50))
  //DAFCS   DD *
    (control statements go here)

Note:
STEPLIB should specify the library used in the installation
process.
DAFSMF should specify the SMF dumped data to be used for this
particular audit.
Control statements should be inserted after the DAFCS JCL
statement.
SORTIN/SORTOUT capacity is a direct function of the amount of SMF
data selected for reporting.
JCL EXEC PARM=CRITRACE should only be used at the request of the
vendor.
JCL EXEC PARM=INVTRACE is described in Appendix B:  Invalid SMF
Records.
JCL EXEC PARM=MODTRACE should only be used at the request of the
vendor.

                      Execution Procedures

Step 4  -  Review system output

To get a feel for the results of the audit, you should first look
at DAFSTAT.  DAFSTAT is a statistics page that shows you
processing statistics by SMF record type in the following
categories.

  DAFSMF  The number of SMF records read in
  DAFRPT  The number of records written to the report file
  Invalid   The number of SMF records that contain invalid
dataset names
          (See Appendix B:  Invalid SMF Records for details)

The section entitled DAFSMF Date/Time Range is helpful in
determining if the audit used the appropriate SMF dumped data.

The results of the audit are written to DAFRPT.  The following
list contains common SMF records of interest.

  14 - NONVSAM Input
  15 - NONVSAM Output
  16 - DFSORT Input/Output
  17 - NONVSAM Delete
  18 - NONVSAM Rename
  61 - VSAM Define (ICF Catalog)
  62 - VSAM Open (ICF or VSAM Catalog)
  63 - VSAM Define (VSAM Catalog)
  64 - VSAM Status (ICF or VSAM Catalog)
  65 - VSAM Delete (ICF Catalog)
  66 - VSAM Alter (ICF Catalog)
  67 - VSAM Delete (VSAM Catalog)
  68 - VSAM Rename (VSAM Catalog)
  69 - VSAM Data Space (VSAM Catalog)
  77 - Enqueue Activity
  80 - RACF Processing Record
  83 - RACF Processing Record

Note:
ICF catalog cluster delete/defines will create 65/61 records.
VSAM catalog cluster delete/defines will create 67/63 records.
ICF and VSAM catalog opens will create 62 records for the
cluster.
ICF and VSAM catalog closes will create 64 records for both the
data and index.
Implicit GDG rolloffs (creating limit+1) are transparent and do
not create any records.
Explicit GDG deletes will create 17 and 65 or 67 records.
Only the first dataset in a concatenation will contain a DDNAME
(Type 14 records).

Step 5  -  Repeat steps 1 through 4 until the desired information
is received

                       Control Statements

By default, DAF reports on all activity.  The art of using DAF
effectively is the ability to limit record selection.  This can
be accomplished implicitly by using only the SMF data you want to
audit and/or explicitly by specifying control statements to limit
the scope of the audit.

Control statements have a few simple rules:

1)   General syntax of control statements are keyword operator
value
2)   An asterisk in column one will be treated as a comment
3)   Only one keyword operator value may be specified on each
control statement
4)   The following value filters are available:
  ?  Single character wildcard
  *  Multiple character wildcard
5)   Keywords with a type of Dataset, Enqueue and RACF are
specific types and cannot be intermixed with each other. The
following keywords are available:

                Appendix B:  Invalid SMF Records

If numbers appear in the invalid column in the statistics
contained on DAFSTAT, it is an indication that the integrity of
the SMF records is suspect.  DAF does not validate all SMF
fields.  DAF only validates those that are documented to contain
an MVS dataset name.

Rerun the job with a JCL EXEC PARM=INVTRACE.  This parameter will
list general information on the invalid records on DAFTRACE and
also produce a comple hexadecimal dump of each invalid record on
DAFSNAP.  This information will help you determine the nature and
scope of the SMF integrity problem.

Known SMF corruption problems are listed below:

SMF60ENM invalid  -  OW03544,OW06470,OW10378
SMF60ENM/SMF60TYP invalid  -  OW14353
