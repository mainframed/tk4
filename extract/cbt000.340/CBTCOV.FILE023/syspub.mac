-             This User's  Guide defines SYSPUB Version  8.5 (78JAN08).
           It was produced using the SYSPUB commands,  with some of the
           SCRIPT  control  words  described in  the  "Introduction  to
           SCRIPT".   It  is assumed that you  will have access  to the
           "Introduction  to SCRIPT"  as  you  are reading  the  SYSPUB
           User's Guide.  The current version of SCRIPT is:

+                                    OVERVIEW
-             Many publications in an academic  environment have a num-
           ber of things in common:
0          * preliminary pages:   a title page or area, an abstract, an
             acknowledgements section or page,  a Table of Contents,  a
             List of Tables, and a List of Figures.
0          * a main body:    chapters and appendices divided  into sec-
             tions, subsections, and subsubsections, with tables,  fig-
             ures, block quotations,  footnotes,  lists of points,  and
             some additional components such as an index and a bibliog-
             raphy.
0          However,  different types of  documents have different "lay-
           out" requirements.  In some cases, the various levels of di-
           visions in the  main body must be numbered  (such as chapter
           "I", section "1.1", and subsection "1.1.1"); in others, such
           numbering is not required.  In some cases, new chapters must
           begin on new pages; in others, it isn't desired.
0             The physical layout of a document is just as important as
           the concepts and facts it attempts to convey.  Ensuring that
           the layout of a document follows a set of standards necessi-
           tates that an  identical sequence of layout  or "formatting"
           operations be performed  for each similar item  in the docu-
           ment.  This is time-consuming, repetitive, error-prone work.
           If the document  is being prepared  on a typewriter,   it is
           also work which must be re-done with each successive draft.
0             SYSPUB is a set of commands designed specifically for use
           in preparing and formatting papers, theses,  and other types
           of  research and  instructional publications  common to  the
           university environment.    For years,  people have  used the
           computer to perform some of this work;  SYSPUB offers a num-
           ber of additional advantages.
0             SYSPUB  provides 35  different commands  for the  various
           components of  your document.   There  are also  9 different
           output formats, called "layouts".   When you use SYSPUB, you
           begin by selecting the layout most appropriate to your docu-
           ment,  but the commands you use  thereafter are the same for
           all layouts.    The following is  a sample input  file which
           formats a document in the form of a paper:

                .prelim 'Abstract'
                .para
                text of abstract
                .chapter 'Title of First Chapter'
                .para
                text of first paragraph
                .para
                text of second paragraph
                .section 'Title of Section'
                .para
                text of paragraph
                .subsection 'Title of Subsection'
                .para
                  .
                  .
                  .
0             SYSPUB commands correspond to the component parts of your
           document.  For example, to start a new section, you specify
0               .section 'title of section'
0          and SYSPUB produces a section  heading which conforms to the
           layout style you are using.   The same is true for the other
           SYSPUB commands:    SYSPUB eliminates  the need  to learn  a
           widely-accepted set of layout standards.
0             SYSPUB eliminates the re-numbering problems caused by re-
           visions.   It does the numbering for all of the above items,
           as appropriate to the layout you are using.  If you delete a
           section,  or add a chapter,  or  change the order of subsec-
           tions,  they are automatically re-numbered the next time you
           format your document.   The creative desire to add or delete
           information no longer causes additional "re-work".
0             With the simpler  layouts,  you don't need to  use all of
           the SYSPUB commands.   For example,   most small reports and
           papers do not  have an index or a table  of contents.   How-
           ever, with larger documents, such as users' guides and manu-
           als, these are usually desired.
0             SYSPUB also has a number of specific-purpose layouts, in-
           cluding layouts for  theses which adhere to  the style indi-
           cated in the University's Thesis Regulations and Guide broc-
+                                    ______ ___________ ___ _____

           publications.
0             When you use SYSPUB,  you are actually using a "superset"
           of the  University of  Waterloo version  of the  SCRIPT text
           formatter, and all of the capabilities of SCRIPT are availa-

           ble to you.   SYSPUB doesn't  do anything which you couldn't
           do yourself  using SCRIPT;  it  just eliminates the  need to
           learn everything about SCRIPT, and simplifies a lot of tedi-
           ous work.    The number of  SCRIPT commands which  you might
           need in  addition to the SYSPUB  commands is very  small (in
           most cases,  the  SCRIPT commands which leave  a blank line,
           centre a line, and underscore a word will be sufficient).

0             The SYSPUB commands are stored in a special library which
           you must imbed at the beginning of your SCRIPT input file by
           placing the SCRIPT "imbed" control word
0               .im syspub layout=xxx
0          before the first  occurrence of any SYSPUB  command (usually
           as the very first line in your file.   In place of the char-
           acters "xxx",  you must specify one  of the layouts shown in
           Table 1.

0             SYSPUB assumes that the formatted document is to be prod-
           uced on 8.5x11 pages with a  1.5-inch margin on the left and
           1-inch margins on the top, bottom, and right.  If the output
           device is  a high-speed  line printer,   no special  printer
           setup is necessary (aside from white paper and an upper- and
           lower-case print train).    If the output device  is a type-
           writer terminal, the left margin of the typewriter should be
           set one-half inch in from the left side of the paper.

0             SYSPUB assumes  that the  output is  being produced  on a
           10-pitch device (10 characters to the horizontal inch).   If
           you are using a 12-pitch output device, specify "pitch=12".
0             If the final copy of your publication is to be reproduced
           on both sides of the page,  the "sides" parameter will allow
           you to specify this.
0             The "hy" parameter controls hyphenation:  "on" results in
           automatic hyphenation,  "full" is the  same as "on" but also

           will hyphenate  only at hyphen  points defined in  the input
           text (such as in compound words),  and "off" causes hyphena-
           tion not to be performed at all.
0             The "ju",  "pl",  and "ll" parameters have the same func-
           tion as their SCRIPT control-word equivalents.
0             By default,  SYSPUB always numbers pages at the bottom of
           the pages;  the "pagenum" parameter provides a way of having
           SYSPUB number the pages at  the top,  except for preliminary
           pages and the first page of  each major division of the main
           body.
0             For those layouts which cause  the various headings to be
           numbered,  you can  control the level to  which headings are
           numbered by specifying the "headnum" parameter.  By default,
           all levels  of headings from  the first level  (chapters and
           appendicies)  down to the fourth level (subsubsections)  are
           numbered by those layouts.   For example,  specifying "head-
           num=1" will  cause chapters and  appendices to  be numbered,
           but not sections, subsections, or subsubsections.

0             SYSPUB can  be very  useful while  you are  still at  the
           stage of planning the general  organization of your publica-
           tion.  You can enter the SYSPUB commands to create the major
           divisions of the publication, and then format and print this
           first-draft "outline" document.   Completing the publication
           then becomes a process of "filling in the blanks".

0             If you are using SCRIPT under CMS, you will probably have
           to "define storage"  to at least "400K".   If  you are using
           the BATCH Service, you will have to change your EXEC card to
0               //  EXEC  SCRIPT,SIZE=200K
0          Depending on  the size of  your publication,  you  might not
           need all 200K,  but it is safer  to start high and work down
           (the printout will tell you how much was actually used).
0             If you are specifying the "hy=full" parameter, you should
           add 44K to the above figures.

+                _____ ___ ______ ______ _____
0             If you  are using SYSPUB for  the first time,   you might
           find it most  productive to adopt a  step-by-step "workbook"
           approach to using this User's Guide.  First, select the lay-
           out which you  suspect is most appropriate  for the publica-
           tion you are going to prepare, and read up to the end of the
           chapter which describes that layout.   Skim over the rest of
           the User's Guide so that you are aware of the additional ca-
           pabilities of SYSPUB.   While you are constructing your pub-
           lication,  treat the entire User's Guide as a reference man-
           ual.

0             The ".para" command may be used to start a paragraph.  It
           is used as shown below:
0               .para
                text of paragraph
                .para
                text of next paragraph
0             By default, the ".para" command indents each paragraph by
           putting 3 blanks at the start of the first line of text fol-
           lowing the ".para" command.  This can be changed by specify-
           ing an  "alternate paragraph indent"  as the operand  of the
           ".para" command.  For example, if
0               .para 5
0          is specified, then the ".para" command will indent all para-
           graphs 5 spaces, from this point on and until the "paragraph
           indent" is re-set by another ".para" command with an "alter-
           nate paragraph indent" specified.

0             If any punctuation is to come  between the "word" and the
           footnote  number,  it  should be  specified as  part of  the
           first-operand "word" to be  referenced.   If any punctuation

           2.7.5   Altering the Numbering Style for Lists of Points
+          2.7.5   Altering the Numbering Style for Lists of Points
+                  ________ ___ _________ _____ ___ _____ __ ______
0             By default,  SYSPUB numbers first-level points using ara-
           bic numerals, second-level points using lower-case alphabet-
           ics, and third-level points using lower-case roman numerals.
           You can change this style by  using the "set" operand of the
           SYSPUB ".point" command.  For example,
0               .point set 1 a i
0          will set the point-numbering style  to the defaults just de-
           scribed.
0               .point set i a 1
0          will cause first-level  points to  be numbered  using lower-
           case roman numerals ("i"), second-level points to use lower-
           case alphabetics ("a"), and third-level points to use arabic
           numerals ("1").
0             Operands other than "1", "a",  and "i" are valid.   A "b"
           operand causes SYSPUB to generate  bullets for all points at
           the level for which it is specified.   (If the output is be-
           ing produced at an on-line terminal, asterisks are generated
           instead of bullets.)   If a character other than one of "1",
           "a", "i",  or "b" is specified,  then that character will be
           used in a fashion similar to that for "bullets".

           2.7.6   Limitations
+          2.7.6   Limitations
+                  ___________
0             There are  a few things  to keep  in mind when  using the
           above point-generating SYSPUB commands.
0             1.  The "point" commands automatically indent the left
                  and right margins,  so that the text of the points
                  are "set in" from the  main text.   Therefore,  if
                  you wish  to use the  SCRIPT ".in"  INDENT control
                  word in a point,  use the additive rather than the
                  absolute form of the arguments.
0             2.  It is possible to use  ".point end" to return from
                  "point mode" temporarily (for example,  to explain
                  something about the preceding or following points)
                  and then  resume the  "point mode"  without inter-
                  rupting  the numbering  sequence  of  the list  of
                  points.   In  this case,  after  the text  for the
                  "normal  mode" has  been specified,   the list  of
                  points can be  continued by using the  SYSPUB com-
                  mand ".point" instead of ".point begin".
0          For example, the text of the above point was terminated with
-                                     - 14 -
1
-
           ".point end",   and the text of  the next point  was started
           with ".point" rather than with ".point begin".
0             3.  If you  want to  alter the  formatting environment
                  for all  the points generated between  the ".point
                  begin" and  ".point end" commands,  do  it immedi-
                  ately before the ".point begin" command.   For ex-
                  ample, if the  normal formatting mode  is "double-
                  spaced and right-justified", but you want the text
                  of the points  to be single-spaced and  not right-
                  justified, you can specify
0                      ,ss;.ju no;.point begin
0                 and  then the  text  for  the first  point.    The
                  ".point end" command will restore the default for-
                  matting parameters.   (The  ",ss" above is  a "no-
                  break single space" control word; the comma is es-
                  tablished as  the no-break  contro word  indicator
                  when you imbed  SYSPUB -- see Appendix  A for more
                  details).

0             2.  You may use the SCRIPT  ".bx" control word to cre-
                  ate  "horizontal   lines"  within  the   range  of
                  ".boxon" and ".boxoff".
0             3.  If you wish to use the SCRIPT ".in" indent control
                  word within  the range of ".boxon"  and ".boxoff",
                  then  use the  additive rather  than the  absolute
                  form of the arguments;  for example,  use ".in +5"
                  rather than ".in 5".  This is necessary because of
                  the SCRIPT ".in" control  words issued by ".boxon"
                  and ".boxoff":
0                      .boxon  issues  ..in +3 -3
                       .boxoff issues  ..in -3 +3
0             4.  The SYSPUB  ".boxon" and  ".boxoff" commands,   by
                  themselves,  make no attempt to  keep the box from
                  being split over a page  boundary.   If you do not
                  want it split across a page boundary, then use the
                  SCRIPT ".cc"  or ".fk" or  ".fb" control  words to
                  ensure that  the box is  contiguous.   If  you use
                  ".fb" or ".fk",  or ".cc"  in its "begin/end" form
                  to do this,   do not rely on the values  of any of
                  the  SCRIPT  system reference  variables  such  as
                  "&syspage"  or  "&sysline"  within  the  range  of
                  ".boxon" and ".boxoff",  as  there is no guarantee
                  that the box  will print in the  position in which
                  it was formatted;  use ".cc"  with a numeric argu-
                  ment instead.

           2.9   TABLES
+          2.9   TABLES
+                ______
0             Turabian [1973:159] makes an excellent statement concern-
           ing the attention  you must give to tables if  you are going
           to use them effectively:
0               If tables are to  serve satisfactorily the purpose
                for which they are made, they not only must be ac-
                curately  compiled but  must be  so arranged  that
                they can be easily read and interpreted.  To these
                ends careful spacing, ruling, arrangement of head-
                ings, and, finally, the placing of the tables with
                respect to the text all contribute.
0             The following SYSPUB  commands are used to  construct ta-
           bles.   The SYSPUB command ".tabnum" is used to generate the
           table number.    The SYSPUB command  ".tabbegin" is  used to

-
           start the  definition of the  text and SCRIPT  control words
           which create the table.  The SYSPUB command ".table" is used
           to print the table number and title;  and the SYSPUB command
           ".tabend" is used to end the  definition of the table and to
           cause it to be positioned for  printing.   If the table will
           fit in the position at which you have defined it, it will do
           so.  Otherwise, SCRIPT will promote it to another page (usu-
           ally,  the  next page).   To give  you a better idea  of how
           these commands are used, consider the following example; the
           commands themselves  are described in more  detail following
           the example.

0             Assume that we now wish to  make our first reference to a
           particular table.    To begin,  we  will generate  "the next
           available table number" and assign it to the reference vari-
           able "example".

0          Then,  we can  use the reference variable  "example" to make
           the reference to the table.

           the first reference to it in the text.  Since tables must be
           numbered in ascending order throughout the publication,  the
           SYSPUB command
0               .tabnum refname
0          enables you  to generate "the  next available number"  for a
           table and assign that number to the reference variable "ref-
           name",  and then use "refname" to  refer to the table in the
           text, before the table is defined, constructed, and printed.

+          2.9.3   Positioning the Table
+                  ___________ ___ _____
0             It is desirable to print the table itself as soon as pos-
           sible  after  it has  first  been  referenced in  the  text.
           Therefore,  at the  end of the paragraph  which contains the
           first reference to the table, the SYSPUB commands and SCRIPT
           control words  required to  define the  table should  be in-
           serted, starting with the SYSPUB command
0               .tabbegin
0          The ".tabbegin" command  causes single-spacing to be  in ef-
           fect  and  places  you in  unformatted  mode.    The  SYSPUB
           ".tabend" command  described below  restores the  formatting
           mode and the "line-spacing" to whatever was in effect before
           ".tabbegin" was encountered.

0             The ".tabbegin" command should be  followed by the SYSPUB
           command
0               .table refname 'title of table'
0          which prints the word "Table",   the value of "refname" (the
           table number),  the  title of the table,  and  leaves you in
           ".fo no" mode.   It should then  be followed by the text and
           SCRIPT control  words needed to  construct the table  (or to
           leave space in which to paste in  the table,  if that is how
           it is to be done).

+          2.9.5   Terminating the Table
+                  ___________ ___ _____
0             To terminate the table, the SYSPUB command
0               .tabend
0          must be inserted next.  It causes the table to be positioned
           and printed,   and restores  the formatting  environment for
           normal text.   Every attempt will be  made to keep the table
           contiguous on one page (unless  the table requires more than
           one page).
0             If you specify this command in the form
0               .tabend page
0          then SYSPUB will  add the number of blank  lines required to
           result in a full-page table.

0             You cannot define a footnote within the range of a table.
           Also, don't use the SCRIPT ".ix" index control word within a
           table;  it will most likely result  in the wrong page number
           in the index, since the table will probably print some other
           than where where it was formatted.

0             The considerations which must be given to tables also ap-
           ply to figures.   The SYSPUB  commands for figures are exact
           parallels of those defined above for tables, with the excep-
           tion that  the ".figbegin"  command leaves  you in  ".fo no"
           mode.  For example,

           after the ".tabbegin" command, and the ".boxoff" command was
           placed immediately before the ".tabend" command.

0             Each of  the bibliographic  entries is  started with  the
           SYSPUB command
0               .bib
0          If you do not have a style to which you must adhere, then it
           is suggested that the following general  form be used to en-
           ter the text for the bibliographic entry.
0               .bib
                last name of author, first name, initials.
                .us title of reference.
                place of publication:  publisher, year.
0             You do not  need to specify any SCRIPT  control words for
           the formatting of the bibliographic entries; the ".bib" com-
           mand does that  for you (see the Bibliography at  the end of
           this User's Guide for an example of the formatting).

              In order  to keep the text  for a bibliographic  entry on
           one page,  SYSPUB internally places a SCRIPT ".cc" begin/end
           sequence around the text of  the bibliographic entry.   This
           means that you cannot use ".cc",  ".cp",  ".fk",  ".fn",  or
           ".fb" in conjunction with the SYSPUB commands for the bibli-
           ography.

+                                THE GUIDE LAYOUT
-             With layouts lesser than GUIDE, SYSPUB does not produce a
           Table of Contents,  and hence  is somewhat less expensive to
           use.   With the GUIDE layout  (or greater),  SYSPUB includes
           the titles of preliminary pages, chapters, appendices,  sec-
           tions, subsections,  and subsubsections in the Table of Con-
           tents,  together with  the titles specified by  the commands
           introduced in this  chapter.   It also constructs  a List of
           Tables and a List of Figures,  using the titles specified by
           the SYSPUB commands which create tables and figures.
0             The GUIDE layout  is intended for papers  which are large
           enough to warrant  a Table of Contents and/or  an Index,  or
           for other medium-sized documents which do not warrant start-
           ing each chapter  on a new page.   It is  assumed that there
           will be at  least one section created by  the ".prelim" com-
           mand (subsequent occurrences do not  start new pages),  fol-
           lowed by  one or more  sections created by  ".chapter" (only
           the first  chapter will begin on  a new page),   followed by
           zero or more sections created  by ".appendix" (each appendix
           starts on a new page),   possibly followed by the additional
+                                   ________
           commands introduced in Table 6.

0               .index

0             If it is  appropriate that your publication  contain more
           than one index (the SCRIPT ".ix"  control word allows you to
           construct up to nine concurrently),   then each index can be
           printed by specifying the SYSPUB command
0               .index n 'title'
0          once for each index,  where "n"  is the index number (from 1
           to 9)  and "title" is the title  to be centred at the top of
           the first page of index "n".
0             Note that this  form of the ".index" command  may also be
           used to specify  an alternate title for  a publication which
           contains only one index, by specifying

0             By default,  the  index will be printed  in single-column
           mode, the same as the rest of the publication.   If your in-
           dex entries are short,  you may wish to have them printed in
           more than one column per page.  For example,

           will cause the index to be printed in two columns.   You can
           specify a number larger than "2" for this third operand, but
           you may run into problems unless you have used the "ll" par-
           ameter to  specify a  line length  greater than  the default
           when you imbedded SYSPUB.

0             The "contents" command  causes the printing of  the Table

0               .contents 'alternate header'
0          where "alternate header" is any character string you wish to
           use as the title  of the Table of Contents.   If  you do not
           specify an  "alternate header",  then  the header  "TABLE OF
           CONTENTS" will be used.
0             Unless you have  tables or figures,  ".contents"  will be
           the last SYSPUB command in  your input file.   The resulting
           Table of Contents pages will be numbered in lower-case roman
           numerals,  starting  one greater than the  last "preliminary
           page" before the main body.   You  will have to remove these
           Table of Contents  pages from the end of the  output and in-
           sert them in their proper place.

-             The MANUAL  layout is  intended for  documents which  are
           large enough to warrant a formal  title page and a number of
           preliminary pages.   If the document is large enough,  chap-
           ters may be grouped together in "parts".  Preliminary pages,
           parts,  chapters,  and appendices each  start on a new page.
           The additional SYSPUB commands are shown in Table 7.

+                  _______ ___  ________  __ ____ _____ ____
0             In some publications,  the term  "chapter" may not be ap-
           propriate,  and therefore you may  want some word other than
           "Chapter" to be used as a  "header" at the beginning of each
           "chapter".  For example, if you specify
0               .major 'Section'
0          immediately before the first occurence of ".chapter", SYSPUB
           will print the  word "Section" at the top of  the first page
           of  each  "chapter".   Note  that  you  must still  use  the
           ".chapter" command  to create  the major  divisions of  your
           publication,   even though  you are  calling them  something
           else.

           Chapter numbers will normally be  printed as upper-case ro-
            man numerals.   However,   if the ".part" command  has been
            used before  the first  ".chapter" command  is encountered,
            then  chapter numbers  are printed  as  arabic numerals  to
            avoid confusion.

           The "copyright symbol" is optional;   if the command is used
           as ".date" only,  then the characters  "(c)" will be used as
           the copyright symbol.
0             If the  "date" and  "copyright" lines  which the  ".date"
           command produces  are not appropriate for  your publication,
           you can omit the ".date" command, and instead use the appro-
           priate SCRIPT control words and text lines.

           produced on the  grid sheets provided by  the IEEE Editorial
           Department for the preparation of  papers in two-column for-
           mat for IEEE photo-offset publications.   It provides all of
           the SYSPUB  commands which correspond  to the  PAPER layout,
           with the differences and/or exceptions noted below:
0             1.  none  of  the  headings  produced  by  ".chapter",
                  ".section", or ".subsection" will be numbered;
0             2.  titles produced by ".chapter" will be centred, un-
                  derscored, and capitalized;
0             3.  titles produced by ".section" will underscored and
                  printed flush with the left margin, exactly as en-
                  tered;
0             4.  titles  printed by  ".subsection"  will be  under-
                  scored and indented as the  starting text in a new
                  paragraph.
0          A sample input file using the IEEE layout is shown in Figure
           7.
0             If the  paper is being produced  at 8 lines to  the inch,
           then specify the parameter "lpi=8"  on the ".im syspub" com-
           mand.

0             SYSPUB, by default, removes from you all control over the
           number of title lines in the top and bottom margins, because
           it constantly issues its own  SCRIPT ".hs" and ".fs" control
           words as it is deciding when to print the top and bottom ti-
           tle lines.  You can re-define the top and bottom title after
           you imbed SYSPUB,  but SYSPUB will  decide when to print the
           top title and when to print  the bottom title.   If you wish
           to define any number of top and bottom title lines which are
           always to be printed at the top and bottom of each and every

0          should be specified before the  first occurrence of the SYS-

0             If  you wish  to omit  the  subsection and  subsubsection
           headings from the Table of Contents for a particular chapter
           (or range of chapters), then specify the SCRIPT control word
0               .sr pubSWinc = 2
0          before the occurrence of the SYSPUB ".chapter" command which
           defines the first  chapter for which you  want them omitted,
           and then specify the SCRIPT control word
0               .sr pubSWinc = 4
0          at the very  end of the chapter  (or at the very  end of the
           last chapter in  the range of chapters)  for  which you want
           them to be omitted from the Table of Contents.

0             For your  convenience,  SYSPUB defines a  translate table
           which will map the digits 0 through 9 into their superscript
           equivalents.   All you need to do  to take advantage of this
           is to  use the "set"  operand of  ".ti" to define  an escape
           character.  For example, if you specify
0               .ti set #
0          as the "translate on input" escape character,  then an input
           line containing the characters

+                ________ ___ _____________ _______
0             The bibliography, if present in a publication,  is placed
           at the  end of the publication  (unless there is  an index).
           However, to allow you to reference the bibliographic entries
           with symbolic  references instead of absolute  numbers,  the
           SYSPUB commands  to format the  bibliography can  be entered
           immediately after the SYSPUB commands for the title page and
           immediately before  the SYSPUB  command for  the preliminary
           pages (or parts  and chapters,  if there  are no preliminary
           pages).   If you do this, you must use the ".bib" command in
           the form
0               .bib refname
0          where "refname" is a unique  one- to eight-character "refer-
           ence name" which the  author assigns.   Bibliographic refer-
           ence numbers will be generated  automatically and printed to
           the left of each reference.

0             In the main body of  the publication,  the "refname"  may
           be used  to refer to  the bibliographic entry  by specifying
           the "refname" followed by a period  followed by a colon fol-
           lowed by the  appropriate page number(s)  in  the reference.
           For example,  if  "turabian" were the "refname"  assigned to
           the publication by  Turabian (see the Bibliography  for this
           SYSPUB User's  Guide),  then it  could be referenced  in the
           form

           to reference  the pages in  that publication  which describe
           this method.  The number assigned to the bibliographic entry
           by the ".bib" command is substituted automatically for "ref-
           name" (in this case,   "turabian").   Therefore,  if biblio-
           graphic entries are added to  or deleted from the bibliogra-
           phy during the writing of the publication,  there is no need
           to have to  worry about using the  proper "reference number"
           in the main body of the paper.
