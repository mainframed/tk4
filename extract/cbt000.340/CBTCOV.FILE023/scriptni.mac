                                     ABSTRACT
-             The University of Waterloo version of SCRIPT (referred to
           as Waterloo SCRIPT, or simply as SCRIPT)  is a powerful text
           formatting program.    A general  introduction to  SCRIPT is
           given  in the  "Introduction to  SCRIPT" document  available
           from any of the Consulting Offices.   It is assumed that you
           are familiar with  and experienced at using  the SCRIPT con-
           trol words presented in that document.
0             This "SCRIPT Techniques" document illustrates some of the
           programming-language capabilities of SCRIPT  which will ena-
           ble you to automate the preparation and maintenance of docu-
           mentation.
0             There are two good reasons  for automating the production
           of documentation:
0             1.  to eliminate  the "unnecessary re-work"  impact of
                  making changes, so that you can add a chapter, de-
                  lete  a section,   interchange  large sections  of
                  text, etc., without affecting the rest of the doc-
                  ument;
0             2.  to make it easier for someone else to learn how to
                  use the computer to prepare documenation, and also
                  reduce the amount of "human  time" needed to prod-
                  uce a document.
0             A number  of the  techniques presented  in the  following
           pages can be used to create  a set of "higher-level" format-
           ting commands  so that  repetitive tasks  can be  automated,
           standardized, and simplified.

                         1.  IMBEDDING OTHER INPUT FILES
0             With any large document,  it is to your advantage to cre-
           ate a separate  input file (collection of  input lines)  for
+                                ____
           each of its  constituent parts,  and then  construct a small
           "driver" file to imbed each file, in the desired order.   In
           this fashion,  small sections of text may be developed inde-
           pendently and may easily be interchanged by changing the or-
           der in which they are imbedded.
0             You can  instruct SCRIPT to  imbed another input  file by
           using the ".im" IMBED control word.   For example, if an in-
           put file consisted only of
0               .im chap1;.im chap2;.im chap3
0          the three "chapters"  could be maintained as  three separate
           files.  Moreover, the first file, "chap1", could consist of
0               .im sect1;.im sect2
0          which would,  in turn,  cause two  more files to be imbedded
           during the formatting process.

0          2.1   SYSTEM REFERENCE VARIABLES
+                ______ _________ _________
0             SCRIPT maintains  a large  number of  "status indicators"
           and "system information  values" in special variables called
           "System Reference Variables".  In the examples listed below,
           the name  of the System Reference  Variable is shown  on the
           right,  followed by  a brief explanation,  followed  in par-
           entheses by it's value at the time this document was format-
           ted.
0          SYSDATE    contains today's date (October 8, 1985)
0          SYSLINE    the current line number on the page (49)
0          SYSLL      the current LINE LENGTH (60)
0          SYSPAGE    contains the current page number, as a number (1)
0          SYSPPAGE   contains the current page number, as a character
                      string (1)
                      (if we were on page 2 and page numbers were being
                      printed as lower-case roman numerals, SYSPPAGE
                      would have the value "ii")

           SYSOUT     a "TERM" if output is on-line, otherwise "PRINT"
                      (PRINT)
0             System Reference Variables are used in conjunction with
           the ".ur" control word, as shown in the following example
           which prints today's date.
0               .ur Today is &sysdate..
0             The first period after "&sysdate" is treated as a "conca-
           tenation indicator" by SCRIPT.  Thus, "&sysdate.." means
           "today's date, concatenated with a period", and the result
           is:
0               Today is October 8, 1985.

           2.2   USER-DEFINED REFERENCE VARIABLES
+                ____________ _________ _________
0             You  can define  Reference Variables  of  your own  (just
           don't pick names which start with the letters "sys") and as-
           sign values to them by using the ".sr" control word.
0               .sr name = numeric integer value
                .sr name = string
                .sr name = 'a delimited string'
0          The name of  a Reference Variable may contain up  to ten al-
           phanumeric characters.   A Reference Variable may optionally
           be subscripted from  (-32767)  to (+32767).   The  value as-
           signed to the Reference Variable may  be an integer (such as
           3), an undelimited string (such as the word dog),  or a del-
+          _                                           ___
           imited string (such as 'hello_there').
+                                 ______ ______
0             If you wish to use other Reference Variables on the left-
           or right-hand side of the "=",  then you must use the alter-
           nate form of SET REFERENCE, ".se",  which does symbolic sub-
           stitution as many times as  is needed to eliminate Reference
           Variables from both the "name" and "value" fields.   For ex-
           ample,
0               .se i = &i + 1
0          adds 1 to the previous value of Reference Variable "i".   If
           "i" has not previously been defined, the above is equivalent
           to
0               .se i =  + 1
0          since the "&i" results in the null string.

              If Reference  Variable "dog" contained the  string "cat",
           then
0               .se &dog = 1
0          would create a Reference Variable "cat" with the value "1".

           2.3   AUTOMATIC SUBSTITUTION OF REFERENCE VARIABLES
+                _________ ____________ __ _________ _________
0             Whenever there  are a  large number  of lines  containing
           Reference Variables,  it is often  easier to use the SUBSTI-
           TUTE REFERENCE control word ".su"  to cause symbolic substi-
           tution, rather than numerous occurrences of ".ur".   For ex-
           ample, the following
0               .su on
                .sr fignum = &fignum + 1
                Figure &fignum ....... &sysppage
                .su off
0          produces:
0               Figure 2 ....... 3

           2.4   THE "PERFORM" CONTROL WORD
+                ___  _______  _______ ____
0             The SCRIPT ".pe"  control word is used in one  of the two
           forms
0               .pe n;operand line          .pe n
                                    (or)    operand line
0          It causes the "operand line",  which may contain both SCRIPT
           control words and text,  to be "performed" the specified "n"
           times.   For example, it is sometimes desirable to construct
           a dashed  line which will stretch  across the full  width of
           the page (that is,  has the same  number of "-"s as the LINE
           LENGTH value).  This can be done as follows:
0               .sr dash = ''
                .ur .pe &sysll
                .se dash = '-&dash'
0          The first line sets "dash" to  the null string.   The second
           line  results in  a  "perform counter"  equal  to the  ".ll"
           value.   The  third line  adds another "-"  to the  value of
           "dash".   The Reference Variable "dash"  can then be used to
           create a dashed line across the page, as follows:
0               .br;.ur &dash
0                                     - 3 -

           2.5   TESTING VARIOUS CONDITIONS:  THE "IF" CONTROL WORD
+                _______ _______ __________   ___  __  _______ ____
0             The full power of Reference Variables is realized in con-
           junction with the  ability to test the value  of a Reference
           Variable, and then conditionally do something.  For example,
           the input line
0               .ur .if &syspage ne 1;.pa
0          says "if the  value of the current page number  is not equal
           to 1,  then eject to the top  of the next page".   The ".if"
           control word has two forms:
0               .if <condition>;<operand>
0          and
0               .if <condition>
                .th <operand1>
                .el <operand2>
0          In both of  the above forms,  the "operand" may  be either a
           single SCRIPT control word, or it may be a text line.

           2.5.1   "DO" Groups
+                   __  ______
0             The full power of the ".if" control word is realized when
           it is used in conjunction with  the ".do" and ".do end" con-
           trol words.
0               .if <condition>;.th .do
                <operand1>
                .do end;.el .do
                <operand2>
                .do end
0          The operands can  now be any number of  SCRIPT control words
           and/or text lines.

           Reference  Variable  contains  an  integer  or  a  character
           string,  and to take a substring of the contents of a Refer-
           ence Variable, as shown below:
0          L'&refvar       the value of this expression is the number
                           of characters in the variable "refvar"
0          T'&refvar       the value of this expression is the charac-
                           ter "N" if "refvar" has an integer value, or
                           "C" otherwise
0          &refvar(m:n)    the value of this expression is a string
                           consisting of all the characters from posi-
                           tions "m" through "n" inclusive in the value
                           of "refvar"
0             For example,  let us assume that at the start of each ma-
           jor section  of a reference  manual,  the section  number is
           contained in the Reference Variable "number" and the section
           title in the  Reference Variable "title".   At  the start of
           each section, we wish to eject to a new page, reset the page
           number to  "1",  set the page  number prefix to the  first 5
           characters of the section title (in upper case) and followed
           by a dash, add one to the section number, and print the sec-
           tion number and title such that the title is underscored but
           the number is not.  If the title takes more than one line to
           print,  we want  the second and subsequent  lines offset ten
           spaces more than the length of the section number.  The fol-
           lowing sequence of SCRIPT control words accomplishes that:
0               .pa 1
                .ur .up .pn prefix &title(1:5).-
                .se number = &number + 1
                .ur .of 10+L'&number
                .ud set ×
                .ur .us ×&number   ×&title
                .of;.sp

0          3.1   MACROS
+                ______
0             A MACRO is a "named" sequence of SCRIPT control words and
           text delimited with ".dm" control words.  SCRIPT saves these
           input lines and invokes them automatically whenever the name
           of the MACRO is used as  a SCRIPT control word.   MACROs are
           of the form:
-
0                                     - 5 -
1
-
                .dm name begin
                text and/or additional SCRIPT control words
                .dm name end
0          and are invoked by specifying:
0               .name operands
0          The operands can be a mixture of two forms:   positional and
           keyword.   When the MACRO is  invoked,  SCRIPT processes the
           keyword operands as though they were of the form
0               .sr keyword=value
0          and assigns  the values  of the  positional operands  to the
           Reference Variables "1", "2", "3", ..., and assigns the num-
+                                                                  ___
           ber of  positional operands to  the Reference  Variable "0",
+          ___
           and then executes the body of the MACRO.
0             For example,  in Section 2.6 on page 5,  we illustrated a
           sequence of SCRIPT  control words which were  to be executed
           at the start of each section of a reference manual.   By us-
           ing MACROs,  we  could write a higher-level  formatting com-
           mand, called "section", to do the same thing:
0               .dm section begin
                .pa 1
                .ur .up .pn prefix &1(1:5).-
                .se number = &number + 1
                .ur .of 10+L'&number
                .ud set ×
                .ur .us ×&number   ×&1
                .of;.sp
                .dm section end
0          Now,  all that is necessary to start a new section is to use
           this "section" MACRO just like a SCRIPT control word:
0               .section 'title of section'
0          SCRIPT will assign the positional operand "title of section"
           to Reference Variable "1",  and execute  the body of the MA-
           CRO.
0             To give a simpler example, we can write a "paragraph" MA-
           CRO and use it to start each  paragraph of text in our docu-
           ment:
0               .dm para begin
                .sp a;.il +8
                .dm para end

           defines a MACRO named "para" which you can invoke by specif-
           ying
0               .para
0          and,  as a result,  one blank line will be generated and the
           next line of text will be  indented 8 positions to the right
           of the current INDENT value.

           3.2   REMOTES
+                _______
0             A REMOTE  is a special  sequence of SCRIPT  control words
           and/or text delimited by ".rm" control words.   SCRIPT saves
           these input lines and invokes them automatically when a par-
           ticular event occurs.  For example,
0               .rm 10
                text and/or other SCRIPT control words
                .rm
0          defines a REMOTE which will be  invoked the next time SCRIPT
           attempts to output something on line number 10 (if we're al-
           ready past line 10 on the current page,  then it will be in-
           voked at line 10 of the next  page).   If we wanted this se-
           quence invoked for  the next 5 occurrences of  line 10 (that
           is, on the next 5 pages), then changing the first line to
0               .rm 10 5
0          would accomplish that.   If we  wanted this sequence invoked
           on all subsequent pages, then
0               .rm 10 save
0          would prevent the REMOTE from  being deleted after being in-
           voked a specific number of times.
0             If we wanted to invoke this REMOTE ourselves,  whether we
           were on line 10 or not,  we  could do so by using the SCRIPT
           ".si" (SIGNAL REMOTE) control word:
0               .si 10
0             If we wanted to delete the REMOTE, to prevent it from be-
           ing invoked again, we could do so by specifying:
0               .rm 10 delete
0             Rather than  deleting a REMOTE,   it may be  desirable to
           "deactivate" it temporarily.  This can be done as follows:
-
                                      - 7 -
1
-
                .rm 10 save
                .ur &efcm
                text and/or control words
                .rm
0          Setting the Reference Variable "efcm" to the value ".cm" re-
           sults in  a "comment" line when  the REMOTE is  invoked,  so
           that the  "text and/or control  words" which follow  it will
           get executed as  normal.   When we want  to "deactivate" the
           REMOTE,  however,  re-defining the Reference Variable "efcm"
           to have the value ".ef" (END FILE) will cause SCRIPT to ter-
           minate processing of  the REMOTE when it  executes the ".ef"
           control word.   The REMOTE will  still be invoked every time
           SCRIPT tries to print on line 10,  but it won't do anything.
           You can re-define "efcm" back to ".cm"  when you want to re-
           activate the REMOTE later.

-                              4.  FLOATING BLOCKS
0             SCRIPT provides several control words which cause text to
           be formatted into  an "internal workarea" and  then printed;
           they are of the form
0               .xx begin
                text and/or additional control words
                .xx end n
0          where ".xx" is one of the control words
0               .cc   (conditional column)
                .cp   (conditional page)
                .fk   (floating keep)
                .fb   (floating block)
0          SCRIPT formats the  text in this begin/end  sequence into an
           internal workarea,  and keeps a count of the number of lines
           of "output"  which resulted.    If an  integer "n"  has been
           specified after the "end" operand,  SCRIPT adds the value of
           "n" to  this count.   SCRIPT  uses the count  in determining
           where the block of "output" lines should be printed, as fol-
           lows:
0          .cc   if the number of lines remaining in the text area in
                 this column is less than the count of lines in the
                 block, SCRIPT begins a new column and then prints the
                 block

           .cp   if the number of lines remaining in the text area on
                 this page is less than the count of lines in the
                 block, SCRIPT begins a new page and then prints the
                 block
0          .fk   if the number of lines remaining in the text area in
                 this column is less than the count of lines in the
                 block, SCRIPT attempts to fill the remainder of this
                 column by formatting the input which follows the block
                 until the column is full, and then prints the block at
                 the top of the next column
0             The ".fb" (FLOATING  BLOCK)  control word functions  in a
           slightly different manner; the block doesn't print until you
           tell SCRIPT to print it,  and this makes ".fb" a useful pro-
           gramming tool.  SCRIPT provides two Reference Variables rel-
           ated to ".fb"s:
0          SYSFBC  the count of the total number of output lines wait-
                   ing to print, in all ".fb" blocks
0          SYSFBF  the count of the number of output lines in the FIRST
                   block waiting to print
0             To print a ".fb" block,  you must specify the SCRIPT con-
           trol word
0               .fb dump n
0          If used without specifying an "n", all existing ".fb" blocks
           will be printed;   if you just want to print  the first one,
           specify a value  of "1" for "n";   if you want to  print the
           first 3, then specify a value of "3".

            N.Y. 10017

              The layout grid provided by IEEEœ is a 9.5"x13" area with
           two columns with a 1/4" gutter  between them.   On the first
           page, the top  2.5" of the page  is to contain  a full-page-
           width title area,  and the bottom 2.5" of the left column is
           to be left blank for use by  the IEEE.   There is a two-line
           bottom margin;  page  numbers are centered on  the second of
           these two lines.   The style requirements dictate three lev-
           els of  headings,  which  we shall  refer to  as "chapters",
           "sections",  and  "subsections".   Chapter titles are  to be
           centered, in capitals, and underscored.   Section titles are
           to be flush with the left margin, upper- and lower-case, and
           underscored.   Subsection  titles are to be  "paragraph" in-
           dented,  upper- and lower-case,  underscored,  followed by a
           period, and run in with the text of the paragraph.  The body
           of the paper is to begin with a short "ABSTRACT" in the same
           style as a chapter.   For purposes of simplification, we are
           going to assume that the output is being produced at 6 lines
           to the  vertical inch  and 10  characters to  the horizontal
           inch.
0             Our objective in  this example is to write  a file called
           "ieee" which the author will imbed at the start of the input
           file for the  paper being produced.   This  "ieee" file will
           contain all  the SCRIPT control words  needed to set  up the
           formatting environment so that the  author's task in produc-
           ing the paper can be simplified to the point of producing an
           input file as shown in Figure 1.
0             The author imbeds  the "ieee" file,  enters  the text for
           the page-one title area without worrrying about the vertical
           or horizontal centering of that text in the title area,  and
           then uses  the commands we are  going to write as  MACROs to
           create the paper.   To begin,  we will write the SCRIPT con-
           trol words which  define the formatting environment  for the
           paper, as shown in Figure 2.
0             Note that, after "ieee" is imbedded, we are in "centered"
           mode,  and the  input text lines are being  formatted in the
           internal ".fb" workarea.  Also, there is a REMOTE waiting to
           be invoked at line 61 (page length minus bottom margin minus
           15) which will issue a ".cb" COLUMN BEGIN and cause the last
           15 lines (2.5")  of the first column to be left blank.   The
           ".abstract" MACRO (see Figure 3),  must terminate the ".fb",
           centre the floating-block lines at the  top of the page,  go
           into two-column mode, print the "ABSTRACT" title,  and start
           formatting the text.
0             The ".sk c" produces a "skip conditional":   a blank line
           which will only  exist if it is not  followed immediately by
           something  which  produces another  blank  line  (otherwise,
           SCRIPT will throw the conditional blank line away).   We can
           now  write  the  MACROs for  ".chapter",   ".section",   and
           ".subsection", as shown in Figure 4.

              The ".in"s  issued by  each of  these MACROs  are just  a
           "safety precaution"  in case  the author  left an  INDENT or
           OFFSET outstanding -- it depends on how much you want to try
           to protect people from themselves.

           5.2   AUTOMATING FOOTNOTES
+                __________ _________
0             The  SCRIPT ".fn"  (FOOTNOTE)  control  word handles  the
           placement of footnote text for you, but it does no more than
           that.   In this example, we will write a set of MACROs based
           on the ".fn" control word  to automate footnotes completely.
           We assume  that footnotes are  to be  numbered consecutively
           starting at "1",  and that if the document is being produced
           on the printer, a print train containing superscript numbers
           is being used,  but if the  document is being produced at an
           on-line terminal,  then such superscripts are not available.
           The MACROs we are going to  write will be called ".footnote"
           and ".footend",  and  we will use them in the  same way that
           ".fn begin" and ".fn end" are  used.   In order to translate
           footnote numbers to superscripts,  we need the control words
           shown in Figure 5.
0             The control words  shown in Figure 5  define 10 Reference
           Variables called "super1" through  "super0" whose values are
           the machine-code representations for  the superscript digits
           1 through 0.   The MACROs are  shown in Figure 6.   They are
           used as follows:
0               text, up to word to be
                .footnote referenced
                text of footnote
                .footend
                followed by rest of sentence
0          and produce the following result:

           tence
0             The ".footnote"  MACRO adds one  to the  footnote number,
           and if output is being produced  to the terminal,  creates a
           footnote symbol  consisting of the  footnote number  in par-
           entheses.   If output is to the printer,  it creates a foot-
           note symbol by converting each of the digits in the footnote
           number to its corresponding superscript representation.  The
           input line
0               .se x = '&x.&&&&super&&footnum(&i:&i)'
0          requires an explanation of  SCRIPT's "substitution scan" al-
           gorithm.   Each time SCRIPT encounters "&&",  it replaces it
           by a single "&" and then  continues scanning the input line.
           If the  footnote number  were "25"  and SCRIPT  were on  the
           first time through the ".pe",  then,   after one pass of the
           substitution scan algorithm,  the above line would have been
           reduced to
0               .se x = '&&super&footnum(1:1)'
0          and after the second pass, would have been reduced to
0          --------------------
