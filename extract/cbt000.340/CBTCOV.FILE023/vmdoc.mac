-    VM is run  in the WCC on  a 4381.   It is  used to test new  releas
     software and  to check  out system modifications  prior to  being p
     into production.
0    The only valid MVS logon ID's for VM are: MVS1, MVS2 and BUILD7.  B
     is reserved for use by the Control Program Services group while MVS
     MVS2 are available for any groups use.   The use of these systems s
     be scheduled with  the VM group via  the signup sheet to  avoid any
     flict.

     To schedule time for MVS testing under the 4381 VM system you need
     the following:
-            1. Logon to a valid CMS id.
             2. Enter the command: VMMVS
             3. A schedule will now be displayed and the cursor
                will be placed at the next available slot.
             4. Fill in all required fields (note: no spaces are
                allowed except in the additional requirements field).
             5. Hit the ENTER key and the table will be sorted by
                date and time and will be saved.
             6. Logoff CMS and wait for your scheduled time.

+    6.2   GLOBAL-LOCAL JES3
+          ____________ ____
-         1)  Preparation
              a) Insure that AUJSQ0 is mounted and available to VM.
              b) Check the JES3 initdeck JES3.PARMLIB(JES3IN00) to deter
                 the CTC addresses for your test.
              c) Do ISPF browse F DEVICE 1
              d) Find JNAME= cpu you desire and then
              e) Determine the CTC address that connects to the local
                 you are bringing up.  NOTE: It is the same in both
                 directions today but might change.
              f) Signup for 2 MVS VM id's.
              g) Determine the CPUid for your global and for your local
                 so that you can set the cpuid prior to ipl'ing MVS.
0         2)  Logon to 1 MVS VM system.
0         3)  Insure that AUJSQ0 is available to your VM MVS system
              as read/write (RW).
              a) If not then issue #CP ATT xxx SYSTEM AUJSQ0
                 where xxx is the address of AUJSQ0.  The address is
                 determined by issuing a #CP Q DASD AUJSQ0.
              b) Issue #CP LINK FULLPROD 120 320 MW WT for the first lin
                 or #CP LINK FULLPROD 120 320 MW MULT if another id
                 has linked to AUJSQ0.
0         4)  Logon to 2nd MVS VM system.
              a) Issue #CP SET CPUID xxxxxx
                 where xxxxxx is the CPUID of planned local.
              b) Issue #CP LINK FULLPROD 120 320 MW MULT for access to
                 AUJSQ0.
0         5)  Issue #CP DEF xxx CTC for both MVS systems
              a) From 1 of the systems issue:
                 #CP COUPLE xxx MVSy zzz
                 where xxx = the CTC address of the MVS system you are o
                       y   = the MVS id of the other MVS system
                 and   zzz = the CTC address of the other MVS system
0         6)  IPL normally as documented under MVS VM TESTING.
0         7)  Issue S JES3,Q=TEST and bring up your global processor fir
              Do a COLD start (reply C).
0         8)  Issue *S JSS after the system is up.
0         9)  Issue *V x,ON where x = the cpuname of the global.
0        10)  When the global processor is up, then IPL the local on the
              other MVS VM system.

         11)  Issue S JES3,Q=TEST and reply L to bring it up as a local.
0        12)  Issue *S JSS after the system is up.
0        13)  On the global processor: *V x,ON where x is the cpuname of
              the local.
0        14)  Verify that the JES3 classes you need are turned on for bo
              the global and local.
0        15)  Contact someone in the JES3 group if you have any question

          do not need to change any IPL parameters you can save the curr

          insure that the paging and spool packs will not be altered.
          To do this :
0         1) issue QUIESCE  - then wait for a wait state message
0         2) issue #CP SAVESYS MVSx  - where x = your VM id (1-4)
0         3) issue #CP LOGOFF when the savesys is completed
0         To recover from a SAVESYS:
0         1) Logon to VM
0         2) issue IPL MVSx - where x = your VM id
0         3) you are now exactly where you were when you did the SAVESYS

          To run TSO under VM :
0         First start VTAM. (See VTAM under VM)
0         Second issue S TSO
-         After TSO starts, you should have the VTAM salutation on the
          terminal attached as D50, to LOGON enter YAVMTSO.
0         After TSO is up issue EX 'AOST.CLIST(VMLOGON)' to set up
          the correct TSO Prefix.  See seperate documentation on VMLOGON
          in this document for further information.
0         NOTE: The prefix of AVMTSO is required so that you can allocat
          datasets and use ISPF plus.
0         Important NOTE:  You cannot access either your TSO or RAT volu
          so if you want any of these datasets then copy them to a pack
          is accessable from VM.
-         and have fun.............
-         NOTE: doing a #CP SAVESYS with NET active could cause problems
          when recovering due to changes in the VTAMLST.
