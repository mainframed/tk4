         MVS/Bulk Data Transfer Introduction and User's Guide



 INTRODUCTION

 MVS/Bulk Data Transfer, or MVS/BDT, is an offering of ISC to facilitate
 the transfer of large amounts of data from one computing center to anot
 using the Rockwell SNA communications network.

 MVS/BDT is a fast and efficient method of transfering either sequential
 datasets or partitioned data sets between centers.  Its use is encourag
 over the older BDT/IUP, also known as BDT/NJE, because MVS/BDT will
 transfer the data faster and will incur less cost per transfer.

 MVS/BDT is a system which is similar to JES3 in that it accepts work,
 known as jobs or transactions from the user, and schedules the work.  I
 has the ability to compress the data during the transfer to reduce
 transmission time, to checkpoint the data during transfer to reduce the
 amount of data which must be retransmitted if a transmission is
 interrupted, and facilities to ensure that a job or transaction is not
 lost if MVS/BDT is not active when the job/transaction is submitted.
 Informational messages regarding the status of a job/transaction are
 optionally available to the user (TSO only) or to an RJE console.

 To submit a job/transaction to MVS/BDT the user need only prepare a set
 of control cards which are passed to MVS/BDT via the BDTBATCH program,
 or issue a TSO command to pass the description of work to MVS/BDT.

 For complete information on how to use MVS/BDT from batch and/or TSO
 you should order the following IBM manuals:

     MVS/Bulk Data Transfer Facility: General Information Manual
           order number GC28-1313
     MVS/Bulk Data Transfer Facility: Writing and Using Transactions
           order number SC28-1321
     MVS/Bulk Data Transfer Facility: Messages and Codes
           order number GC28-1316

 Below is a description of how to submit a unit of work to MVS/BDT using
 the batch interface.  The TSO interface will be described after the bat
 Attached to the end of this document is a copy of the MVS/BDT Transacti
 Reference Summary which was prepared by Rockwell International.

 TRANSMISSION OF AN EXISTING DATASET

 A unit of work can be submitted to MVS/BDT by any batch job by using a
 program called BDTBATCH.  The JCL to execute this program is listed in
 Figure 1, and may be placed anywhere in a job after the dataset to be
 transferred has been created.

      ----------------------------------------------------------------
      //stepname EXEC PGM=BDTBATCH
      //SYSPRINT   DD SYSOUT=A
      //SYSIN      DD *
          --- control cards ---
      /*
      ----------------------------------------------------------------
                    Figure 1.  BDTBATCH JCL

 The control card keywords and parameters are very similar to JCL and to
 the TSO ALLOCATE command.  Let's assume the need to transfer a sequenti
 dataset from the WCC1 center to the SWC2 center.  The first control car
 would look like:

             //SYSIN DD *
             Q JOB(transaction-name)

 The Q indicates to MVS/BDT that the keywords and parameters on that
 control card, and those following, are a unit of work called a
 transaction.  Note that the term JOB and TRANSACTION are used
 interchangably.

 JOB defines the job/transaction name which MVS/BDT will use to manage t
 job/transaction.  If this keyword is not coded then the job/transaction
 name will be defaulted to AQJOB, which is almost meaningless.  It is
 recommended that the JOB keyword be coded.

 The job/transaction name should be some meaningful name.  For example t
 the naming conventions used for batch jobs might be used for MVS/BDT
 transactions.

 Next we need to define to MVS/BDT information about the dataset we want
 to transmit.  To do this we would code a second control card :

             //SYSIN DD *
             Q JOB(transaction-name)
             FROM LOC(WCC1) SHR DAP(SEQ) DSN(dataset-name)

 FROM tells MVS/BDT that the keywords which follow on the same and
 following control cards contain information defining the dataset to be
 transmitted.

 LOC defines the center on which the dataset resides.  Valid values are
 WCC1, WCC2, SWCC, SWC2, MCC and ECC.

 SHR is the disposition of the FROM dataset.  SHR indicates that MVS/BDT
 to access the FROM dataset with a disposition of SHR.  This allows othe
 jobs to still access the dataset.  A value of OLD may be coded which wi
 prevent others from accessing the dataset while MVS/BDT is transferring
 the dataset.

 DAP is used by MVS/BDT to define the dataset organization of the from
 dataset.  SEQ tells MVS/BDT that the from dataset is a sequential datas
 A value of PDS may be used if the from dataset is a partitioned dataset
 For any other dataset organization, such as BDAM, ISAM or VSAM, the
 dataset must be converted to a sequential dataset before MVS/BDT can
 transfer the dataset.  See the discussion on Non-Supported Dataset
 Organization Transfer below for information on how to transmit these
 datasets.

 DSN tells MVS/BDT the name of the dataset to be transmitted.

 Next we need to define the where the dataset is to be transmitted and w
 it is to look like once it gets there.  To do this we code the followin
 control cards:

      ----------------------------------------------------------------
             //SYSIN DD *
             Q JOB(transaction-name)
             FROM LOC(WCC1) SHR DAP(SEQ) DSN(input-dataset-name)
             TO   LOC(SWC2) SHR DAP(SEQ) DSN(output-dataset-name)
      ----------------------------------------------------------------
                    Figure 2.  SAMPLE BATCH TRANSACTION 1

 TO tells MVS/BDT that the keywords which follow on the same and followi
 control cards contain information defining the dataset which is to cont
 the output of the transfer.

 LOC defines the center on which the TO dataset resides.  Valid values a
 WCC1, WCC2, SWCC, SWC2, MCC and ECC.

 SHR is the disposition of the output dataset.  SHR indicates that MVS/B
 is to access the from dataset with a disposition of SHR.  This allows
 other jobs to still access the dataset.  A value of OLD may be coded wh
 will prevent others from accessing the dataset while MVS/BDT is writing
 into the dataset.  A value of MOD may be used if the data is to be adde
 to the end of an existing dataset.  Creating a new dataset will be
 discussed below.

 DAP is used by MVS/BDT to define the dataset organization of the receiv
 dataset.  SEQ tells MVS/BDT that the from dataset is a sequential datas
 A value of PDS may be used if the from dataset is a partitioned dataset

 DSN tells MVS/BDT the name of the receiving dataset.

 TRANSMISSION OF A NEW DATASET

 Let's now assume that we want to transfer the dataset from WCC1 to a ne
 dataset at SWC2.  We will need to define the characteristics of the new
 dataset to MVS/BDT.  To do this we will change the transaction we just
 built by replacing the definition of the TO dataset as follows:

      ----------------------------------------------------------------
             //SYSIN DD *
             Q JOB(transaction-name)
             FROM LOC(WCC1) SHR DAP(SEQ) DSN(input-dataset-name)
             TO   LOC(SWC2) NEW DAP(SEQ) DSN(output-dataset-name)
                  DISP(CATLG,DELETE) UNIT(3380) VOLSER(volume)
                  SPACE(10,10) BLOCK(1330) RECFM(FBA) LRECL(133)
                  BLKSIZE(1330)
      ----------------------------------------------------------------
                    Figure 3.  SAMPLE BATCH TRANSACTION 2

 We have changed the TO disposition from SHR to NEW, this tells MVS/BDT
 that the TO dataset must be allocated as a new dataset.

 The DISP keyword tells MVS/BDT that the new dataset is to be cataloged
 when the job/transaction has completed successfully, or deleted if the
 transfer is terminated abnormally.  Other parameters for this keyword m
 be found on the attached reference card.

 UNIT defines to MVS/BDT the device type of the output volume which is
 defined by the VOLSER keyword.  These should normally define a direct
 access device (DASD) as there are currently problems associated with ta
 transmission (see section below on Transferring Tape Datasets).

 SPACE tells MVS/BDT to allocate 10 blocks of 1330 bytes for a primary
 allocation and if needed, upto 15 additional units of 10 1330 byte bloc
 for the new dataset.

 BLOCK tells MVS/BDT that the dataset is to be allocated in blocks.  The
 value of BLOCK should always be the same as the BLKSIZE.

 RECFM, LRECL and BLKSIZE are the specified with the same parameters as
 JCL.  The record format (RECFM) is fixed-block with ASA carriage contro
 The size of each record (LRECL) is 133 and the size of the block to
 allocate (BLKSIZE) is 1330.

 If you have access to TSO, you should use ISPF option 3.2 to determine
 current DCB and SPACE information for the FROM dataset, which can then
 used when specifying the TO DCB and SPACE information.  If you do not h
 access to TSO then you should use a VTOC listing utility to determine t
 information.
1

 TSO SUBMISSION OF TRANSACTIONS

 To submit a transaction to MVS/BDT from a TSO terminal all that is need
 is to add the MVS/BDT TSO command name to the beginning of the transact
 control keywords.  For example to submit the tranaction shown in Figure
 via TSO you would enter on your TSO terminal the following:

      ----------------------------------------------------------------
             BDT Q JOB(transaction-name) FROM LOC(WCC1) SHR DAP(SEQ)
             DSN(input-dataset-name) TO   LOC(SWC2) SHR DAP(SEQ)
             DSN(output-dataset-name)
      ----------------------------------------------------------------
                    Figure 4.  SAMPLE TSO TRANSACTION

 The format of the dataset names conforms to standard TSO dataset naming
 conventions.  If the dataset name is not contained in quotes then the T
 prefix will be appended to the front of the dataset name to provide a
 fully qualified dataset name.  If the dataset name is contained in quot
 then it is assumed to be a fully qualifed dataset name.

 A complete, easy to use ISPF dialog is available via the Rockwell Menu
 under option C for those who have access to TSO and ISPF.
1

 STATUS MESSAGE CONSIDERATIONS

 Status messages will be returned to the TSO user for all transactions
 submitted via TSO.  These messages are not available by default for BAT
 submitted transactions.

 To receive status messages for BATCH submitted transactions the user mu
 code the following at any place within the transaction:

       MSGCLASS(NOTIFY)
       MSGCLASS(NOTIFY=userid)
       MSGCLASS(CON=center:terminal-id)

 NOTIFY tells MVS/BDT that all status messages are to be sent to the use
 who owns the batch job.

 NOTIFY=userid allows the specification of a userid other than the owner
 the batch job.  This should be used if the submittor does not have a
 registered TSO userid.

 CON=center:terminal-id tells MVS/BDT to send all status messages to a
 terminal or RJE terminal located at the specified center.  This may be
 used if all transactions are submitted from an RJE terminal and it is
 desired to have the RJE operator keep track of the status of the
 transactions.

 Note that all messages sent to other than the CON specification will be
 sent to the TSO userid using the SEND command.  This means that, if the
 user is logged onto TSO on the system where the transaction was submitt
 they will receive the message immediately.  If the user is not logged o
 or is not logged onto the system where the transaction was submitted, t
 the messages will be placed into the TSO BRODCAST file where it may be
 retrieved using the TSO LISTBC command.

 If you need complete messages concerning the status of a transaction,
 including the number of records transmitted and the from and to dataset
 name then you need to add the following to your transaction on both the
 FROM and the TO side or on the side which you are interested in:

       PARM(MSG=A)

 This will cause transaction start/stop, from/to dataset name, dcb and
 number of records sent and received messages to be generated.

 SENDING A PARTITIONED DATASET

 If you wish to transmit a partitioned dataset then the following must b
 coded:

      ----------------------------------------------------------------
             //SYSIN DD *
             Q JOB(transaction-name)
             FROM LOC(WCC1) SHR DAP(PDS) DSN(input-dataset-name)
             PARM(R=Y)
             TO   LOC(SWC2) NEW DAP(PDS) DSN(output-dataset-name)
                  DISP(CATLG,DELETE) UNIT(3380) VOLSER(volume)
                  SPACE(10,10) BLOCK(1330) RECFM(FBA) LRECL(133)
                  BLKSIZE(1330)
                  DIR(25) PARM(MSG=S) MSGCLASS(NOTIFY)
      ----------------------------------------------------------------
                    Figure 5.  SAMPLE NEW PDS BATCH TRANSACTION

 The differences from send a sequential dataset are:

      DAP(SEQ) must be changed to DAP(PDS)

      PARM(MSG=A) on the FROM side of the transaction must be changed
      to PARM(R=Y/N S/E M=(member,member)).

 DAP(PDS) tells MVS/BDT that the dataset you are sending is a partitione
 dataset.  The receiving dataset must also be partitioned.

 The PARM of R=Y indicates that like named members are to be replaced on
 the copy.  R=N indicates that they are not to be replaced.

 S indicates member selection.  E indicates member exclusion.

 M=(member,member) is a list of members to be selected or excluded.

 If you wish to transmit a complete PDS then code only R=Y or R=N.

 Note: If you code PARM(MSG=A) on the receiving side of the transaction
 will receive a message for every member successfully transmitted.  Also
 regardless of the PARM(MSG=A/S) on the receiving side of the transactio
 if R=N is coded then a message is generated for every member not
 transmitted due to a like named member in the receiving dataset.

 If sending to a NEW partitioned dataset then the following keywords are
 required on the TO side of the transaction:

      DIR(nnnn)

 This tells MVS/BDT how many directory blocks to allocate for the new PD
1


 SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

 MVS/BDT utilizes ACF2 to provide full security at the dataset level.  T
 means that if you want to send a dataset from one center to another, yo
 must have the correct ACF2 dataset access rules to do so.  If you do no
 then the transaction will terminate with an allocation return code
 indicating an allocation error and the transfer will not take place.


 DEPENDENT TRANSACTION NETWORKS

 DTC or Dependent Transaction Networks allow the user to control the
 execution one transaction based upon the success or failure of a previo
 transaction.

 The keywords which define the DTC network are:

      NETID(network-name)      Defines the DTC Network Name.
      NETREL(trans-name)       Defines the transaction names to be relea
                               when this transaction ends.
      NETHOLD(nnnnn)           Defines the hold count of the transaction
      NETCOND(x,x)             Defines what to do with this transaction
                               when a NETREL of a completed transaction
                               specifies this transaction.
                               Valid values for NETCOND are:
                                  D - Decrement hold count
                                  F - Flush this transaction and success
                                  R - Retain the hold count
                               The first is for normal completion and th
                               second is for abnormal.

 These keywords are normally specified immediately after the transaction
 name is specified in the transaction.

 See Figure 7 for an example of a DTC network.

 TRANSFERRING TAPE DATASETS

 There are a number of problems associated with utilizing MVS/BDT to
 transfer a tape dataset.  To avoid these problems the recommended
 technique is to first copy the tape dataset to a disk dataset for trans
 to a disk at the receiving center, and then copy the disk dataset back
 tape at the receiving center.

 To demonstrate how to do this, the JCL and MVS/BDT transactions are sho
 below.  Each logical section is shown and explained.

      ----------------------------------------------------------------
        Step1. Copying the Tape Dataset to Disk

        //stepname EXEC PGM=IEBGENER
        //SYSPRINT DD   SYSOUT=A
        //SYSIN    DD   DUMMY,DCB=BLKSIZE=80
        //SYSUT1   DD   DSN=tape.dataset,DISP=OLD
        //SYSUT2   DD   DSN=disk.dataset.data,DISP=(NEW,CATLG),
        //         UNIT=SYSDA,VOL=SER=volser,
        //         SPACE=(CYL,(10,10),RLSE)
      ----------------------------------------------------------------
                    Figure 6.  TAPE Transfer Step 1

 The SYSUT1 DD describes the tape dataset to be transferred.

 The SYSUT2 DD describes the disk dataset which will contain a copy of t
 tape dataset.  The disk dataset will be cataloged to simplify the build
 the MVS/BDT transaction.  The volser must be the volume serial number o
 direct access device (DASD) on which the dataset is to be allocated.
 The space allocations should be adjusted depending upon the amount of
 data contained in the tape dataset.

 NOTE: The SYSUT2 file can not be a temporary dataset.  It must be a
 permanent dataset. But it may be deleted once it has been transmitted b
 MVS/BDT.

 The next step is to submit to MVS/BDT a transaction to transmit the dis
 dataset to disk on the receiving center.  And then to submit to MVS/BDT
 transaction to copy a set of JCL to the internal reader at the receivin
 center to copy the disk dataset to tape.

      ----------------------------------------------------------------
        Step2. Submitting a DTC Net for the Transfer

        //stepname EXEC PGM=BDTBATCH
        //SYSPRINT DD   SYSOUT=A
        //SYSIN    DD   *
        Q JOB(TAPETR1) NETID(TAPEDTC) NETREL(TRAPTR2)
        MSGCLASS(NOTIFY=userid)
        FROM LOC(WCC1) DS(disk.dataset.data) OLD DISP(DELETE,KEEP) DAP(S
        TO   LOC(SWC2) DS(disk.receive.dataset) NEW DISP(CATLG,DELETE)
        UNIT(SYSDA) VOL(volser)  SPACE(10,10) RLSE CYL RECFM(FB)
        LRECL(80) BLKSIZE(6160) DAP(SEQ) PARM(MSG=A)
        /EOT
        Q JOB(TAPETR2) NETID(TAPEDTC) NETCOND(D,F)
        NETHOLD(1) MSGCLASS(NOTIFY=userid)
        FROM LOC(WCC1) DS(jcl.cntl(TAPEJOB)) SHR DAP(SEQ)
        TO   LOC(SWC2) INTRDR BLKSIZE(80) DAP(SEQ) PARM(MSG=S)
        /*
      ----------------------------------------------------------------
                    Figure 7.  TAPE Transfer Step 2

 Step 2 submits tso transactions to MVS/BDT utilizing a DTC network to
 insure that the second transaction does not execute until the first
 transaction ends.

 The first transaction will cause MVS/BDT to identify the transaction as
 TAPETR1.  And it will be part of the DTC Net TAPEDTC.  When TAPETR1 end
 it will release the DTC Net job TAPETR2.  All messages related to this
 transaction will be sent using the SEND command to the specified TSO
 userid.

 The FROM side of the transaction defines the dataset to be transmitted.
 This dataset is the copy of the tape dataset created in step 1.  Upon
 normal completion of the transaction the dataset created in step 1 will
 DELETE'd from disk.  If the transaction does not end normally due to an
 MVS/BDT abend situation then the dataset will not be deleted.

 The TO side of the transaction defines the receiving dataset at SWC2.
 is to be allocated NEW and will be cataloged if the transmission is
 successful, otherwise it will be deleted.  The volser defines the
 receiving DASD volume on which the dataset will be allocated.  Note tha
 the space should correspond to the amount of space specified in step 1
 when creating the copy of the tape dataset on disk.

 The /EOT tells BDTBATCH that it has encountered the end of one transact
 and that another transaction follows.

 The second transaction will cause MVS/BDT to identify the transaction a
 TAPETR2.  And it will be part of the DTC Net TAPEDTC.  When any predece
 transaction ends and releases TAPETR2, the hold count will be decrement
 by 1 allowing the transaction to be executed, otherwise if the predesso
 transaction failed then this transaction will be flushed from the syste
 (not executed).  All messages associated with transaction TAPETR2 will
 sent to the specified TSO user.

 The FROM side of the transaction defines a dataset containing a set of
 defining a JOB which is shown in Figure 8.

 The TO side of the transaction defines to MVS/BDT that the JCL read fro
 the FROM dataset is to be placed into the Internal Reader (INTRDR) at t
 receiving location.  When specifying the Internal Reader, BLKSIZE must
 coded as well.  The DAP(SEQ) defines the INTRDR as a sequential file.

 The JCL which will be submitted by the second transaction should look
 something like:

      Member TAPEJOB of dataset JCL.CNTL
      ----------------------------------------------------------------

        //jobname  JOB  .......
        //stepname EXEC PGM=IEBGENER
        //SYSPRINT DD   SYSOUT=A
        //SYSIN    DD   DUMMY,DCB=BLKSIZE=80
        //SYSUT1   DD   DSN=disk.dataset,DISP=(OLD,DELETE)
        //SYSUT2   DD   DSN=tape.dataset,DISP=(NEW,CATLG),
        //         UNIT=tape
        /*
      ----------------------------------------------------------------
                    Figure 8.  DISK to TAPE JCL

 This JCL will copy the dataset created by MVS/BDT at SWC2 from disk
 to tape, and then delete the disk dataset.

 The tape is now ready for use.

 NON-SUPPORTED DATASET ORGANIZATION TRANSFER

 To transfer a dataset other than PO or PS, you must first copy the data
 into a sequential dataset.  For VSAM you would use IDCAMS with the REPR
 control card, for ISAM you would use IEBISAM.  Or you can use any other
 utility which will convert the dataset to a sequential format.

 Next you would submit a DTC network of transactions similar those shown
 Figure 7.  These would be to 1) transfer the sequential file to the
 receiving center and then 2) to reload the sequential file into the
 correct datset organization using the appropriate utility to reverse th
 used at the sending center to convert the file to sequential format for
 transfer.

 USING TSO TO INQUIRY/CONTROL MVS/BDT

 A TSO user may issue MVS/BDT commands to inquire on the status of
 transactions, to cancel transactions, to hold transactions and to relea
 transactions.

 To INQUIRE on the status of an MVS/BDT transaction the format of the
 MVS/BDT TSO command syntax is:

    BDT I Q                        Inquire on all owned transactions
    BDT I A                        Inquire on all owned active transacti
    BDT I J=name                   Inquire on specific transaction name
    BDT I J=####                   Inquire on specific transaction numbe
    BDT I NET,ID=netid             Inquire on all transactions in netid

 To CANCEL a transaction the MVS/BDT TSO command syntax is:

    BDT F J/####,C                 Cancel a specific transaction
    BDT F NET,ID=netid,j=####,C    Cancel a DTC transaction
    BDT F NET,ID=netid,j=####,F    Cancel a DTC transaction and all
                                   successor transactions.

 To HOLD a transaction the MVS/BDT TSO command syntax is:

    BDT F J/####,H                 Hold a specific transaction
    BDT F NET,ID=netid,j=####,H    Hold a DTC transaction

 To RELEASE a transaction the MVS/BDT TSO command syntax is:

    BDT F J/####,R                 Release a specific transaction
    BDT F NET,ID=netid,j=####,R    Release a DTC transaction

 To Change the hold count of a DTC Transaction MVS/BDT TSO command synta
 is:

    BDT F NET,ID=netid,j=####,I    Increase the hold count by 1
    BDT F NET,ID=netid,j=####,D    Decrease the hold count by 1

 These commands will operate only on those transactions owned by the
 the TSO user issueing the commands.
1

 MVS/BDT RESTRICTIONS AND CAVEATS

 1. Transfer of datasets between two computing centers other than the
    center at which the transaction is submitted is not allowed.  This i
    called a third-party transfer since the submittor is not a part of t
    transfer.

 2. Only partitioned (PO) and sequential (PS) datasets may be transmitte
    directly by MVS/BDT.  All other dataset organizations must be
    reformatted into one of the supported dataset organizations prior to
    transfer.

 3. The direct transmission of a tape is not allowed.  To transfer a tap
    dataset it must first be copied to a direct access device.

 4. If sending a large dataset consisting of over 100 million bytes the
    transaction may time out.  To insure that the transfer completes
    successfully the TIME parameter should be coded.  For example a
    specification of TIME(10) might be used to send a 150 million byte
    dataset.  The default is TIME(5).

 5. The use of Generation Data Group's (GDG's) are not supported at this
    time.

 6. Status messages pertaining to the transaction are only available to
    TSO user by default.  A batch user must use the MSGCLASS keyword wit
    the appropriate parameters to receive status messages.
