0        These TSO commands,  programs,  clists,   etc reside in the lib
      documented in the section Where To Find.
0        Since the TSO commands do not reside in the LNKLSTxx you will h
      invoke them  using the dynamic  steplib commands.   These  command
      been placed in the linklist and require that 2 files be allocated
      ing to the desired steplib's.
0        File TASKLIB$ should point  to one or more libraries to  be use
      dynamic steplib by the $P and $C TSO commands.  This is a non-auth
      means of invoking commands or programs.
0        File TASKLIB@ should point to one  or more authorized libraries
      used as a dynamic steplib by the @P and @C TSO commands.  This is
      thorized means of invoking commands or programs.
-          Sample CLIST:
           PROC 0
           FREE F(TASKLIB$ TASKLIB@)

0        ISPF Panels have been created along  with related clists and pr
      to allow many of the utilities,  programs and TSO commands documen
      this manual to be executed under ISPF.
0        These may be used as is or you  may use them as models to creat
      own panels.
0     NOTE:  Many of these panels have an associated HELP panel.
0        If you wish to use these panels with your own then I suggest th
      allocate your  own ISPF libraries and  concatenate them before  th
      libraries using  the clist  below.   You could  then copy  ISP@MST
      AOST.ISPPLIB and add your own menu items.
-     Several of  the ISPF Panels  have been  modified to invoke  the SP
      program to establish selected variables on the first entry of the
      cation.   See  ISP@MSTR for details on  how to use this  program.

             you to directly enter the OS&T ISPF application.  It does t
             by  executing the  SYSCLIST  which in  turn  executes the
             erid.CLIST(LOGON).   This allows you to  have your own sess

            (e.g., no core left, i/o error...).
           The default number of lines in  SYSTERM for a no-error assem
            is now 2.  The "ASSEMBLER DONE" and the "NO STATEMENTS FLAGG
            are still printed, and the rest are suppressed.
           The DECKID (the  name field from the first title  card)  is
            also printed in  SYSTERM.   This is helpful if you  have don
            batched assembly and are trying  to determine which assembly
            responsible for an error message.
           MACRO/Copy Code Source Cross-Reference.   This is a list of
            SYSLIB data set names (in search  order),  and a listing of
            macros and copy code that were used from each.   The MACRO/C
            Code  Source  Cross-Reference  is  under  the  control  of
            [NO]MSRC parameter.   MSRC  (the default)  will allow  it to
            produced.
           DSECT  Cross-Reference.   Directly after  the  MACRO/Copy  C
            Source,   if NODXREF  is  not specified  (i.e.,   DXREF is
            default),  a listing of the DSECTs in the assembly is produc
            For each DSECT, its name, length (in bytes),  and the statem
            number where it is defined are given.
           At the  top of each  page,  the  current active USINGs  are
            printed on up to two subtitle lines.   These USINGs are curr
            as of the end of assembly of  the last instruction on the pr
            page.  These lines are under the control of the [NO]UMAP par
            eter.  UMAP (the default) will cause the USINGs to be printe
           The second  heading line  on each page  of the  actual assem

            with 'D-LOC' if IBMOUT is not in  effect and at the time of
            page eject the assembly was in a DSECT.

            ated error messages, rather than all the statements between
            call to the error.   The format for  SYSTERM is now the same
            that for SYSPRINT (i.e.,  it's not  all rearranged like the
            SYSTERM).
           At the end of each assembly listing, the number of utility f
            (SYSUT1) reads and writes are displayed,  along with the SYS
            SYSPRINT and SYSLIB counts which were displayed before.

               IEV056 - USING RENDERED NULL BY A PRIOR ACTIVE USING
            Given  the  rules  governing  base-displacement  resolution
            implied addresses (choose the register giving the smallest d
            placement,  and the highest-numbered such register),  this m

0          ASMH will now  accept WYLBUR pressed format  (with RECFM=U)
            input for both SYSIN and SYSLIB.   The concatenations of SYS
            may be  either RECFM=FB or RECFM=U,   or a mixture of  the t
            Another change to  SYSLIB processing is that the  data set w
            the largest block  size need not be first in  the SYSLIB con
            tenation sequence.
           An exit  is available just before  each line is  printed.
            exit routine name  is specified by 'PEXIT=XXXX'  in the invo
            tion PARM string.   XXXX is the module name of the exit rout
            in the PDS  pointed to by the EXITLIB DD  statement.   The e
            routine is called using standard  OS linkage conventions.
            parameter address list whose address is passed in R1 is:
                       A(the line to be printed)
                       A(the SYSPRINT DCB)

          sive halfwords,  will be described  below in the section "Chan
          to the Assembly  Language."  The line type flag is  a single b
          whose bits are defined as:

                        messages.
                 '04' - This line is part of the pre-assembly
                 '02' - SYSPRINT DCB open exit entry (occurs just before
                        the exit returns to finish the open).
                 '01' - This line is the first output line of
                        this assembly.
            (Note:  For the  open-exit call,  only the DCB  address and
            flag  byte address  are defined;   any nonzero  return code
            equivalent to 20.)
            When the  exit routine returns  control to the  Assembler,
            must contain  a return  code.   If  an invalid  return code
            returned, the exit will be turned off (i.e., never called ag
            for this assembly).  The valid return codes are:
                    0 - print the line in the buffer
                    4 - don't print the line in the buffer
                    8 - print the line and return back to the
                        exit with an empty buffer
                   12 - don't print the line and return with
                        an empty buffer
                   16 - final return for this line
                   20 - kill the exit (i.e., don't call again
                        for this assembly)
           The LRECL  of the SYSPRINT DCB  has been unhardwired  from 1
            This allows you  to specify any value greater than  or equal
            121.   (If the LRECL specified is less  than 121 it will be
            to 121.)   If you do specify a value larger than 121,  only
            first 121 bytes of each print  buffer will be properly blank
            It's up to you to blank or clear anything beyond 121.
           The DD name for the object deck  output data set for the Loa
            or Linkage Editor is now determined in  much the same way as
            ASMG.  The ASMH default DD name, SYSGO, can be overridden by
            alternate DD name list.  This name is searched for in the TI
            if it is found,  it will be used as the DD name.   If not,
            TIOT is searched for SYSGO or SYSLIN.   If either is there,
            one found will be used.  If both are there, SYSGO will be us
            If neither is there,  the DD name in the DCB will be left as
            and processing  will continue as  in the original  ASMH.   (
            above does not apply to ASMH under CMS).
           SYM cards are  now produced for equates whose  first operand
            relocatable and the LOCTR for that  operand is the current o

           The Assembler can now run  entirely in memory,  without SYSU
            By specifying  NODISK,  the  Assembler will  ignore SYSUT1
            attempt to run entirely with  internal buffering of informat
            that normally would be spilled to disk.   If there isn't eno
            memory for the assembly to be done this way,  it will be ter
            nated with a level 20 return code and a message.
            At the end  of each assembly,  the Assembler will  tell you
            much memory was allocated to buffers  and what it determines
            would  need to  do the  assembly completely  in memory.    T
            information  is provided  even when  you are  not running  w
            NODISK (i.e., DISK).
           Two  invocation parameters  have been  added  to control  PR
            statements that appear within an assembly source.  PRINTGEN,
            specified, will nullify any PRINT NOGENs embedded within a p
            gram source.  PRINTON does similarly, overriding PRINT OFFs.
           The invocation parameter OPCNTS will cause the opcode table
            the opcode  usage counts  to be  displayed at  the end  of e
            assembly.  The usage count displayed is the number of times
            opcode was searched for in the opcode table.
            Within the  Assembler,  the  opcodes are hashed  onto a  set
            chains.   For the  OPCNTS display,  the beginning  of each s
            chain is flagged by a "".
           The IBMOUT  parameter requires the Assembler's  SYSPRINT out
            to be similar to that of  the unmodified ASMH.   At the curr
            time,  IBMOUT really means NOUMAP,  NOMSRC and NODXREF.   If
            the future there are other options  that would change the li
            ing format, IBMOUT will reset them also.
           The parameters  INTEGER/DECIMAL and  FOLD/NOFOLD are  descri
            above,  in the  discussion of changes to input  and output h

0       Six new system variable symbols have been defined:
          (1) &SYSSTYP  -  a  character variable  containing  the  locat
              counter type ('CSECT'  or 'DSECT')  at the  invocation of
              current macro.  (This definition is the same as in ASMG.)
          (2,3) &SYSJOB, &SYSSTEP - both are character variables.   For
              they return the job name and the rightmost non-blank stepn
              in the TIOT.    For CMS,  they return 'NO JOB'  and 'NO ST
              respectively.
          (4) &SYSNEST - an arithmetic type  variable that returns the c
              rent macro  nesting level.   Level 0  is defined as  the o
              code level.    (The use of  &SYSNEST makes  writing recurs
              macros not only easier but much safer.  A recursive macro
              has a way of telling how "deep  in the weeds" it is,  and
              do something about it.)
          (5) &SYSMDSN - a character variable giving the source of the c
              rent macro.  The variable is 50 bytes long and is always p
              ded with  blanks on the right.    The first 6 bytes  give
              volume serial on which the macro was found, and the follow
              44 bytes are the data set name.   For CMS,  the DSN is onl
              bytes long and is the file name.
          (6) &SYSSTMT - an eight-byte character variable that contains
              statement number of the next statement to be generated.
              variable is always eight characters and is padded on the l
              with  zeros.   (The  significant digits  can  be obtained
              assigning &SYSSTMT to an arithmetic-type variable.)
        MACRO call statement  name fields need not contain  a valid Ass
         bler symbol.  If you desire to put a number, any string without
         embedded blank,  or any quoted string in the name field,  no er
         messages will be generated.
        There are  2 valid operands on  the AREAD statement that  were
         documented by IBM:  CLOCKB and CLOCKD.   They return the result
         a TIME BIN and TIME DEC (in the OS sense) respectively.
        The type attribute (T')  of a parenthesized expression like "(1
         is no longer 'N'.   It is set to 'U' like it should be.   The o
         thing that has  type attribute 'N' is a  truly self-defining te
         (Try  generating DC  H'10E(10)' from  within a  macro because
         Assembler "told" you that the T'  of "(10)" was 'N'.   (For any
         that may need the old definition,  there is the OLDTYPE invocat
         parameter.)
        In LCLx/GBLx  statements,  the  "&" preceding  the variable  na
         being declared is no longer required.  The absence of the "&" w
         cause a level 0 warning message to be generated.  This can be s
         pressed by running ASMH with FLAG set to greater than 0.
        The macro language has 2 new  opcodes:   ASPACE and AEJECT.   T
         provide services analogous  to SPACE and EJECT,  but  only for
         listing of in-line macro source code.  ASPACE, unlike its assem

0       The <NO>MSOURCE operand  may be specified on  the PRINT stateme
         If PRINT  NOMSOURCE and PRINT  GEN are  both in effect,   the b
         (columns 1  - 71)  of each  macro-generated statement will  not
         printed.   If you write code rich in macro calls, it's nice to
         the addresses and  the generated code on the left  of the listi
         but the body  of each statement can be  fairly meaningless;  he
         you may not want it printed.
        The underscore (_)  has been added  to the list of characters t
         ASMH allows in symbols.  It is treated the same as a numeric di
         as far as where it may and may not appear in symbols and in ope
         tion codes and macro names.   The  common use is to separate wo
         in labels or identifiers (don't forget, ASMH allows identifiers
         up to 63 characters).
        A new  machine instruction  operation code has  been added  for
         users - DIAG  (DIAGNOSE).  DIAG is treated as  an RS-type instr
         tion:
                   DIAG   r1,r3,d2(b2)
        The Assembler instruction statement opcode  OCTL provides a way
         passing  parameters to  the  print exit.    There  are 4  opera
         allowed on  an OCTL statement,  each  of which must evaluate  t
         16-bit absolute expression.   These are evaluated and put into
         corresponding halfwords of the OCTL values passed to the exit r
         tine designated by  the PEXIT parameter.   Each operand  may be
         three forms:   an absolute expression;   an expression of the f
         *N (where * is taken to be  the current value for that OCTL po
         tion to which  N is either added or subtracted);   or null,  wh
         means leave the current value as is.   Note:  The Assembler pla
         no meaning  on the operand values;   it simply evaluates  them
         passes them to the print exit.   For a missing (null) operand,
         value that was there before is left untouched.
        A new operand, NOPRINT, has been added to the PUSH, POP, and PR
         pseudo instructions.   If you specify 'NOPRINT' the statement w
         not be printed, as you would expect.
        Qualified USINGs (or, more properly,  Labeled USINGs and Qualif
         Symbols),   are a  major new  capability of  ASMH,  allowing  m
         greater control over  the resolution of symbolic  expressions i
         base-displacement form with specific base registers.
         The mechanics of this facility are  rather simple.   First,  pu
         label on  a USING  statement.   Then,  to  force the  Assembler
         resolve a symbol  into base-displacement form through  that USI
         qualify the  symbol by preceding it  with the label on  the USI
         followed by a period.   An example of Labeled USINGs and Qualif
         Symbols would be:

                 MVC     PRIOR.DCBLRECL,NEXT.DCBLRECL
         Without labeled USINGs,  this would have to be written in the a
         ward and inelegant form:
                 USING   IHADCB,R10

                 MVC     DCBLRECL-IHADCB(,R10),DCBLRECL-IHADCB(R2)
         Another example of the use of labeled USINGs is:

                 USING   X,R10,R11

         The usual  way of symbolically  referencing parts  of a DCB  is
         load the address of the DCB into Rn followed by "USING IHADCB,R
         Such a  technique requires  you to allocate  an extra  register
         hold the address of the DCB.  With labeled USINGs, you are able
         utilize already allocated registers (in  this case,  the progra
         base registers).   This technique works  because the two USINGs
         not interfere with each other,  even  though they specify the s
         registers; see below for details.
         The label on a USING may not appear in the name field of any ot
         statements except that of other USINGs.    If a label appears o
         USING, any other USING with the same label is nullified.
         As is the case with non-labeled USING statements, a symbol (in
         first operand)  or  a register (in any of  the remaining operan
         may appear in any number of USINGs.  However, in the case of qu
         ified USINGs,  as long as all  the USINGs have unique labels,
         are considered active and are eligible to be used as qualifiers
         There is a very basic concept about Labeled and non-Labeled USI
         that needs to be understood.    In non-Labeled USINGs,  a regis
         implies data,   in the sense  that a  register may imply  only
         piece of data at a time (i.e.,  when a register that appeared i
         USING appears in another USING, the prior USING is nullified).
         Labeled USINGs the reverse is true:   the data implies a regist
         That is,   a single register may  appear in multiple  USINGs,
         being active, so long as all the USINGs have unique labels.  (N
         lification of  Labeled USINGs  occurs only  when a  repeated La
         appears, not when a repeated register appears.)
         Labeled USINGs do not interfere with non-labeled USINGs.  When
         Assembler resolves an implied address into base-displacement fo
         either the expression to be resolved was qualified or not.   If
         was, the specified labeled USING will be used.  If not, the act
         non-labeled USINGs will be scanned in the standard manner, look
         for a resolution.
         A label on a USING defines an environment.  As such, when you w
         to nullify (delete)  that environment,  you must DROP the envir

         ment's name,  the USING's label.   An attempt to nullify a labe
         USING by  dropping its  registers will  result in  those regist
         being dropped instead from the non-labeled USING pool.   You wo
         nullify the Labeled USINGs from the example above by writing:
                DROP   PRIOR,NEXT
        Ten new extended branch mnemonics have  been added to the exist
         set.   The new mnemonics are BGT, BGE, BEQ,  BLE,  BLT,  and th
         RR-type BCR counterparts BGTR, BGER, BEQR,  BLER,  and BLTR.
         corresponding branch mask digits are 2, 10, 8,  12,  and 4 resp
         tively.
        Literals and  where they  may appear has  been made  slightly l
         restrictive.   For machine instructions (and only machine instr
         tions)   a literal  may appear  anywhere a  relocatable symbol
         valid.   The exception  to this is that the length  attribute o
         literal is still undefined.  An example of this might be:
                   LA   R1,=C'??'-24           get parm for ADT lookup
        AOPTION  - a  new opcode.   Given that  the invocation  paramet
         really only define  a default assembly environment,   AOPTION p
         vides a means to specify  a specific statement-by-statement ass
         bly environment.    AOPTION may be used  as many times  as desi
         during an assembly whether batched or  not.   (TEST and NOTEST
         currently the only valid operands.)
         Now,  at the end of each assembly,  all the ASMH options are re
         to their invocation values.  This  means that an environment mo
         fied through AOPTION will not affect the next assembly in a bat
        The length attribute (L')  used on  a machine instruction withi
         macro definition now behaves the same as that of ASM-F.  (A sta
         ment such as:
                 TM    &X,L'&X
         used to cause  the  Assembler to think that it had  the letter
         followed by an improperly quoted string.)
        Both the scale attribute (S') and the integer attributes (I')
         may also be used in open code.  Both their definitions are iden
         cal to those for use within macro definitions.
        Errors in the invocation parameters are diagnosed better.  Inst
         of getting a "There is an error  in the parm list" message (at
         end of the assembly), the actual parms in error will be display
         In an OS environment,  this display  will be sent both to SYSPR
         and to SYSTERM.   (Note: In CMS, SYSTERM is assigned to the ter
         nal.)
         More important, as soon as the assembler recognizes that it has
         erroneous parm,  a warning message and  the erroneous parm will
         sent to the terminal.   (This way,   if the parm is critical,
         assembly can be aborted before wasting a lot of time.)
        Associated  USING  statements  provide   additional  control  o
         address expression resolution.  The format  of an Associated US
         is:
         <label>   USING    S1,S2
         <label> if present, makes this a labeled Associated USING (see
         discussion of  labeled USINGs above).  S1  is an expression  to
         interpreted in the same way as in any other USING.  S2 is a sec
         address expression specifying where S1 is to be based.

         An example of the use of an Associated USING might be:
         X       CSECT
                 USING   X,R10,R11  NORMAL USING
                 .
                 .
                 USING   IHADCB,DCBUT2        ASSOCIATED USING
                 LH      R0,DCBBLKSI          USES R10 OR R11 FOR BASE
                 .
                 .
         DCBUT2  DCB     DDNAME=SYSUT2,...
         Note that this is another (simpler) solution to the problem sol
         in the second example in the description of Labeled USINGs.
         The difference between ordinary USINGs, Labeled USINGs,  and As
         ciated USINGs is the following.    In ordinary situations,  a p
         grammer must assign several registers for addressing purposes,
         provide USING  statements to allow  the Assembler to  make addr
         resolution decisions.   Labeled and Associated USINGs allow you
         restrict the  Assembler's decisions  and to  reduce the  number
         registers needed for addressing.
         With ordinary USINGs,  a given  expression may be addressable w
         several registers;  Labeled USINGs provide qualifiers that let
         specify exactly which USING is to  be used to resolve that expr
         sion.   Thus,  Labeled USINGs can be viewed as a way to reduce
         freedom with  which the  Assembler chooses  among the  "availab
         registers.
         Conversely,  Associated USINGs  allow you to reduce  the number
         registers that  must be  assigned to  addressing,  but  allows
         Assembler freedom to  choose the register.   If an  area of mem
         customarily mapped by one register  is addressed by another,  o
         the second  need be used for  address resolution;  the  mapping
         specified in an Associated USING, as in the above example.
        Qualifiers (from labeled USINGs) are now cross referenced.
        All the mnemonics  listed in GA22-7000-7 (the edition  of the S
         tem/370 Principles  of Operation  relevant to  the 3081)   are
         defined in  the opcode table.    The added opcodes  include:  B

-     2.5.1   Description
+     2.5.1   Description
+             ___________
-          This is a utility which converts an assembler listing
           dataset into a formatted AMASPZAP input deck or SMP PTF. It
           is useful in preparing, maintaining, and documenting those
           installation modifications which cannot be installed execpt
           by modifing IBM code. One can make free use of macros,
           literals, and other convenience features in preparing the
           deck.  Control cards in special assembler comment form
           provide flexability in modification design and control
           over output.
0          All control cards are included in the assembler deck
           beginning with the characters '*ZAP'. The purpose of the
           control cards is to interrupt and resume generation of
           ZAP output.  Statements which do not generate object code
           (comments,ORG,DS,EQU,etc.) are transferred to the output as
           ZAP comment cards, unless output generation is currently
           paused.  Other statements (instructions,DC,CCW,etc.) are
           transferred to the output as 'VER' or 'REP' cards if
           output generation has been (re)started in one of these
           two modes.  The cards governing this are:
0               *ZAP START REP
                *ZAP START VER
                *ZAP PAUSE
0          ZAP generation is initially paused.  A '*ZAP START' card is
           valid and (re)starts generation in REP or VER mode, whichever
           was last active, but if it is the first START card in the
           deck, it cannot be followed by object generating statements
           until mode is specified on a subsequent '*ZAP START (VER/REP)
           card.
0          When the ZAP is done, a '*ZAP END' card will terminate
           a scan of the listing and close the output file.  This not
           only saves a few extra microseconds of CPU which would be
           spent scanning the mapping macros and cross refrence, but
           helps the human reading the assembler to know where the
           essential code has stopped and the support definitions
           have begun.  It takes a lot of ZAP comment cards to define
           the CVT DSECT.
0          The '*ZAP CARD' control card allows arbitrary text to
           be reproduced in the output.  The characters up to the

           space after 'CARD' are stripped off and the remainder of
           the card to column 72 is reproduced in the output deck.
           This is primarily for NAME, DUMP, and SMP control cards.

+     2.5.2      Restrictions:
+                ____________
0           1.  You must specify 'PRINT DATA' in the assembly if you
                generate constants or literal in excess of 8 bytes
                length.
            2.  Remember to put the 'LTORG' statement before the
               '*ZAP END' card if literals are generated.
            3.  No relocatable address constants can be coded in the
                ZAP card.
           It is not possible at this time to detect violations of the
           restrictions listed above. Be careful.

              EQU instructions.  They can be easily modified when hit by
              PTFs or when the next release is distributed.  Candidates
              include the zapped over instruction, the patch area, and
              targets of conditional branch instructions other than the
              natural return.
0             It is sometimes possible to imbed the ZAP instructions in
              enough support code to make the object deck output of
              the assembly an independently executable program which
              you can TSO TEST before incorporating into the system.
              This saves a little system test time tracking down DATA
              exceptions and the like.

+            _______ _ _______ ___ ______
0               Compare Two Versions of an Assembler Language Module
-     Function:
0     COMPASM compares two versions of an assembly language source modul
      is especially well suited to cases where the two versions differ s
      icantly.  The content of the source code  is used to make an intel
      comparison. Sequence numbers are not normally used.  The differenc
      tween the  two modules  are printed  and/or punched  as an  update
      Statistics on the extent of the differences are also printed.
-     Parameters:
0     All   parameters   are   optional.     Parameters   are   specifie
      PARM='PLIPARMS/PGMPARMS'.  PGMPARMS must be preceded by a "/".
-     PLIPARMS:
      ISASIZE(amount) (default ISASIZE(500K))
          ISASIZE specifies the initial storage area obtained by PLI.
          Performance is improved slightly if a large enough value is
          specified. It may be calculated as 164*SIZE+4500 (see
          PGMPARM SIZE).
0     PGMPARMS:
      COLUMN=column-number (default COLUMN=72)
          COLUMN specifies the number of columns used for comparison.
      DECKNODECK (default NODECK)
          DECK specifies that an update deck is to be written to file
          SYSPUNCH.
      FORMAT=<SMPUPDATE> (default FORMAT=SMP)
          SMP specifies that the deck is to be in SMP format. UPDATE
          specifies that the deck is to be in IEBUPDTE format.
      INCR=sequence-increment (default INCR=10)
          INCR specifies the interval between sequence numbers for
          inserted cards written to SYSPUNCH.
      LINECOUNT=page-SIZE (default LINECOUNT=55)
          LINECOUNT specifies the number of lines per page on
          SYSPRINT and SYSTERM.
      LISTNOLISTLIST=ALL (default LIST)
          LIST specifies that a report of module differences is to
          written to SYSPRINT. LIST=ALL specifies that the listing
          will include cards which are the same in both modules.
      MODID=modification-id (default MODID=        )
          MODID specifies a character string which will be punched in
          columns 64-71 of comments cards used for deletion when
          FORMAT=SMP is specified.
      SEQFLD=ccl (default SEQFLD=738)
0           Page 49    Operating System and Technology Utilities Manual
1
-
          SEQFLD is used when a portion of the sequence field in
          columns 73-80 is non-numeric.  'ccl' specifies the COLUMN
          (cc) and length (l) of the numeric portion of the sequence
          field.
      SIZE=module-SIZE (default SIZE=3000)
          SIZE specifies the number of cards in the larger module.
      TERMNOTERM (default NOTERM)
          TERM specifies that statistics and error messages will be
          written to file SYSTERM.
-     Input files:
0     All input files must be sequential or a member of a partitioned da
      must be RECFM=FB, LRECL=80.
0     OLD (required)
         OLD is the "original" version of the module.
      NEW (required)
         NEW is the "modified" version of the module.
      SYSIN (optional)
         SYSIN is used when DECK is specified. It is copied to the
         beginning of SYSPUNCH. If SYSIN is omitted, an UPDATE
         ./ CHANGE NAME=module-name card is punched.
-     Output files:
0     SYSPRINT (required)
         SYSPRINT is a report of module differences and statistics.  Add
         cards are flagged with +++, and deleted cards are flagged with
         It must be RECFM=VBA, LRECL=125.
      SYSTERM (optional)
         SYSTERM is used when TERM is specified. It is a subset of SYSPR
         for TSO terminal use. It contains just statistics and error mes
         It must be RECFM=VBA, LRECL=125.
      SYSPUNCH (optional)
         SYSPUNCH is used when DECK is specified. It is an update deck i
         or IEBUPDTE format which converts the "old" module into the "ne
         module. It must be RECFM=FB, LRECL=80.
-     Method of operation:
0     Both modules  are read into  arrays in  main storage.  The  progra
      builds cross-reference arrays  which point to matching cards  in t
      modules.  Multiple passes are made over the source text.  The firs
      compares cards which are most likely  to be unique.  Each subseqen
      compares cards which are progressively less likely to be unique.
-
0            Operating System and Technology Utilities Manual   Page 50

      The first  pass identifies source macros  and open code.  Each  ma
      compared separately.   Each matching macro or  open code is  scann
      cards with  sequence symbols.  Then  between matching  sequence sy
      cards are scanned  for names.  Cards between matching  names are s
      for  non-trivial cards.    Finally trivial  cards  are compared  b
      matching non-trivial cards.  Trivial cards are either comments wit
      ple patterns of repeated characters or assembler control statement
      as EJECT or SPACE.
0     A report and/or deck are then produced using the cross-reference a
      Statistics are printed on the results of the comparison.

+              ___________
-        This program is used to compare two  versions of the same sourc
      gram.   It  will compare columns  1 through  72 or optionally  col
      through 80.   The optional file, IGNORE, may be used to instruct C
      to ignore specified card images in the data sets being compared.
      port of the comparison is written to  the SYSPRINT file.   If the
      is directed to a TSO terminal, only the first 78 characters of eac
      are written.   This  may not be desirable  if you are using  a har
      terminal.
0        The COMPARE program  uses only columns 1 through 72;   thus,  a
      versions of a program  may be easily compared even if  one (or bot
      the files has been resequenced.  If neither file has been resequen
      PARM of "FULL" may  be coded to request that all  eighty columns b

      images (such  as " EJECT "  or " SPACE 3  " in an assembler  sourc
      gram).
0        This program uses all available core  in its region after openi
      input/output files (except for 4k which is released).  The obtaine
      area is used as  a compare buffer which is only  dumped (written t
      PRINT) when identical records (based on the first 72 bytes) are fo
      the old and new data sets.  If the compare buffer overflows, the p
      terminates.  Therefore, if it is suspected that the two data sets
      very far out of sync, a large region should be used.   The number
      matched records that can be buffered at  one time can be calculate
      the expression:   (region size - 8k - buffers)  / 160 as a general
      30k is sufficient for about 100 unmatched records at a time, and 1
      sufficient for about 500 unmatched records at a time.
0        Card images of the trival data is input from the IGNORE file.
      IGNORE DD statement  is missing,  a table of trivial  data for ass
      source code  will be assumed  which includes " EJECT  ",  " SPACE
      SPACE 1 ", " SPACE 2 ", " SPACE 3 " and blank comment cards.

      log in order  to use  the  existing  access   methods  most effect
      Multiple input and  output catalogs are  processed   and the redis
      tion  of  the  entries  is  under  user control. Model DSCBs for g

0        COPYCAT is an OS utility program   designed  to  produce  an ef
      system  wide catalog which may reside on many volumes.   Substanti
      provement in performance may also be obtained  on a system  with
      single catalog. This is accomplished in a number of ways.   First,
      log  entries  from  many  different  catalogs  may  be  redistribu
      equalize  the load on each individual  catalog.  Second,   each in
      ual   catalog    is restructured in a  way designed to minimize  t
      time required both  for  searching   and  updating.   The redistri
      and restructuring   parameters  are  under the control  of the  us
      should have some knowledge of OS catalog management.
0        Our installation  at Argonne consists of  a 370/195,  used  for
      processing,   and a 360/75 used for time sharing.  The time sharin
      tem, tso, shares all its online devices with the 195.   Since  all
      sets  used  by  tso  must be cataloged,  they are cataloged on the
      dent volume  for the 75  to allow batch   jobs to  access  tso dat

      monitoring showed the  percent of unit busy time of  the system re

      after an index  may be specified so  the index can expand  and new
      level indexes can be added in close proximity.  Third,   the  numb
      blocks that  must  be  on a track  before starting the next index

+     2.19.6   Program Logic
+              _______ _____
0        COPYCAT is written entirely in assembler language.  QSAM  is us
      SYSPRINT and SYSIN,  while bsam in the  load mode is used for the
      datasets.  BDAM  is  used   for  the  input   and  to  access prev
      written output blocks.
0        The heart  of the program consists  of  a  recursive   routine
      rr,  which is called for each level.  The  TTR of the first block
      level is passed to rr.  After an  index  is  written with  the old
      it is reread and  for each entry with a lower  level,  rr is recur
      called.   Upon return,   the   new  TTR  is placed in the  entry a
      block is rewritten.
0        When processing the highest  level  index,   the  additional in
      tion of  which  input  dataset this entry  came from must also be
      This is done  by changing the count  field  of  the index.    Only
      types of entries need this information saved:   the index pointer
      the volume CONTROL block pointer entry, and the generation index p
      entry. By making the last three bits of the volume CONTROL block p
      entry '110',   only  the entries  with  a  last bit of '0' contain
      tional information.    Two bits  are used  to distinguish   betwee
      three  types  of entries,  and  the  other five bits in the length
      are then used to locate the proper input dataset.
0        When processing  model  DSCBs,   the  obtain,   allocate  and s
      svcs   are   used.    Before   running  COPYCAT,   local restricti
      allocating and  scratching  datasets  should  be considered.  Thes
      are  only  used  in the routine called gdsproc.
0        Two other important routines are INR and  PUTC.   INR  finds th
      name in the highest level indexes to be processed from among all t
      puts.  It is called by  rr  and   it  handles  the problem  of dup
      index names. PUTC is also called by rr and it takes an index and a
-           Page 69    Operating System and Technology Utilities Manual

      to the next block for output. PUTC processes the parameters of the

0        DISASM is a one-pass disassembler which produces an assembler
         language source program from a CSECT within a load module.  Con
         cards permit specification of areas containing no instructions,
         base registers to be provided so that symbolic labels may be cr
         during disassembly, and definition of dsects to be used during
         disassembly. Conditional branch instructions use the extended
         mnemonics, where possible, and explicit registers are denoted b
         R1, ... R15. Informational comments are given on SVC's, and var
         BAL instructions to aid in creating a documented source program

            instructions should be generated (only constants), and make
            data-only cards for these ranges. If you can determine any
            registers that are bases for areas which can be used for dse

0         The disassembler is composed of three modules. The first is
          called DISASM. The second phase is DISASM1, and the third is
          DISASM2. The second and third phases are load'ed and performed
          by a BALR 14,15 from DISASM.
-            DISASM Functions:
0            . Process the parm field, if any: set indicators used by DI
               and DISASM2 to set up their instruction tables.
             . Open all files.
             . Get storage for the symbol table, RLD table, and data-onl
               tables (109,544 bytes total).
             . Process the module-csect card to obtain the member and CS
               names.
             . Issue BLDL against SYSLIB to obtain directory info for th
               member specified. If the specified member is an alias, re
               a BLDL for the real member. Print directory information.

               precedes each block of text.  RLD Info for the text follo
               each text block. Processing of load module information is
               follows:
               a. Build an external symbol table, using the cesd blocks.
               B. Search for the desired CSECT as the table is being bui
                  This CSECT must be found before the first control reco

                  found (by ESD-id).
               D. When found, issue GETMAIN for an area large enough to
                  contain the entire text.
               E. Place text blocks in contiguous storage locations and
                  maintain during disassembly.
               F. Use RLD information for the CSECT to build the RLD tab
             . Load and perform DISASM1.

             . Print the final label table to be used during disassembly
             . Load and execute DISASM2.
             . Generate the DSECT entries.
             . Generate the REQU macro and end statements

0           At EOF on SYSIN, a pseudo dis-assembly pass is made using th
            stored by DISASM.  Any resolvable address within the text is
            to create a new entry in the label table, which will be used
            DISASM2 in the actual dis-assembly pass.
0           Disassembly tables are set up similarly to those used by DIS
            for the simulated disassembly performed in this module when
            program base register using statements are entered.
0           Storage is obtained for the DSECT table and using table, and
            addresses of these tables are stored in the common parameter
            Using and DSECT cards are edited, reformatted, and placed in
            appropriate tables.  If any errors are found, they are print
            and the disassembly will be terminated on return to DISASM.
0           Storage is obtained for the label table, and a simulated
            dis-assembly is performed to create label table entries for
            which will be generated for base-displacement addresses by
            DISASM2.  On return to DISASM, these labels will be sorted w
            external symbol and RLD labels to form the final label table

            A text byte is considered to be an instruction if it occurs
            halfword boundary, is a valid op-code, and is followed by a
            op-code.  Unconditional branches need not be followed by a v
            op-code, however.  The privileged and floating point instruc
            are not treated as instructions unless the user specified th
            inclusion at EXEC time.

-       Description:  This program formats information on any disk data
            set.  It reads through the entire data set and outputs disk
            track usage, record sizes, counts and other statistics.
0           In addition, several data set validity checks are performed
            during input processing to insure that the data set will be
            usable by the system for non-excp processing.
0           If any errors are encountered, the return code is set to 409
            (or the program abends); otherwise, the return code is set
            to the minimum of 4094 and the number of tracks which should
            compress out for partitioned data sets.
-
        Definitions (for partitioned data sets):
0           A.  Real member - a non-alias member name which is present i
                the directory.
0           B.  Gas member - a member of a partitioned data set which ha
                been replaced or deleted from the data set.  A gas membe
                does not have an entry in the directory pointing to it;
                disk storage occupied by gas members is made usable for

                             data set reads are to be performed (except
                             the read for any ISAM format 2 DSCB).
0           B.  Nogas      - no gas member report is to be provided for
                             partitioned data sets.
0           C.  Errorsonly - only error messages are to be output.
0           D.  Allextents - all extents of the data set are to be read
                             regardless of the ds1lstar setting.

0           D.  Additional processing:
0               1. For physical sequential, direct or VSAM data sets, no
                   additional processing is performed.
0               2. For ISAM data sets, the program reads through the
                   entire data set (there may be several files of data)
                   and reports on each file.  Also, the program inputs
                   the ISAM label (format two DSCB) record and provides
                   a data set profile which includes data set
                   reorganization data and data set characteristics.
0               3. For partitioned data sets, if the data set name and a
                   member name is allocated to the input data set, the
                   member is processed like a sequential data set.
0               4. For other partitioned data sets, the program compares
                   directory TTR's against actual disk addresses to
                   provide a report by gas member:
                   a.  For load libraries, the linkage-edit date and the
                       names of the first few csects are provided.
                   B.  For other libraries, the first 79 characters of
                       each gas member is output.
                   Statistics are maintained on the size of gas and real
                   members and the number of alias members.  DSTATS chec

            Version 2.0: Added more statistics:
0             A.  Added the allextents and errorsonly parm controls
0             B.  Added VSAM support
0             C.  Added record size distribution outputs
0             D.  Added LRECL statistics and validity checks.
0             E.  Added creation, expiration and last use dates.
0             F.  Supported disk devices: 2305-1, 2305-2, 2314,
                  3330, 3330-1, 3340, 3350, 3375 and 3380.
0             G.  Added more information for I/O and other error conditi
0             H.  Added support for track overflow data sets.
0             I.  Unprintable characters (for a 3270-type device) in the
                  output are translated to periods.
-             J.  Made the following changes for partitioned data sets:
0                 1.  Added gas module linkage-edit date and csect names
0                 2.  Fixed a bug: the reported TTR of gas members was
                      sometimes incorrect (a track switch check was miss
0                 3.  Enhanced the compress algorithm: instead of esti-
                      mating potential free tracks from (total gas size)
                      (average bytes on a track); a compress is now simu
                      lated.  The former calculation worked well only fo
                      libraries with blocksizes which did not vary.
0                 4.  Added directory block statistics.
0                 5.  Added a check for apparent alias members (two real
                      members with the same TTR).
0                 6.  Added real and gas member total byte counts.
0                 7.  The member table is now dynamically allocated; its
                      size is doubled each time it is exceeded.

-         The basic tool you can  use to determine  what is wrong  with
          catalog is IDACATCK. This program is a catalog analysis progra
          which validity checks catalog records  for proper  chaining an
          content. IDACATCK   will  identify  common  types   of  catalo
          corruption and many others  not so  common. However,  it canno
          check everything so there may be some dammage which it will no
          identify. Also, you  must  be aware  that  IDACATCK cannot  ru
          against a catalog that is damaged to  the point where it  is n
          longer a valid VSAM dataset. Generally  this type of  damage i
          caused by an overlay  of catalog records  with some  other dat
          causing physical I/O errors attempting to access the data. Thi
          document does not attempt to provide guidance to  the repair o
          this type of damage.

0         If errors are detected, the program generally produces a suffi
          cient amount of information to allow the problem to be analyse
          If not, one or more of the following might help:
          1. IEHDASDR or AMSAPZAP dump to SYSPRINT of parts of catalog.
          2. AMS Print of parts of catalog (use count, fromkey, and
             tokey to restrict output).
          3. IDACATFX dump or display of parts of the catalog either
             by CI number or RBA.
          4. IDACATFX dump of the index portion of the catalog. (IDACATF
             Is the only tool that will provide this)
          5. VSAM Record management trace facility. (IDATRACE)
          6. Catalog management CVT trap (see diagnostic aids section of
             catalog management plm or catalog section of MVS Debugging
             Techniques).
0         Once the problem has been analysed, you must  decide whether o
          not to attempt to repair the catalog. Generally  it is possibl
          to use IDACATFX for this  repair. If  this is to  be attempted
          note the following points:
0         1.  Back up the catalog volume with IEHDASDR before attempting
              the fix, if the master catalog is involved. For complex za
              this may also be a good idea, since a restore may be simpl
              than an un-zap.  It also provides you with a 'checkpoint'
              case the fix appears to work but you find out later that t
              are still problems.
0         2.  After running IDACATFX, re-run the catalog checker to see
              whether the previously detected errors have gone.
0         3.  Try some catalog operations - LOCATE, DEFINE, DELETE, LIST
              These will access the catalog in a different way to the ca
              log checker and will provide further tests.
0         If it is not possible to repair with IDACATFX, catalog recover
          via rebuild will be necessary unless you have a good back up o

          the catalog available. (DASDR dump or REPRO tape). Also, if yo
          catalog is recoverable you may be able to rebuild using RESETC
          and EXPORTRA/IMPORTRA. If  you plan to use REPRO  on a catalog
          be sure to read the  AMS manual very  carefully - not  just th
          'Command Format' section, but  also the  general discussion  o
          catalog REPRO earlier in the manual.

                      two catalog records are printed:
                  1.  The CCR
                  2.  The non-low keyrange record which was retrieved by
                      direct get. The program then goes back to the begi
                      of the low keyrange and attempts to find the 'brea
                      point' between the low and high keyranges. If it i

            Summary - the CCRNFCI field in the CCR, which should point a
                      the last formatted low keyrange record, points aft
                      record which is a low keyrange record but is not t
                      last formatted low keyrange record.
            Meaning - in a correct catalog the formatted low keyrange re
                      are followed by unformatted ones which appear as e
                      CIS (not accessible via keyed processing). Immedia
                      after these in the data component should be the fi

                      A035 is produced. The CCRNFCI value is too low.
            Program action -
                      two catalog records are printed.
                  1.  The CCR
                  2.  The record which should have been a high keyrange
                      ord, but was not.
                      The program then reads forward sequentially and at
                      pts to find the 'break point' between the low and
                      keyranges.  If it is successful, message A060 will

                      proceeding further. The program has succeeded in
                      finding the start of the high keyrange even though
                      the CCRNFCI field is incorrect, by reading the cat
                      log sequentially.  It detects the start of the hig
                      keyrange by a check for a key beginning with x'40'
                      or higher.
0           Program action -
                      these records are printed:
                  1.  The CCR
                  2.  The last low keyrange record (key less than x'40')
                  3.  The first high keyrange record.
                      After printing these records, the program terminat
                      The CCR must be corrected before the program can b
                      rerun. This is because the program relies on a cor
                      CCRNFCI field for validating catalog key values.
          B010
            Summary - a low keyrange record in the 'FREE due to deletion
                      chain is not a FREE record.
            Meaning - the program reads the CCR and uses its CCRFDCI fie
                      to get to the start of the 'FREE due to deletion'
                      chain. While following this chain it found a recor
                      which did not have a ENTYPE field of 'F'.
            Program action -
                      three catalog records are printed:
                  1.  The CCR
                  2.  The FREE record whose forward pointer points to th
                      record in error, if applicable. If the first recor
                      in the chain is in error, zeroes will be printed
                      since there is no FREE record pointing to the one
                      error.
                  3.  The record in error. This is the record which shou
                      have a ENTYPE field of 'F' but does not.
                      After printing the three records, the program cont
                      ues, but no further inspection of FREE records is
                      attempted.  This is because this condition means
                      that the data in the field in the record in error
                      is probably wrong.
                      Note: this message will appear for a catalog with
                      FREE chain (i.e. No defines have been done in a ne
                      catalog, or there are no records left on FREE chai
                      In this case the FREE chain pointer in the CCR is
                      equal to zero and the third CI printed is CI 0.
                      If the record in error has, for example, a ENTYPE
                      of 'D' a later message may show it as a 'dead'
                      record if no other catalog record points to it.
                      If the error has caused a break in the FREE chain
                      some FREE records may also be shown as 'dead'
                      records.
            Some possible causes -
                  1.  A system failure which interrupts a define or
                      delete (or catlg or unctlg, under MVS).

                  2.  Incorrect catalog integrity when the catalog is
                      shared between cpus.
                  3.  A system bug.
            Action  - unless the record in error is at the top of the
                      FREE chain, it should still be possible to define
                      and delete catalog entries.  If the record in
                      error is at the top of the chain, the next define
                      will cause the value of the forward pointer to be
                      put into the CCR, since this is the way catalog
                      managements removes entries from the FREE chain.
                      If this occurs, further defines will not be poss-
                      ible, since the CCR pointer to the start of the
                      FREE chain is incorrect. Deletes are possible, but
                      use of delete merely pushes the error further down
                      the chain - it will cause problems when it reaches
                      the top of the chain again.
                      One possible action is to zap the catalog so that
                      the FREE chain is correct. To do this the user
                      must first decide where the incorrect pointer shou
                      point by following the rest of the FREE chain. For
                      large catalogs this is very tedious and recovering
                      the whole catalog may be faster.
                      If zapping is not practical, recovery of the whole
                      catalog is the only permanent solution. Ater zappi
                      the user should rerun the catalog validity checker
                      ensure that the zap has not created new problems.
            Obtaining further information -
                      these tools may be useful:
                  1.  AMS Print of the low keyrange (TOKEY = x '3F').
                  2.  IEHDASDR or AMSAPZAP print of the low keyrange, us
                      dump to SYSPRINT. These are not as simple to use a
                      AMS but have the advantage of providing dasd addre
                      on the output which are useful for devising zaps.
                  3.  LISTCRA COMPARE (recoverable catalogs only) will
                      indicate whether exportra/importra is a potential
                      recovery technique.
          B015
            Summary - there is a loop in the 'FREE due to deletion' chai
                      in the low keyrange.
            Meaning - the program has read the same record with an ENTYP
                      of 'F' twice while following the FREE chain.
            Program action -
                      three catalog records are printed:
                  1.  The CCR
                  2.  A FREE catalog record which points to the record d
                      ribed below (3).
                  3.  The FREE catalog record which points to a catalog
                      record which has already been read. Note that the
                      record at the top of the loop is not actually read
                      twice - the loop condition is detected without a
                      need to read the record the second time.
                      After printing the three records, the program

                      continues, but no further inspection of FREE recor
                      is attempted.
                      If the loop has caused a break in the FREE chain,
                      FREE records may show up as 'dead' records in late
                      messages.
          C020
            Summary - the ENTYPE field of a low keyrange record pointed
                      directly from the high keyrange was invalid (ie. N
                      one of the following: B, D, V, A, G, or U) or a
                      print of the volume records for volume serial numb
                      passed in the parm field did not result in locatin
                      a volume record in the low key range.
            Meaning - the program reads sequentially through the high ke
                      range. Each high keyrange record contains a CI num
                      which is used to generate a key for a direct get i
                      the low keyrange. The low keyrange record retrieve
                      should be either a GDG base (B), cluster (C), volu
                      (V), non-VSAM (A), alternate index (G), or user ca
                      log record (U). If it is not, message C020 is prod
            Program action -
                      two catalog records are printed:
                  1.  The high keyrange record.
                  2.  The low keyrange record it points to.
                      After this, the program continues with the next hi
                      keyrange record. The low keyrange record will appe
                      in a later message as a 'dead' record unless it is
                      validly pointed to by some other catalog record.
          D010
            Summary - the entname field of a low keyrange GDG base recor
                      does not match the key of the high keyrange record
                      which points to it.
            Meaning - the program reads sequentially through the high ke
                      range. Each high keyrange record contains a CI num
                      which is used to generate a key for a direct get i
                      the low keyrange. For a GDG base record, the high
                      range record's key value should be the GDG name, a
                      the entname field in the low keyrange record shoul
                      also contain this same name.
            Program action -
                      two catalog records are printed:
                  1.  The high keyrange record.
                  2.  The low keyrange record it points to.
                      After this the program continues processing this G
                      base record.
          D045
            Summary - a GDG base record contains a set of fields pointer
                      indicating that a set of fields is in a vertical
                      extension record, but the record referred to does
                      not have an ENTYPE of 'E'.

                      type.
            Program action -
                      two catalog records are printed:
                  1.  The GDG base record.
                  2.  The record which should have been an extension rec

                      The program continues processing with the next set
                      of fields pointer in the same GDG base record.
                      Other messages, or further occurrances of D045, ma
                      occur due to this error condition. Also, the recor
                      which should have been an extension record will sh
                      up as a 'dead' record in other messages, unless so
                      other record points to it correctly.
          D080
            Summary - a GDG base record contains an association pointer
                      which points to a record which is not a non-VSAM
                      record (ENTYPE = 'A').
            Meaning - the program uses the association pointer to do a
                      direct get, expecting to obtain a non-VSAM record
                      (ENTYPE = 'A'). But the record returned was of a
                      different type.
            Program action -
                      two catalog records are printed:
                  1.  The GDG base record.
                  2.  The record which should have been a non-VSAM recor
                      but was not.
                      The program continues processing with the next set

                      correctly.
0         D085
            Summary - a GDG base record contained an association pointer
                      which pointed to a non-VSAM record (ENTYPE='A') an
                      that non-VSAM record has an association pointer in
                      an extension record (ENTYPE='E') but the record re
                      was not an extension record.
0           Meaning - the program uses the association pointer in the no
                      VSAM record to do a direct get expecting to obtain
                      an 'E' record but the record read was of a differe

                     the same GDG base record. Other messages or further
                     occurrances of D085 may occur due to this condition
0         D100
            Summary - the data set name in a non-VSAM record associated
                      with a GDG base record is either a single-level
                      name or is a multiple-level name with a first
                      level which is not the same length as the GDG base
                      name.
            Meaning - the program has found an association pointer in a
                      GDG base record which points to a non-VSAM record.
                      It determines the length of the GDG base name and
                      then tests the first character after the equival-
                      ent length within the non-VSAM name. Since the GDG
                      base name should be equal to the first level of
                      qualification of the non-VSAM name (which should
                      also be multi-level), this character should be a
                      '.'. If it is not, message D100 is produced.
            Program action -
                      three catalog records are printed:
                  1.  The high keyrange record which pointed to the GDG
                      base record.
                  2.  The GDG base record which pointed to the non-VSAM
                      record.
                  3.  The non-VSAM record.
                      The program continues processing the non-VSAM
                      record.
          D105
            Summary - the GDG name in a GDG base record was not equal to
                      the first level of qualification in the entname
                      field of the associated non-VSAM record.
            Meaning - the program has found an association pointer in a
                      GDG base record which points to a non-VSAM record.
                      It has performed the tests associated with message
                      id D100. It then compares the GDG base name with
                      the equivalent characters in the non-VSAM name.
                      An unequal COMPARE results in message D105.
            Program action -
                      three catalog records are printed:
                  1.  The high keyrange record which pointed to the GDG
                      base record.
                  2.  The GDG base record which pointed to the non-VSAM

            Meaning - the program checks for a two-way connection betwee
                      the GDG base record and the associated non-VSAM re
                      cord. If the GDG base's non-VSAM association point
                      points to a non-VSAM record (ENTYPE = 'A') and the
                      first level of qualification of the non-VSAM name
                      is equal to the GDG base name but the non-VSAM
                      record's GDG association pointer does not point to
                      the original GDG base, message D110 is produced.
            Program action -
                      two catalog records are printed:
                  1.  The GDG base record.
                  2.  The non-VSAM record.
                      The program then continues processing the non-VSAM
                      record.
          D115
            Summary - a non-VSAM record (ENTYPE = 'A') pointed to by a n
                      VSAM  association pointer in a GDG base record doe
                      not contain a GDG association pointer.
            Meaning - the program checks all the association sets of fie
                      in the non-VSAM record. If it does not find a GDG
                      association pointer either in the non-VSAM record
                      in an extension record message D115 is issued.
            Program action -
                      three catalog records are printed:
                  1.  The GDG base record.
                  2.  The non-VSAM record.
                      The program then continues processing the GDG base
                      record. No further work is done with the non-VSAM
                      record.
                  3.  The extension record that should have contained th
                      association. (This record is only printed when the
                      pointer indicates it is in an extension record)
          D135
            Summary - a GDG base (ENTYPE = 'B'), extension (ENTYPE = 'E'
                      or non-VSAM (ENTYPE = 'A') record contained a hori
                      zontal extension pointer, but the record pointed t
                      is not an extension record (ENTYPE = 'E').
            Meaning - the program uses the horizontal extension record
                      pointer in the set of field's pointer to do a dire
                      get, expecting to obtain an extension record. But
                      the record returned was of a different type.
            Program action -
                      two catalog records are printed:
                  1.  The record containing the horizontal pointer.
                  2.  The record which should have been an extension rec
                      but was not.
                      The program then continues processing by moving to
                      next high keyrange record. No further processing o

            Summary - the entname field of a low keyrange cluster record
                      does not match the key of the high keyrange record
                      which points to it.
            Meaning - the program reads sequentially through the high ke
                      range. Each high keyrange record contains a CI num
                      which is used to generate a key for a direct get i
                      the low keyrange. For a cluster record, the high k
                      range record key value should be the cluster name,
                      the entname field in the low keyrange record shoul
                      also contain this same name.
            Program action -
                      two catalog records are printed:
                  1.  The high keyrange record.
                  2.  The low keyrange record it points to.
                      After this the program continues processing this
                      cluster record.

                      catalog (ENTYPE ='U') does not contain a user cata
                      log association pointer.
            Meaning - the program checks all the association sets of
                      fields in the alias record. If it does not find a
                      user catalog association pointer, message I120 is
                      produced.
            Program action -
                      two catalog records are printed:
                  1.  The user catalog record.
                  2.  The associated alias record.
                      The program then continues processing the user
                      catalog record. No further work is done with the
                      associated record.
          U035
            Summary - a key value required to read a low keyrange record
                      was found to be invalid.
            Meaning - the program uses CI numbers from catalog record
                      fields in high keyrange or low keyrange records to
                      construct keys for direct gets to the low keyrange
                      This is possible because the control interval numb
                      of a low keyrange record appears in the first four
                      bytes of the key field of a low keyrange record,
                      allowing the program to use a generic get with a k
                      length of 4. Before attempting the get, the progra
                      checks that the last three bytes of the key value
                      (a three-byte CI number right-adjusted in a four-b
                      key field) is greater than or equal to x'000000' a
                      less than the CCRNFCI field in the CCR (which poin
                      to the first unformatted 'never used' record in th
                      low keyrange). If the key is outside this range,
                      message U035 is produced.

            Program action -
                      all five catalog record buffers are printed.
                      Their contents are:
                  1.  The CCR.
                  2.  The high keyrange record currently being processed
                  3.  Any of the following depending on the circumstance
                      GDG base, cluster, volume, non-VSAM, alternate ind
                      user catalog, or a horizontal extension of one of
                      these types. This buffer contains the next level o
                      record down from the high keyrange.
                  4.  Any type of low keyrange record except the CCR. Th
                      buffer contains the next level of record down from
                      (3) above.
                  5.  A vertical extension record of any type of low key
                      range record.
                      The program also prints the following fields using
                      the SNAP macro with an id of '035':
                  1.  The direct RPL used for reading the low keyrange.
                  2.  The sequential RPL used for reading the high key-
                      range.
                  3.  The key value.
                      The program then continues by moving to the next
                      record in the high keyrange. No further work is
                      done on the group of records in error. This error
                      condition could cause other messages to appear or
                      'dead' records to show up, since a record which wa
                      pointed to from a high or low keyrange record
                      could not be obtained.

            Summary - this is not an error located by the catalog checke
                      It is a volume extension record (W) printed as par
                      of a request to list the volume structure in the
                      parm field of the EXEC statement. This record is a
                      record in the horizontal chain of 'W' records.
          W150
            Summary - this is not an error located by the catalog checke
                      It is a volume extension record (w) printed as par

                      record in the vertical chain of 'W' records.
          X040
            Summary - a low keyrange record is not pointed to correctly
                      by any other catalog record.
            Meaning - this condition can be normal after the catalog mgm
                      Levelset ptf's have been applied. If the record th
                      is 'dead' is a FREE CI it may have been caused by
                      additional validity checking added with the levels
                      code. When the 'dead record' is a FREE CI it can b

                      re-claimed by rebuilding the freechain.
                      The program creates a table with an entry for each
                      low keyrange formatted record by using the value
                      in the CCRNFCI field in the CCR to determine the
                      number of entries. As a low keyrange record is rea
                      successfully via a key based on a CI number obtain
                      ed from a high keyrange record or another low key-
                      range record, the appropriate entry in the table i
                      marked. When all high keyrange records have been
                      read, the program goes through the table and any
                      entries which are still unmarked are indicated
                      as 'dead' records.
                      Note that certain error conditions may cause an
                      entry to remain unmarked in the table even though
                      its record has been retrieved. For example, if a
                      high keyrange record points to a low keyrange re-
                      cord which can be read successfully, but the low
                      keyrange record is not an expected type (data,
                      index, non-VSAM, GDG base, cluster, or user cata-
                      log). The rule is that a record is not 'dead' as
                      long as it is pointed to by another catalog rec-
                      ord and is a correct record type for that pointer
                      connection. So if a record is the expected type,
                      if will not be 'dead' even if it contains incor-
                      rect fields.
            Program action -
                      the program prints message X040 and the 'dead'
                      record once for each 'dead' record. When all 'dead
                      records have been processed, the program prints
                      the statistics page and terminates.

         MAP012E attempt to open VTOC failed
0           This  appears  when  the dcboflgs bit in the DCB for the VTO
            not  set  by  open.  This should never occur as IEHMAP has d
            tiot  search  for  the ddcard allocating the volume to itsel
            this does occur, it is probably an error in open.
0        MAP013E first DSCB not f4
0           This  appears  when  the  first  DSCB read from the VTOC is
            format 4. This indicates the volume is not useable by VS.
0        MAP014E bad DSCB; should have been f5

            This  appears when a dataset NAME is too fully qualified; ie
            DSNAME is really shorter than given. (Locate return code 16)
0        MAP021E syntax error in dataset NAME
0           This  appears  when  some  syntax  error  was found by the l
            routines  in  the DSNAME. This could be a 9 character index,
            IEHMAP  does  not  validity  check dataset names passed to i
            control  cards  other  than  for  those  on a CATLG control
            (Locate return code 20)

            the VTOC. (Obtain return code 12)
0        MAP027E invalid workarea ->
0           This appears when the obtain routines determine that the wor
            pointer  passed  by IEHMAP is not valid. As IEHMAP does a ge
            for  its  workarea,  the occurance of this message is an err
            getmain. (Obtain return code 16)
0        MAP028E CCHHR not in VTOC
0           This  appears when a DSCB has a pointer to a chained DSCB an

            This  appears  when an end of file condition was encountered
            reading  the  first  DSCB from the VTOC. This means the volu
            not useable by VS.
0        MAP030E eof reading 1st f5
0           This  appears  when an end of file condition was encountered
            the  second  DSCB  of  the VTOC was being read, this is the
            format  5  in the VTOC. This means that the volume is not us
            by VS.
0        MAP031E f6 does not -> at f6
0           This  appears  when  a  format  6 indicates that there is an
            format  6  chained  from  it,  but  the DSCB pointed to was
            format  6.  This is accompanied by a DUMP of the format 6 an
            DSCB that it was pointing to.
-        MAP032W *** no more core, aborted ***
0           This  appears  when  IEHMAP  could  not get enough core to d
            requested  operation  in.  IEHMAP  will  attempt  to give as
            useful  information  as it can from what it has been able to
            into core with the core available.
0        MAP033E f3 does not -> at f3
0           This  appears  when  a  format  3 indicates that there is an
            format  3 chained from it, but that DSCB was not a format 3.
            is  accompanied  by  a DUMP of the format 3 and the DSCB tha
            chained from it.
0           This  will  probably  never  appear,  as  at present, VS doe
            support more than one format 3 to a dataset.
0        MAP034E error re-writing f5
0           This  appears when IEHMAP had an I/o error attempting to re-
            the format 5 chain during a FIXUP or SORT operation.
0        MAP035W permanent I/O error in directory
0           This appears when an I/o error occured while IEHMAP was read
            po  dataset's  directory.  This probably means that the dire
            has been overwritten.
0        MAP036I dddd TRACKS replaced

            any one FIXUP or SORT operation.
-        MAP038W VTOC contaminated, warning
0           This  appears  when the bos/dos bit is set in the format 4 o
            VTOC.  This means that the information obtained from the for
            chain may be erroneous (neither bos nor dos maintain the for
            chain).
0        MAP039E f5 does not -> at f5
0           This  appears  when  a  format 5 indicated that there was an
            format  5  chained from it, but the DSCB was not a format 5.
            is  accompainied  by a DUMP of the format 5 and the DSCB tha
            chained from it.

-     2.42.1   FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
+     2.42.1   FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
+              __________ ________
-     To aid in the installation of MVS/SP System IPO, program IPOUPDTE
      provided.  IPOUPDTE is a batch JCL tailoring procedure and is desi
      to change selected fields in the JCL and control statements distri
      with MVS/SP System IPO.  IPOUPDTE resides in IPO1.LINKLIB as a loa
      module.  Control statements can be entered either through SYSIN or
      through the operator's console.  IPOUPDTE executes as a batch job
      DD statements defining the libraries to be updated and  control
      statements defining the modifications to be made to these librarie
      The libraries are updated inplace.
0     Note: Only libraries with member $$$COIBM are eligible for
      updating by IPOUPDTE.  This member need have nothing in it.
0     A line of data to be updated within eligible libraries is defined
      input line.  Changes to the input lines are defined by specifying
      string of characters, called STRING1, with which to scan the input
      and, if found within the input line, to be replaced by another str
      characters, called STRING2.
0     1.  The string to be replaced, STRING1, must be totally contained
          columns 1 through 71, inclusive.  Thus, the continuation colum
          column 72, and the sequence number fields, columns 73 through
          are not affected by any updates.
0     2.  When the equivalent of STRING1 is encountered in the input lin
          that set of equivalent characters must also be properly delimi
          the left and on the right within the input line.  If STRING1 i
          found in the first position of the input line, it is considere
          delimited on the left.  Likewise, if STRING1 is found at the e
          the input line (ending in position 71), it is considered as
          delimited on the right.  Elsewhere in the input line, one of t
          following characters must be to the left and to the right:
            ' , . / < > ? " : ; ^ + _ ( ) * %  =
            and blank
          Also, '.V' is considered as a special two character delimiter.
0     3.  When STRING2 is longer then STRING1, blanks are deleted from p
          of two or more blanks following STRING1 within the line, up to
          including column 71.  Thus for a field containing just one bla
          that blank would not be deleted.  If there is no place to dele
          blanks, an error message is issued, the line is not updated, a
          processing continues with the next line.

      4.  When the length of STRING2 is less than that of STRING1, blank
          inserted after the next pool of two blanks following STRING1.
0     5.  Updates to a line occur in the order that the control statemen
          were entered.  Each control statement processes the line in it
          entirety, before the next control statement processes the line

+     2.42.2   JCL FOR IPOUPDTE
+              ___ ___ ________
-     Below is a list of the JCL requirements necessary to execute IPOUP
      a batch job.
0     1.  Execute PGM=IPOUPDTE.  If IPO1.LINKLIB is not in the LNKLST of
          system on which the job is to be run (it is in the LNKLST on t
          distributed MVS/SP System IPO), then the job should include a
          to IPO1.LINKLIB or the step should include a STEPLIB to IPO1.L
          or IPOUPDTE should be copied from IPO1.LINKLIB to a load modul
          library that is in the LNKLST of the system on which the job i
          be run.
0     2.  The PARM field of the EXEC statement can specify PARM=CHECK,
          PARM=UPDATE, PARM=INSTALL, or no parameter field, in which cas
          PARM=CHECK is defaulted.  PARM=UPDATE or PARM=INSTALL is requi
          cause the actual update to be done.  PARM=CHECK, the default,
          everything that PARM=UPDATE does except it does not write the
          updated record back to the data set.  This can be used for
          verification before the updates are done without affecting the
          status of the data sets.
          PARM=INSTALL is used during system load down and requires spec
          DDnames in the job.  The control statements are generated from
          special DDnames.
          An invalid parameter field produces an error message, and proc
          terminates.
0     3.  A SYSPRINT DD statement is required.  The SYSPRINT file is use
          log all input control statements, output messages, and updates
          DCB attributes are RECFM=FBA,LRECL=121.  The default blocksize
          121.  If the SYSPRINT DD statement is missing, an error messag
          issued to the console and processing terminates.
0     4.  All libraries to be considered for update must be defined in t
          by DD statements, each of whose DDNAME must be unique and the
          character of which must be a commercial (@).  For example:
            //@JCLLIB DD DSN=IPO1.JCLLIB,DISP=SHR
          A library to be updated must be a partitioned data set (DSORG=
          RECFM=F or FB, LRECL=80, and it must be allocated on a direct
          volume.  If a data set fails to meet these requirements a warn
          message is issued and processing continues with the next libra
0           Page 177    Operating System and Technology Utilities Manual

-
          For partitioned data sets, if no member is specified for the d
          set on the DD statement, then all members of the library are
          processed by IPOUPDTE.  Multiple libraries are allowed in one
          execution by specifying additional DD statements to define the

0     5.  Control statements for IPOUPDTE can be entered through file na
          SYSIN, whose DCB attributes are RECFM=F or FB and LRECL=80.  I
          SYSIN DD statement is not present and PARM=INSTALL is not spec
          then the operator is prompted for input through the operator's
          console via a WTOR sequence.  The SYSIN DD statement is not us
          when PARM=INSTALL is specified.
0     6.  When PARM=INSTALL is specified, special DD statements whose DD
          begin with the letter "Z" are required.  The DDname of the for
          "Zvvvvvv" is specified where "vvvvvv" is the volume serial of
          device to be changed.
          For example:
            //ZIPORES DD UNIT=3350,VOL=SER=MVSRES,DISP=OLD
          will generate the following IPOUPDTE control statements:
            IPORES<MVSRES<<               CHANGE VOLUME SERIAL
            3330-1<3350<IPORES<           CHANGE DEVICE TYPE
          using the information contained in the DD statement.  These tw
          control statements are generated for each special "Z" DD state
          present in the step.

0     There are four types of control statements associated with IPOUPDT
      basic control statement, the extended control statement,  the END
      ment, and the comment statement.  The syntax of the basic control
      ment is a follows:
0       STRING1<STRING2<   optional comments
0     where STRING1 and  STRING2 are as previously defined.    The 'less
      symbol (<) is used to delineate the strings.   The basic form caus
      delineated occurrences  of STRING1 on all  lines of the libraries
      replaced by STRING2.  An example follows:
0       UNIT=3330-1,VOL=SER=IPOLIB  /*LIB*/     input line1 before updat
        UNIT=3330-1,VOL=SER=IPORES  /*RES*/     input line2 before updat
0       3330-1<3350<                            first control statement
        IPOLIB<IPORES<                          second control statement

        UNIT=3350,VOL=SER=IPORES    /*LIB*/     resultant line1 after up
        UNIT=3350,VOL=SER=IPORES    /*RES*/     resultant line2 after up
0     The syntax of the extended form is as follows:
        STRING1<STRING2<STRING3<   optional comments where STRING1 and S
      are as previously defined and STRING3 is  used to limit the set of
      to be updated.  STRING3 must appear on the
0     original line,  as it was before any updates,  before STRING1 can
      placed by  STRING2.   All  80 columns are  searched for  STRING3.
      STRING3 is used in the members of the install process jobs, it is
      with the characters /* - */.
0     An example follows:
0       UNIT=3330-1,VOL=SER=IPOLIB  /*LIB*/     input line1 before updat
        UNIT=3330-1,VOL=SER=IPORES  /*RES*/     input line2 before updat
0       3330-1<3350</*RES*/<                    first control statement
        IPORES<SYSRES</*RES*/<                  second control statement
0       UNIT=3330-1,VOL=SER=IPOLIB  /*LIB*/     resultant line1 after up
        UNIT=3350,VOL=SER=SYSRES    /*RES*/     resultant line2 after up
0     The END control statement causes the termination of further input
      control statements.    The syntax of the  END statement is END  co
      columns 1  through 3  and a blank  in column 4.    The remainder
      statement is not used and can contain comments.  This functions th
      as a normal end-of-file on SYSIN.
0     A comment statement consists of a </*  in columns 1 through 3.   C
      statements cannot be continued,  a new comment statement should be
      Only the first 72 columns of the control statement are used,  colu
      through 80 are ignored.  STRING1 begins in column 1.  The maximum
      for STRING1, STRING2,  or STRING3 is 70 characters.   The minimum
      for STRING1 is 1.   The minimum length  for STRING2 and STRING3 is
      If STRING2 is null, a length of zero,  STRING1 is deleted from the
      If STRING3 is null, the extended form reverts to the basic form.
0     A control statement can only be continued after a "less than" symb
      by placing a  dash (-)  or a  plus (+)  immediately following  the
      than" symbol.    The remainder of the  statement is not scanned  a
      contain comments.   When using a dash (-)  to continue a statement
      control statement scan resumes in column 1 of the next statement.
      using a plus (+) to continue a statement, the control statement sc
      sumes at the first non-blank character of the next statement.   Th
      tinuation character, dash or plus, is not considered as part of th
      trol statement.
0     Comments can be  placed after the first blank following  the third
      than' symbol (<)  of the control statement or following the contin
      character of a continued statement.

      For input from the console,  a WTOR sequence is used.   Up to 72 c
      ters may be entered in a single  reply,  or continuations may be u
      placing a dash (-)  as the last character of the response.   For c
      input only, if an invalid control statement is encountered, a mess
      written to the operator,  the statement is  ignored,  and a prompt
      new control statement is issued.   When  in console input mode,  c
      messages are logged to the operator's console as well as to SYSPRI
0     Some examples of the syntax of IPOUPDTE control statements:
        3330-1<3350<UNIT=< A COMMENT AFTER THE  BLANK The above control
      ment would change  all delineated occurrences of the  string '3330
      '3350' on every line that contained  the string 'UNIT=' of every l
      specified.

      plus signs  used for  continuations and  the fact  that comments
      placed after the continuation character.

+     2.42.4   NO UPDATE AND RESUME UPDATE FACILITY
+              __ ______ ___ ______ ______ ________
-     There is a NO UPDATE and a RESUME UPDATE facility.   For certain m
      of partitioned data sets,  it may be  inappropriate for them to be
      essed by IPOUPDTE in a massive update.  By coding a .NU.  (No Upda
      the first line of the member not  to be considered for update,  up
      is suspended until end-of-file is reached for the member or until
      (Resume Update)  is encountered,  in which  case updating resumes
      next line of the member.   This facility can be overridden by spec
      the member name in the data set in the DD statement.   For example
      sume the following lines  existed in a member of a  partitioned da
      being processed by IPOUPDTE:  //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=A //SYSIN    DD
       RENAME DSNAME=IPO1.LINKLIB,       .NU..RU.
              VOL=3330-1=IPORES,NEWNAME=IPO1.LINKLIB
       ...  etc.   And, had one of the control statements for IPOUPDTE b
      follows:
        IPO1<MSPIPO< then,  the IPO1 on the line containing the .NU.  an
      would not  be changed,   but the  IPO1 on  the following  line wou
      changed.  The resulting lines would be as follows:
0     //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=A //SYSIN    DD *
       RENAME DSNAME=IPO1.LINKLIB,       .NU..RU.
              VOL=3330-1=IPORES,NEWNAME=MSPIPO.LINKLIB
       ...  etc.   Had the above JCL existed  in a data set whose DD sta
      specifically referenced only  the one member,  then  the resulting
      would be as follows:  //SYSPRINT DD SYSOUT=A //SYSIN    DD *
       RENAME DSNAME=MSPIPO.LINKLIB,       .NU..RU.

0     The JES3 activity reporting system is a combination of 2 programs.
      first, J3ACTSMF, is the data extractor and J3ACTRPT is the report
      ator.  Note that J3ACTSMF is also capable of generating a report.

0     This program reads the SMF dump tapes  and processes the 6 (output
      (purge) and 57 (NJE)  records.   The output is a summary record wh
      added to the J3ACT history file  and optionally 4 reports,  identi
      those generated by J3ACTRPT, for the time period of the SMF record
0     The JCL to execute J3ACTSMF is:
0               //step   EXEC PGM=J3ACTSMF,PARM=center-id
                //SYSPRINT  DD SYSOUT=A  or  DUMMY

0     Function/Operation -- 'LISTPDS' is an OS/360 partitioned data set
               utility program for listing and/or punching source
               libraries.  It generates formatted listings of the PDS's
               directory, the contents of processed members, as well as
               (optionally) punching the contents of processed members.
               The primary purpose of 'LISTPDS' is for processing standa
               80-byte per logical record source and macro libraries.
               Special functions and formatting handles the processing o
               RITS/CRBE format (88-byte) libraries.  In addition, 'LIST
               will handle libraries with RECFM=U, V, or VB although
               processing of such libraries is not its primary purpose.
               The major design criteria for 'LISTPDS' was efficient, hi
               performance (high speed) operation.

                         punched per source record (depending on the len
                         of the source record).  For RITS/CRBE files, th
                         last 80 bytes of a source record is punched. (T
                         last 80 bytes in a RITS/CRBE/crje library sourc
                         record is the standard card image.)

-     Symbolic parameters and the standard run defaults --
               the standard run parameters for the 'LISTPDS' program
               are specified through symbolic parameters which are
               specified at assembly time.  The standard set of
               defaults for LISTPDS are --
                         LIST, NODECK, NOT 'LIST DIR ONLY', NOUPDTE,
                         NO RITS/CRBE, XLATE, SSI, TRUNC, NOHEXOUT,
                         TEXT, EROPT=TERM, LINECNT=58
               These defaults can be modified by changing the symbolic
               parameter set statements in the LISTPDS source deck.
-     LISTPDS program design --
               LISTPDS is designed as a serially reusable, block loaded,
               single load module, non overlay utility program with
               optimization for high performance (efficient) I/O
               operations.  Except for the use of the edit (ed) instruct
               LISTPDS is coded entirely with standard instruction set (
               instructions.  It does use the extended mnemonics for reg
               branches and requires use of assembler(g) (or ibm's assem
               (h)).  The QSAM locate mode access method is used for all
               I/O operations except those dealing with SYSLIB.  For SYS
               I/O operations, the BSAM/BPAM access method is used for b
               directory reading as well as PDS member reading.  LISTPDS
               does not use the BLDL/FIND system function for reading
               the directory but instead performs its own directory read
               using BSAM/BPAM.  A table is constructed (in core) for th
               directory of the PDS currently being processed.
0              LISTPDS was developed under release 18.6 Of OS/360 and ha
               been tested under release 18.6 And 20.6 As implemented
               on the ibm 360/91 located 91 located at the NASA Goddard
               Center.
-     LISTPDS diagnostic messages --
0     *Note*   all diagnostic messages are outputted to the SYSPRINT fil
               except the 'SYSPRINT open error' message which is outputt
               to the operator/programmer via a wto.  Under release 19+,
               this wto will cause a 'write to programmer' message to be
               issued.

           1.0  General Description
0          This subroutine is used to return dsnames and the volser
           for a specified INDEX structure.  The INDEX structure can be
           specified as several high-level qualifiers or it can be a
           dsname containing one embedded asterisk not as the high-level
           qualifier.
-
-          2.0  Parameter list and return code description
0          The parameter list is a four or five word list containing the
           following:
0           Word         description
0             1          Address of the 44-byte field containing the
                         INDEX structure.
              2          Address of the 44-byte field into which
                         LOCINDEX will place the dsname.
              3          Address of the 6-byte field into which
                         LOCINDEX will place the volser of the dataset.
              4          Address of a 4k work area to be used by
                         LOCINDEX for storing catalog blocks.
              5          Optional field for the address of a fullword
                         of storage on an integral boundary into which
                         LOCINDEX will store the return code.
0          The high order bit of the last word of the parameter list
           must be set on.
0           Return code  meaning
0                0       A dsname was found and the dataset resides on
                         a disk volume.
                 4       The INDEX structure was not found.
                 8       A dsname was found and the dataset resides on
                         a tape volume.
                12       A dsname was found but it resides on multiple

                24       Error was detected in SVC26 whose cause could
                         not be determined. Notify systems programmer.
-              Some Cautions on using this subroutine:
0                    1) The part above the asterisk is passed to VSAM
                        generic locate and works however generic locate
                        locate works. Only non-VSAM datasets are passed
                        back to the caller.
                     2) The characters below the asterisk must appear
                        in the dataset name anywhere after the search
                        key characters. They may contain leading
                        and trailing partial INDEX levels.
                     3) The amount of storage required for a VSAM generi
                        locate is much more than the 4k area provided by
                        the os caller. A 64k area is getmained and its
                        address is stored in the first work of the 4k
                        caller work area. It is freemained when the
                        return code of 16 signals the end of datasets
                        under this INDEX.
                     5) The 265 byte camlist work area is put in the
                        caller provided work area at offset 4. This
                        allows access to the complete volume list.

                   To help identify the date of a log data set, LOGSCAN
                   recognizes the date from message IEE102I as it appear
                   in the log from a JES3/MVS system.  A record is print
                   the first time this message is found and each time th
                   date changes.  To utilize this feature on other types
                   systems, add a message that will be issued periodical
                   in this format -
                                             IEE102I hh.mm.ss yy.ddd
                   where the message id begins in the 40th position,
                   or zap location x'22' to the position of 'IEE102I'
                   in your log (relative to 1). This is a halfword value
                   in hexadecimal. -  VER 0022 0028
                   (for an unmodified JES2 system this would be the 25th
                   position, or x'19'. - REP 0022 0019)
                   if your log has its timestamps in a position other th
                   those mentioned on page 4, you may zap the halfword
                   value of its position (relative to 1) into
                   location x'24'. -  VER 0024 0001

                   and variable blocked data with LRECL not larger than
                   133, or undefined records with BLKSIZE not larger
                   than 133.  As a convenience, LOGSCAN will accept
                   records up to 255 bytes long, but only the first
                   133 bytes can be scanned, printed or punched.
                   LOGSCAN strips the first byte from input records
                   if print control characters are indicated
                   in the JCL or the data set label.  The record

+              ___________ ______________
0                  LOGSCAN may be executed on OS/360 or OS/VS systems.
                   The amount of CPU time used varies greatly, depending
                   the size of the data set being processed, the number
                   data type control statements, the range of time
                   specified, and use of the margin control card.  If th
                   position of a desired message is known, a margin card
                   can be used to compare that one position instead of
                   comparing 133 positions.  This also can prevent unwan
                   records from being printed.  If several data type car
                   are being used with a large data set, judicious use o
                   the time card can reduce the run time considerably.

                   the location of the timestamps and the location of
                   message IEE102I within the log records, as well as to
                   indicate a TSO session.
              T=ppp   (where ppp is the position of the first character
                   the timestamp) can be used when the timestamp is 6 to
                   digits long, but does not appear in position 1.
              I=ppp   (where ppp is the position where message IEE102I w

                   but does not start in position 40.
                   For example, the following statement -

      2.51.7   Control Cards
+     2.51.7   Control Cards
+              _______ _____
0                  All control cards are optional except that at least
                   a time card or sequence card or one or more data type
                   cards is required.  Statements may begin in any colum
              TIME=hhmm,hhmm
                   Specifies the beginning and end of the desired period
                   If used with data type cards, only records within thi
                   time will be scanned for the specified data.
                   The last time card read is effective for the entire s
                   HHMM must be four digits, with leading zeros if neede
                   If the beginning time is greater than the ending time
                   it is assumed that a time period spanning midnight
                   is desired.  The program processes records up to the
                   end of the data set, so records from more than one
                   day may be produced.  LOGSCAN recognizes time stamps
                   of 6 to 8 digits starting in position 1 or 2 of
                   each record or in the format hh.mm.ss starting in
                   position 6.  Records without time stamps are handled
                   according to the most recent time-stamped record.
              MARGIN=sss,eee
                   Sets limits of the scan, if desired.  Default is 1,13
                   This sets the range of positions the first character
                   of data must be found in.  As many margin cards as
                   desired can be used.  Each one is effective for all
                   data type cards following it until reset by another
                   margin card.  Sss and eee can be one to three digits
                   with values between 1 and 133.  If eee is omitted, it
                   assumed to be the same as sss, I.E. Only one position
                   A forms ruler may be used with a sample of a data set
                   for exact margin determination, since control charact
                   and record descriptor words are removed before
                   processing, and only data is scanned.
              DATA='--character string--',WORD

                   Used to select or exclude records with certain data.
                   The WORD parameter, if used, requires the matching da
                   to be surrounded by blanks or punctuation. This is us
                   when using a short search argument such as a job numb
                   or device number which could also appear as part of a
                   unrelated name, to reduce unwanted output.  Character
                   other than letters, numbers, and national characters
                   considered to be punctuation.  The ABBR parameter
                   requires the matching data to be preceded by a blank
                   or punctuation.  This would be desired, for example,
                   when searching for a certain message prefix.  If neit
                   parameter is specified, matching data will be selecte
                   even if it is embedded in a longer name.
                   Any character can be used in lieu of the apostrophes,

                   NOT= causes a record with that data to be omitted.
                   AND= requires a record to match the data from this ca
                   as well as previous card(s).  Any number of data type
                   cards may be used.  If AND= or NOT= cards are used in
                   an argument, they must follow all OR= and DATA= cards
                   in that argument.  DATA= can be use interchangeably

                   A card beginning with an asterisk can contain comment
                   Comments may also appear in any control card if they
                   separated from the operands by one or more blanks.
              GO
                   When entering control statements from a TSO terminal,
                   go may be used instead of /* when all statements have
                   been entered.  This keeps the SYSIN data set open and
                   allows the program to request omitted control stateme
              NOPRINT
                   If this statement is used, selected records will not
                   appear in the print data set.  It could be used when

                   The save control statement is a variation of the card
                   beginning with a slash. It defines the end of an argu
                   and also indicates that any record selected using tha
                   argument is not to be printed until a record is selec
                   under another argument ending with a slash.  The save
                   record will be printed before the new record.  The sa
                   record will not be printed again, but other records f
                   under that search argument will be saved and processe
                   in the same way.  Only the last saved record will be
                   printed before the record from another argument.
                   The SAVE2 statement provides the ability to save anot
                   type of record without affecting the record saved usi
                   the SAVE statement.  If records have been saved for
                   both arguments, the SAVE2 record will always be print
                   after the SAVE record, regardless of the order of the
                   occurence in the original data set.
                   The PRINT control statement causes records selected
                   under that argument to be printed without affecting
                   any record which has been saved.  Note that use of th
                   statement may cause records to be printed in a differ
                   order than the original, because a record may have be
                   saved before which will not be printed until a record
                   is selected using an argument which ends with a slash
                   card.
                   The NEXT statement causes a record to be printed only
                   if it is the first one after a record selected
                   using an argument which ends with a slash card.
                   The SKIP statement causes records to be ignored.  Thi

                   can be used to thin out records and reduce the need f
                   many NOT= statements in subsequent arguments.
                   A SLASH control statement is assumed for the last
                   argument in the control data set unless a SAVE or SAV
                   or PRINT or NEXT or SKIP statement is used.  Records
                   processed according to the first argument which they
                   match.  If a record would be selected under more than
                   argument and it is desired that it always be printed,
                   save and next arguments should be coded last.
                   Since the statements in the following group are mutua
                   exclusive in the same argument, only the last one cod
                   will be honored if they appear consecutively:

0                  The use of symbolic variables in a canned routine
                   allows frequently used routines to be easily modified
                   The symbolic variables in the procedure are defined a
                   one- to eight-character names preceded by an ampersan
                   The first character must be alphabetic, and the follo
                   characters may be alphanumeric.  If the field followi
                   the symbol is alphanumeric, the symbol must be termin
                   with a period.  If a period is desired following the
                   symbol, two periods must be coded.  Default values fo
                   the symbols can be established by providing set
                   statements in the procedure.  Only the first definiti
                   of a symbolic value is effective, so the default valu
                   coded in the procedure will be ignored if a set state
                   is provided by the user.  The SET statement must appe
                   before the statement(s) where the value is to be chan
                   The format of the SET statement is:
                        SET ssssssss=vvvvvvvvvvvv
                   where ssssssss is the symbolic name without the amper
                   and vvvvvvvvvvvv is the variable data to replace it.
                   The variable data may not contain blanks, although
                        SET ssssssss=
                   may be used to nullify the symbol.

       field on the EXEC statement.  Available options are:
0                LIST, XREF, MACRO, INDEX
                 NOLIST,NOXREF,NOMACRO,NOINDEX
0      The default set is PARM =(LIST,XREF,NOMACRO,NOINDEX)
0      LIST     gives a numbered listing of all statements in a member.
       continuation is recognized by a nonblank character in column 72.
0      XREF     gives a cross reference listing of symbolic parameters a
        sequence symbols (as in macros or cataloged procedures).  NOXREF
        forced on a member basis if no symbolic parameters and sequence
        symbols are found.  Symbololic parameters and sequence symbols a
        recognized by a blind scan of the source text, so it is possible
        invalid symbols may ocasionally be found.
0      MACRO  causes the LIST and XREF options to be suppressed except f
         source code delimited by MACRO and MEND statements.  This may b
         useful when listing source code containingg programmer macros,
         mixed library containing both macros and other forms of code.
0      INDEX gives a cross reference index of symbolic parameter versus
         name.  The index is derived from a condensation of the XREF
         information, but may be obtaiined even if NOXREF is in effect (
         implies NOXREF).  This option will be of value prrimarily for m
         libraries relying heavily on the use of global symbols or a com
         naming system.  Note again that the scan is blind so that, for
         example, COPY statements are not processed, and all symbols are
         therefore actually mentioned in the member.
0      The following DD statements are required:
0      SYSLIB defines the partitioned data set to be processed.  If a me
         name is specified as part of the DSNAME, only that member will
         processed.  Multiple complete PDS's, but not individual members
         be concatenated.

0              Alias should be loaded after loading the true name via

               used by the alias entry(s) will be freed when necessary.
               If you forget to load the true name, the only damage is
               that the memory used cannot be freed via "de" or "delete"
               nevertheless, "de" or "delete" will cause the cessation
               of use of all aliases. be Aware that it is only necessary
               to load a single true name and a single alias for the
               routine entry point that you want to test; it is not
               necessary to load every single alias for a module for
               MODREP testing purposes. Also, be aware that an alias
               only costs 48 bytes for the CDE/XTLST, and no memory for
               for the module, and the entire module is loaded under the
               true name.

                                memory is freed. The net result is that

                                that was placed in the system with a pri
                                invokation of MODREP. This consideration
                                is only important in the fact that a
                                subsequent use of this module will
                                successfully do what you want, but the
                                previous invokation's memory for the
                                CDE/XTLST and module (nxa,lxa) are fixed
                                and thus become wasted "real frames" of
                                memory. Also a consideration for SVC's
                                is that MODREP can only place the SVCTAB

+            ______
0        This program  accepts system or JES2  operator commands as  inp
      executes them using SVC 34. It must be APF authorized.
0        MVSCMD can operate in one of three modes:
-        1.  Batch or CALLed program
             In this mode  MVSCMD accepts input as either  80-byte card
             ages from SYSIN or a single  command from the PARM field.
             response to the  operator command will appear  on all opera
             consoles. For example:
0            //STEP1    EXEC PGM=MVSCMD,PARM='VARY 017,ONLINE'
0                      - or -
0            //STEP1    EXEC PGM=MVSCMD //SYSIN    DD * VARY 017,ONLINE
-        2.  TSO Command Processor
             In this mode  MVSCMD expects to find the  operator command
             rectly following  on the TSO input  line.  The response  to
             commands will then be displayed on the TSO terminal.  Respo
             to JES2 commands will appear on all consoles.  For example:
0                      MVSCMD D T          <--- (Response will appear on
-        3.  Callable subroutine
             In this  mode MVSCMD  accepts input  according to  standard
             linkage conventions. In addition to the command itself, a s
             ond parameter may be passed  which contains the console num
             where you wish the response to appear.   (The SVC 34 will a
             assume the authority of that console.) For example:
0                      LA        R1,CMDADDR   LA        R15,=V(MVSCMD)
                       R14,R15

      $INDEX lists all  the OMEGAMON screens that are  available in alph
      order.  $INDEX2 lists the OMEGAMON screens by function.   When you
      OMEGAMON you must first hit enter to go to the default screen.  Th
      can go to any  other screen by typing in the screen's  name in the
      left hand corner where the '_______________' begins.  When you hit
      without a name you get your present  screen updated to reflect wha

               specified. The program will compare directory entries
               only, it will compare 80 byte members by columns 1-72
               or by the sequence field (73-80) or it will compare
               SMP rel 4 CDS SYSMOD entries. Any descripenties will be
               listed on the SYSPRINT data set.

0              Parm options:
               directory - compare PDS directory entries only
               members   - compare each members records by all 80 bytes
               seqfield  - compare each members records by the sequence
                           field (73-80)
               SYSMOD    - compare the SYSMOD entries
               linecount - number of lines per page value from 01 to 99
                           default is 58
0              Limit     - option when used with the 'members' or
                           'seqfield' options,. This option limits
                           the number of mismatches printed out

      2.66   PDSGAS
+     2.66   PDSGAS
+            ______
0        Description:   This program reads a PDS and finds "gas" members
      members that have been deleted but have not been compressed out ye
0      DDNAMEs required:
         SYSLIB    -  input PDS
         SYSPRINT  -  output messages
0      If PARM=ADD is specified, the program will add a member
       name to the directory for each "gas" member.
0      The added member names all begin with '$GAS', followed
       by a 4 digit sequence number.
0      If PARM=TTR(tt.tt.rr) is specified, the program will add
       a member name to the directory for the "gas" member
       having the specified TTR location (in hex, obtained from
       a previous run). This is useful if PARM=ADD causes the
       directory to fill up, or if you know which one you want.
0      For very large PDS's you may want to specify PARM=ADD
       the first time, because this program reads every block
       in the PDS.  It may be quicker to delete all the
       generated member names than to run it a second time.
0      Any user data that was in the directory entry of
       a deleted or replaced member cannot be recovered.
0      A note about load modules.  This program cannot recover
       a "gas" load module.  It will give it a member name so
       it wont be compressed out, but the directory entry will
       not be a load module type.  To reconstruct the proper
       load module directory would require information that
       is no longer in the PDS.

      2.67   PDSLOAD
+     2.67   PDSLOAD
+            _______
-     This program converts a sequential data set of PDS members in 'IEB
      format to a partitioned data set.
0     The IEBUPDTE utility program can do the same thing, but this progr
      the following added capabilities:
         Stores SPF statistics in a member's directory entry
         if they are present on the './ ADD' statement,
         Can generate SPF statistics if none are present,
         Can select one member from input file,
         Restores modified IEBUPDTE statements within a member
         (changes '/.' Back to './').
         Does not list the data in the member,
         Prints number of records for each member written.
0     If PARM='UPDTE(xx)' is specified,  then all occurrences of the 2 c
      ters in parentheses will be changed to  './' Before being written
      PDS, if they occur in columns 1-2 of the data.  This is used in co
      tion with another program which creates IEBUPDTE-format data sets
      PDS,  and in so doing changes all  occurrences of './' In columns
      the data within  the members to another constant,  so  IEBUPDTE an
      program will  not treat  the data records  as control  cards.   IE
      doesn't change the data back. This program does.
0     The only IEBUPDTE control statements that  are acceptable are the
      statement and the ./ ALIAS statement.  The 'NAME=' operand must be
      ified  as the  first  or second  operand  (sometimes  SSI= is  spe
      first).   Any other IEBUPDTE operand (except  SSI=)  is invalid an
      prevent subsequent operands from being processed.
0     These ADD statements will be processed correctly -
        ./ ADD NAME=XYZ
        ./ ADD NAME=XYZ,SSI=0012C06A
        ./ ADD SSI=1234ABCD,NAME=XYZ
0     In order for SPF  statistics to be stored,  the './  ADD' statemen
      look like this:
0        Col     description
         1-20    ./ ADD NAME=xxxxxxxx
         21      blank
         22-71   vvmm-yyddd-yyddd-hhmm-nnnnn-nnnnn-nnnnn-uuuuuuuuuu
                 VER CREATE LASTMODIFY  SIZE  INIT   MOD   ID
0     The 'LISTPDS' utility program (from nasa goddard) has been locally
      fied to punch an IEBUPDTE deck with  SPF statistics in the above f
      It does not punch  ./ ALIAS statements, however.

      The SPF  data is in  the 'comments' area of  the statement so  the
      could be run thru 'IEBUPDTE' successfully.  It would just ignore t
      data.
0     The format of the 50-byte SPF field  is fixed.  Each value must ha
      correct number  of digits (use leading  zeroes if necessary).   On
      10-byte 'id' field at  the end may have a variable  length.  No im
      blanks allowed.   Values must be separated by  a hypen as above.
      data does not conform to these rules,   the member will still be w
      but without SPF statistics.
0     Input (SYSUT1)   DCB attributes need  not be  specified if the  fi
      standard labels.  If it is an unlabeled  tape,  only the BLKSIZE n
      specified (if it is not 80).
0     If the output  file does not have  attributes in its label  and no
      specified in  the SYSUT2  DD statement,   the program  will set  t
      LRECL=80, BLKSIZE=3120.

+              _____
0       The SCRAMBLE CLIST invokes a utility processor to Encipher or
        Decipher your dataset according to the NBS standard algorithm.
        You supply a 1 to 8 alpha-numeric keyword, from which a 48 bit
        code key will be produced.  This code key is applied to each 8
        bytes (64 bits) of your dataset.  Each record in the designated
        dataset is read, en- or deciphered, and re-written in place. The
        utility can handle records of FB or VB format with an LRECL in t
        range of 8 to 256 bytes.  Note that the algorithm is designed to
        work only on multiples of 8 bytes, so if the LRECL is NOT a
        multiple of 8, then up to 7 bytes per record may be unprocessed.
0       WARNING: this utility operates on the actual dataset by using th
                 read-and-update-in-place technique.  If you forget the
                 that you used to encipher the dataset, KISS THE DATA GO
                 because we have no way of deciphering the data again.
0       If you are hopelessly paranoid, you can encipher the enciphered
        dataset with a different key to really grunge up the data.  The
        decipherion process must be the exact inverse of the encipher pr
        in order to recover the original data again.  (see example 2)

0           All SMART commands must  start in column 1 and are  signifie
      slash asterisk (/*) or a period period (..).   SMART Commands may
      not require operands which are separated  by 1 space.   Any input
      which contains a /* or ..  In columns 1  and 2 and is not a comman
      processed as  a normal input record.    All commands in this  manu
      prefixed by the /*, but they could have been prefixed by a ..  .
      commands may be entered in either upper or lower case. It is recom

      Effect until they are encountered.  For example,  if the /*index c
      is put in the middle of the  document,  the index will only contai
      numbers which are found after the /*index command.
0          If a  command is invalid,  SMART  will display the command  i
      document.  There are  several reasons for invalid  commands.  Eith
      command is misspelled, there are invalid operands,  or the syntax
      valid. Some commands must appear in pairs, such as /*top . If you
      to put in the  second command,  some of the manual  may not print.

      words to be included  in the index are described on  the following
      up to the next /*index card.  There are  up to two operands which
      specified.  The first operand, if specified,  is the delimiter cha
      between each index word.  If omitted, the default delimiter is the
      (,). The only restriction of the delimiter character is that it ca
      a space or a  number.  The next operand,  if specified  is the amo
      storage to be  aquired for the index processing.  The  default amo
      30000 bytes. Any amount may be specified, but it must be more than
      bytes.  If the  index processing runs out of storage,   the progra
      terminate with a u0010 abend. An example of the /*index command wh

      the first  occurrence of  the just  command causes  justification
      turned on and the next occurrence turns it off. The next occurrenc
      turn it on  again and so forth.  Only  lines which have more  word
      line than spaces left after the last  word are justified.  So,  th
      line in a paragraph are not justified if it does not end close eno
      the right margin (like this line).
0          The left margin is always left alone.

             that you are turning justification off.
           The /*level command  is usable only when  columns 79 and 80
      input records contain a modification level  number of that record.
      is true for data which has been  created using TSO SPF edit with s
      tics on. The level command has one operand which specifies the mod
      tion level number.   Any records which have a  modification level
      greater than  or equal to  the number  specfied on the  /*level co
      will be marked with a  in front of that line. This allows users t

           The /*spell command provides a means  to check the spelling o
      manual.  Presently SMART contains a database  of about 3000 words
      growing by leaps and bounds.  SMART Checks  the spelling of the wo
      your manual and compares  it with this list.  If the  word is not
      this list, the word is considered to be misspelled and is underlin

      string of letters are considered to be  words by SMART.  That is,
      which contain numbers and or special characters are considered mor
      one word.  For example,  the word SMART would be considered two wo
      SMART, the words are sft and mv. Most manuals have special words a
      breviations which are unique to that manual. They may be included
      word list only for that manual.  These  words should be put on the
      following the /*spell command.  More than one  word can be put on
      and they are to be separated by a  space.  Once all of the special
      have been entered,  they should be followed  by a /*spell card to
      SMART that the end of the special words have been reached.  If you
      ual does not contain any special words,   or you wish to see which
      you need to add to your word database, you will need to have two /
      cards in a row.
           There may be one operand to the spell command.  It is the num
      bytes to be used for spelling checking.  The default value is 100k
      there is not enough storage available, a u0020 abend will occur.
            An example of how  SMART denotes a misspelled word is  on th
      line.  This word is mispelled.  An example  of the /*spell cards u
      this manual  is:   /*ignore  /*spell std s  c eeeee  ooooo ccccc
      pgsize nospace granted x jon doe ts te tf FBA  cyl z c r t ast c o
      PGM sft mv sysut v u subsec n chars tn rrrr /*ignore /*spell
0     Optionally,  SMART can produce a misspelling  cross reference at t
      of the manual. This cross reference will display each word that is
      pelled and the page number it occurs on. Only about 200 words can
      corded. If there are more than that misspelled, you will need to c
      those words and rerun  the manual to display the rest  of the miss
      words. To turn on the cross reference, you will need to use the m
      eter.  If there are no misspelled words,  this section will not be
      uced.
           The /*spchk command either turns on or off spelling checking.
      command is  used to eliminate  certain parts  of a manual  from sp
      checking. There may be one operand which are either "on" or "off"
      operand must start  in column 9 (1 space  after the k in  spchk).
      operand is present,  then the spelling checking is either turn off
      depending on the present condition of the spelling checking. That
      spelling checking  is on and a  spchk command is encountered  with
      operand,  then spelling checking is turned off.  And likewise,  if
      off, it is turned on.
           The /*center command will take the data on the rest of the ca
      center in on the line. For example, to perform the following:
                                  this is centered

0        This is an estae exit which displays the abend completion code,
      and register contents, then continues termination.
0        The STAE$ macro, requiring absolutely no operands, builds the p
      ter list to be passed to this exit, loads this exit, and issues an
      svc,  which  will cause  this exit to  gain control in  the event
      abend.
0        As an option,  a list of csect  names and boundaries may be pas
      the exit.  If the psw is within any  of the bound- aries,  the off
      the psw address  from the beginning of  the csect is displayed,
      bytes of storage at the psw address minus  6 is dumped to show the
      ing instruction.
0      The parameters passed are:
       (1) the address of an option field and a list of
           csect names and boundaries.
       (2) The address of a 256 byte workarea
0        The first word  of the option field contains flag  bits for dir
      the messages via tput or wto.
0        The second  word of the option  field may optionally  contain r

-       Function   : To process held SYSOUT data-sets for the currently
                     running job by:
                     1) selecting all BAL listings to
                        FICHE and-or to the specified output
                        VOLUME or MSVGP
                     2) selecting all non-BAL listings to
                        DD other
                     3) copying all INPUT to copy DD
                     4) IDCAMS is invoked to delete and uncatalog the
                        listing file prior to allocation on MSS or dasd
0                    The FICHE DD statement is dynamically allocated
                     and freed for each assembly listing.  If you are
                     under JES3 then you will need to have a FORMAT PR c
                     specifying the output DEST and FORM # or ---
                     you can change the ALLOC macro for the FICHE DD to
                     include the DEST and FORM #
                     (FORM # is a max of 4 characters for DYNALLOC)
0                    The output should in SYSOUT=(A,wtrname) to be
                     processed.  It should not be in a TSO hold class !!
                                  (unless you plan to run this processor
                                                          under TSO)
0                    NOSPL requires that the input file have the ddname
                     of INPUT.
0                    To use NOSPL for SMP SYSPRINT you will have to code
                     a DCB of RECFM=FBA,LRECL=121,BLKSIZE=1210 on the
                     SMP SYSPRINT DD card if it is pointed to tape or
                     dasd. - This is for NOSPL only...... Do not code
                     a DCB on your SMP SYSPRINT unless this is your
                     output WTR .
0                    RECFM=FBM will be honored for FICHE and BAL output

-          This program is IBM property and is internal use only.
           VSAMDIAG is not supported, but any problem encountered will
           will be looked at on a best effort basis. Please submit the
           portable failing data set to: VSAM ct.  Attn. Jerry Grey.
           The install deck contains the object deck for VSAMDIAG and
           the necessary linkage editor control cards to link VSAMDIAG
           into SYS1.LINKLIB With authorization.
0          VSAMDIAG is a field developed VSAM data set diagnostic
           program. It is mainly designed to examine separatly the index
           component and the data component of a VSAM KSDS.
           Examination of the index component is mainly done by a
           cross-checking of the vertical and horizontal pointers in
           the index CI's and further checking the whole data component
           described by the indexes.
           Examination of the data component is done by logical sequenti
           reading of all the data CI's allocated, even for FREE space C
           Record is checked, as well as key sequence and FREE space goo
           erasure. Update integrity of spanned records is also checked.
           VSAMDIAG Does not modify anything in the data set, but only
           indicates if there is a data integrity problem, and what is
           wrong in that case.
           VSAMDIAG Can also search through the indexes to retrieve the
           CI of each level in which a key given as an argument should b
           This is accomplished by horizontal scanning of the index, and
           is complimentary of other usual get direct methods. You can
           also retrieve the data CI that should containe the given key.

             as the data tests must read all the data CI's, it uses
           asynchronous processing to optimize its performance. You can
           specify, in the SYSIN ddcard, the number of buffers that you
           wish in order to obtain the best pass time. The default value
           of three should be good in most cases. Note, too many buffers
           may result in excessive pagination.

              To estimate the necessary time to run the data test,
            get the hurba(high used RBA) and the data cisize from
            the catalog for the data set to test:
0              Elapsed time = (hurba * 0.03) / Cisize
               (in seconds)
             for a full 3330, cisize = 1024, about one hour.

      chine-readable extract  of the  CATALOG may  be written  on SYSUT2
      which will include records for GDG indices.

      control card data can start in col.  1 or later and must be comple
      col. 71 (No continuations)
0        One operand must  be CATALOG= (MVS only),  NODE= (MVS  only),
      (MVS or MVT).  CATALOG=index where index is an alias for an OS CVO
      list the indicated CVOL.  NODE=index will list entries starting 'i
      In the indicated CVOL.  Index may be multiple levels and can have
      mediate levels omitted,   I.E.   NODE=abc..Xyz will list  datasets
      first level of qualifi- cation is abc  and whose third level of qu
      cation is xyz,  any other levels of qualification may occur.  NODE
      is also valid with either the CATALOG= or DD= parameter.  DD=ddnam
      list the CVOL indicated  by that DD card (this is  the operand for
      the dsname must be specified in the DD card (usually SYSCTLG, but
      any dataset in CVOL format).
0        The options  may follow the first  operand and are separated  f
      and each other by commas with a blank ending the options.  The fir
      tion is 'check' to  read all CATALOG blocks and do  validity check
      the CATALOG, this should not be needed very often (every few month
      more than doubles the excp count.
0        The second option is  'GDG=n' where is a 1-4 digit  number givi
      maximum number of generations before GDG  indices are listed on SY
      (default is GDG=8).  If GDG=255 is specified,  no indices will be
      for either  excessive generation count  or because the  generation
      specifies 'NODELETE'.

         The third option is 'NODE=index' where only 'index.' Data sets
      be listed  and the  CATALOG was  allocated with  DD=ddname CATALOG
      (where the two indices are different).
0        The fourth option is 'SEEK' and will  do a SEEK analysis on the
      LOG structure (or the part you are listing).
0        The fifth option is  'FH' which is the same as 'SEEK'  but if p
      the CATALOG resides  on the fixed head  portion of a 3340  or 3350
      movement into that area is treated as a fixed head SEEK SEEK,  any
      ment out  of the fixed  head area is calculated  based on the  las
      cylinder.
0        The sixth through ninth options are 'CHKALL', 'CHKREAL', 'FIXAL
      'FIXREAL',  they either check or correct  the DSCB TTR's in the CA
      'ALL' or 'REAL' refers to all dasd or real (non-mss) dasd being ch
      Checking mss can be very slow due to the mount time.
0        The tenth option is 'EXIT=xxxxxxxx' where xxxxxxxx is a 1-8 cha
      exit program name. This program receives control whenever a data s
      try is to be printed and its return code tells whether to print th
      set entry (zero) or not (non-zero).  The call parameters are the d
      name,  the device name of the  first volume,  the volume count (ha
      binary)  and the  volume information.  Each volume  information en
      twelve bytes long and consists of the device type (4 bytes),  the
      serial (6 bytes)  and the tape  file number (halfword binary).  Th
      number is zero for a dasd data set.  If the DSN is blank,  it is t
      of the CATALOG, do any final processing in your exit program.
0     Examples:
      NODE=abc.Xyz  this will list entries starting abc.Xyz.
0     CATALOG=a,GDG=11  this will list the CATALOG containing index a
                        and GDGs with more than 11 data sets will
                        be listed on SYSERROR
0     DD=CVOL1,CHECK  this will list the CVOL described by DD CVOL1
                      and check all CATALOG blocks
0     DD=CVOL1,NODE=a  as above but no checking and list a. Entries
-
         Under MVS  this should be an  authorized program if it  isn't a
      ized, it will not ENQ on the CATALOG(s) and it will be swappable.

-     These commands allow the user to invoke  a TSO command or call a p
      without the requirement that  the TSO command be in the  linklist
      program library name be  specified on the call.   If a  tasklib is
      cated,  these commands will search the tasklib first for the TSO c
      or program.
0     An optional parameter is provided to allow  you to specify the ddn
      be used as  the tasklib and if  used must be the  first parameter
      fied.
0          The basic syntax is:
0          $C command-name  operands
           @C     "           "
           $P program-name  'parm'

           LIB may be abbreviated as L and defines a dataset to be
           used as the tasklib.
-
           These commands require that they be in MLPA/PLPA if you requi
      authorized functions.  To become authorized they issue the SPF SVC
      will set the JSCBAUTH flag only if the caller is in MLPA/PLPA.   A
      also invoked  to determine if the  caller has authorization to  us

0     It can also copy a member of a  pds,  but when copying one member
      other the directory information is not  copied,  so a load module
      with this command would not be executable.   See the COPYPDS comma
      copying one or more members from one pds to another.
0     Both data sets must exist beforehand -  this command does not allo
      new data set.

      3.25   OUTPRINT
+     3.25   OUTPRINT
+            ________
-     Description.
      This TSO command prints a data set created by the 'OUTPUT'
      command, with proper carriage controls, if the data set
      contains either ASA or machine carriage controls or both.
      It does not work right if the data set contains no carriage
      controls.  It helps if the OUTPUT command is modified
      to default to LRECL 133 instead of 132 (see zap below).
0     Syntax -
             OUTPRINT 'dsname'  CLASS(a)  DEST(remote)  HOLD COPIES(nn)
0     The purpose of this command is to read a data set created
      by the TSO 'OUTPUT' command 'PRINT(dsname)' operand,
      and print it with correct carriage controls.  The data
      set often has both ASA and machine type carriage controls
      mixed together, and is marked with a RECFM indicating
      neither ASA nor machine controls present.
0     Sometimes the data set contains records with no carriage
      controls at all.  This produces unpredictable results,
      and there is nothing in this command that can
      detect that situation, so the user just has to avoid
      generating sysout that has no carriage controls if it is
      to be processed by the OUTPUT command and then this command.
0     This command was written so that a job's sysout could be
      retrieved (by OUTPUT), saved in a data set, and printed
      at a later time with no separator pages between each sysout
      file.  (The separator pages will be from the TSO session
      that issues this command instead of the original job,
      but everything else will look like the original job).
0     The 'OUTFILE' keyword lets you specify the DDNAME of a
      pre-allocated data set to which this command will write
      instead of allocating its own sysout file.  If the DCB
      attributes of the OUTFILE conflict with those of the input,
      unpredictable results may occur.  If the OUTFILE is a PDS
      with no member specified, the directory will be destroyed.
      The 'OUTFILE' keyword causes the 'CLASS', 'DEST', 'COPIES',
      and 'HOLD' keywords to be ignored.
0     OUTPUT command problem.
      If you let the 'OUTPUT' command create the data set, it will
      make the LRECL 132.  If the sysout data being retrieved by
      the 'OUTPUT' command contains 133 byte records, a terrible
      thing happens to the data - the first 132 bytes are written
      to one record, and then the 133rd byte is written in a
      second record, in column 1 (the carriage control position),
      padded with 131 blanks.
0           Page 345    Operating System and Technology Utilities Manual
1
-
      If you retrieved data containing some 133 byte records and
      some shorter records, there is no way, repeat no way for
      this command or any other software to figure out which
      of the 132 byte records are complete records and which are
      segments of longer records.
0     If you dont zap the 'OUTPUT' command, and your data is 133
      bytes long, you must pre-allocate the data set with an
      attribute of LRECL(133) before using the 'OUTPUT' command
      if you intend to print the data properly.
0     If an unqualified data set name is entered, the
      catalog must be read twice, once to append a
      trailing qualifier if necessary, and again during
      allocation. The user can eliminate the first by using
      the fully qualified name, prefix and all, in quotes,
      or by entering all but the prefix, without quotes,
      plus the keyword 'Q'. The latter is much simpler
      and gives the same performance improvement as a
      fully qualified name.
0     The 'FILE' keyword is useful for printing temporary
      data sets.  It tells the command to treat the first
      operand as a filename (DDNAME) instead of a dsname.
      Whatever data set is currently allocated to the
      filename will be printed (and quickly, because
      the command doesnt have to allocate anything).
0     Note - if a non-existent member of a PDS is specified,
      the command will abend with 013-18.

        'Filename' - the DDNAME allocated to the data set to be examined
        The first operand is assumed to be a DSNAME unless it us followe
        by the keyword 'file'.
0       FILE     - this keyword indicates that the first operand is
                   a filename, not a DSNAME.  This is useful for looking
                   at a temporary data set or at concatenated libraries.
                   A member name may be specified in the first operand
                   after the DDNAME if the DDNAME is allocated to a
                   PDS. This allows you to enter 'REVIEW SYSPROC(x) F'
                   to look at member 'x' in whatever PDS is allocated to

0       For data sets that have a record format of undefined, the block
        in the DSCB is the maximum length of any physical record in the
        set.  The block size in the DSCB can be increased without causin
        problems.  But if the block size is decreased, the blocks that a
        longer than the block size will cause errors conditions when
        accessing these blocks.

        possible (largest 2k multiple record that is less than the block

      of SPF).   Then enter %SYSLOG.   A  panel will be displayed contai
      list of time spans for all SYSLOG data sets for the last month.  Y
      scroll through  the list and  choose any one of  the data sets.
      choose to BROWSE it,  you will enter SPF BROWSE directly against t

      ters. The output from LOGSCAN may be BROWSEd and/or printed.
0        The SYSLOG time span is derived from  the data set name,  which
      the form 'ASYSLOG.Dyyddd.Thhmm',  where yyddd and  hhmm are the da
      time the data set was written to MSS.   You may notice some anomal

      are entered by an operator, they may not be completely accurate.
      dition,  SYSLOG is written by two system components.   The vast ma
      of SYSLOG consists of JES3 DLOG,  which  is a copy of MLOG (printe
      sole hard copy).   However, MCS (MVS Multiple Console Support) wil
      ate its  own SYSLOG  output whenever  JES3 does  not process  a me
      This will happen under two circumstances.   First, IPL messages ar
      ated prior to JES3 initialization.    Second,  some messages are w
      specifically to an MCS console only,  such  as the response to a D
      command.   Note also that it is  possible to write the currently a
      lated SYSLOG to MSS at any time,  so there may be multiple MSS dat
      for one day.

-     Description
+     ___________
0     This is the TSO0 Dialog Program.
0     This program was written at CNA Insurance  to replace the option 6
      delivered with  the PDF Version of  ISPF.  The significant  proble
      that version is after  typing a TSO command on the  screen,  if th
      hit his PFk2 (SPLIT) screen key, the TSO command is lost.
0     s version has the following features:
0     The SPLIT screen bug described above is resolved.
0     The user now has 2 data entry lines  for option 6 (Similar to VM V
      2).  The first data  entry line is the regular ISPF  Command Line
      used for that  purpose.  The Second data  entry line is the  TSO C
      Line. This must only be used for TSO Commands.  Command Stacking u
      delimiter is supported for both lines.
0     The screen will now remember the last command entered every time y
      voke this option.  If the last command  was a stack of TSO Command
      will now remember the entire list.
0     When executing a stack of  TSO Commands,  if a command ends  with
      zero return code, the user will be prompted - do you want to conti
      not.

      new option 6 delivered with this PDS  it will remember the last co
      it is very helpfull to say 'bring up  option 6' for a second.  Whe
      ting PF3 (END) you then return to the currently running function.
0     For example:
0     COMMAND ===> TSOCMD
0     will put the user on the current  option 6 found on ISR@PRIM.   Wh
      user hits the END Pfkey, he will return to this screen. A user may
      PFKEY to TSOCMD.
-     Installation
+     ____________
0     Update your current System Command Table (ISPCMDS)  to include the
      woing entry:
0     VERB    T    ACTION ----    -    ------ TSOCMD  0    SELECT PGM(TS
      PARM(&ZPARM)
-     The member in this PDS called TSOCMD@ contains JCL to move the app
      ate components to their libraries. Run this JCL.
-     This program will  actually look at the current Primary  Option Me
      invoke option 6 the same way it does.  If you have modified the op
      on the primary  option panel,  you DO  NOT have to modify  this pr
      This command used to only display option 6.  Now,  if the command
      tered with some parms, for example:
0     COMMAND ===> TSOCMD ALLOC F(X) SYSOUT(P)
0     this command  will initialize the option  6 screen with the  comma
      hit enter for the  user.  The user remains in option 6  as if he e
      TSOCMD without any parms at all.

             what would happen if channel 1 is defined in line 6.  With
             an FCB is loaded after the separator page is printed.  At t
             time, the forms are positioned at the first print line on a
             When the load occurs, the printer assumes the forms are
             positioned at line 1.  A skip to channel 1 will cause the p
             to space 5 lines.  Thus, the first print line is now 5 line
             the page from where it should be.  All output printed from
             until an operator wakes up will be skewed by 5 lines.  It i

         The symbolic register on the left hand side of the '' is used
          indicate whether or not the load instruction is desired.
         The chain is established from last to first using the continuin
          (longer) chains to provide the nodes for the branches.
         To add a new entry, or a chain of entries:
          a. Locate the position where the new entry belongs on the
             chaining diagram.
          B. If the addition is an extension of an existing chain then
             establish new symbolic registers for the new instructions
             beginning with the end of the chain and working forward.
          C. If the addition is a parallel chain, then use the right han
             symbolic register number as the right hand number at the
             beginning of the new chain. Finish numbering the rest of th
             chain from last to first.  Follow the diagram for the SSIB
             SJB to JCT as an example.  (&S7 is the common register of t
             JSCB block. The value of &S13 will equal the value of &S7 i
             the chain is loaded from the TCB. &S13 will be null and &S7
             will be the register of the JSCB if the JSCB is provided as
             a starting address.)
          D. Code the proper SETC and AIF statements to set the new symb
             registers.  Use the existing statements as a guide.  Also b
             up the conditional load statements. The new code should be
             in the macro in the logical relationship to the rest of the
             chains.  That is put the code between the instructions that
             chaining diagram indicate.

-     This macro provides a dynamic allocation  function by building a d
      allocation parameter list and invoking SVC 99.
0     It first sets up a workarea environment  for the parameter list an
      tests the keywords  supplied and invokes inner macros to  build th
      units.  The  inner macros themselves use  inner macros to  update
      variables, store text unit pointers etc there are three ways of sp
      ing the work area address.
0     A) MF=AUTO, MF=G, MF=(E,address,lnthsymb).
      In the  first form,  an  inner macro DYNSPACE is  called to name
      area,  the  name being returned in  the global SETC variable  &DYN
      DSECT is  created to map this  area.   The global variables  &dtuo
      unit offset counter)  and &DTUPO  (text unit pointer offset accumu
      are set to zero.  These accumulators are updated as each text unit
      essor aquires storage.  After all text units have been built, the
      of space used is calculated, and the DYNSPACE macro is then called
-           Page 425    Operating System and Technology Utilities Manual

-
      to log the amount needed. DYNSPACE Sets a global variable &DYNSPQ
      highest amount any ALLOC or FREE  macro requested,  and when calle
      the expand option, (no operands or name field supplied),  expands
      ds for that quantity. (See DYNSPACE)
0     MF=G specifies  that the ALLOC macro  enter the begin macro  worka
      acquire the storage necessary.  It does  this via the RCPDS macro.
      RCPDS).  However,  if the ALLOC macro  is called several times wit
      option,  a lot of  storage will be used up,  as the  storage will
      shared.  Thus,  this form should only be used if the ALLOC/FREE ma
      only to be used once or twice during an assembly.
0     MF=E causes the macro to use a user specified work area. The secon
      ameter gives the name of the  workarea,  and an optional third par
      is the name of a symbol to be equated to the length of the require
      area.
0     Dynamic allocation  functions are similar  to those available  wit
      using the same keywords.  However,  certain formats are slightly d
      ent.  For instance, certain keywords can have varying parameters,
      taset name,  DDNAME,  VOLSER etc.   Provision  is made for both va
      specification.    In the  absolute form,   the parameter  is enter
      quotes,
      ex.    ALLOC DSN='SYS1.LINKLIB',DISP=SHR
      however, this name remains fixed for the assembly.  In the variabl
      mat,  the address of a locator is specified,  where the locator co
      of a six byte field,  the first 4 bytes of which point to the para
      while the next two contain the length.
0     ex.         ALLOC DSN=LOCATOR
         LOCATOR  DC    A(dsn),Y(12)
         DSN      DC    C'SYS1.LINKLIB'
0     Numeric quantities e.g.  COPIES= for sysout, should either specify
      meric value, COPIES=3, a value in a register,  COPIES=(r3),  or th
      off a fullword containing the value, COPIES=numcopys,  where numco
      the name of a fullword field.
0     Other keywords such as DISP= can only have the absolute form, and
      should not be entered within quotes.   Additional facilities not a
      ble with JCL are the return by the system of information on the da
      eg DSORG.  This is done by specifying DSORGRT=symbol,  where symbo
      symbol which will  be equated to a  two byte field containing  the
      type (see Job Management, Supervisor and TSO).
0     The system can also generate and return a DDNAME. This is carried
      entering DDNTO=(addr1,addr2,,...)   Where addr1,addr2  etc are the
      of 8 byte fields which are to receive the DDNAME.
0     Note that WAITDSN=YES, WAITVOL=YES or WAITUNIT=YES require that th
      gram be APF authorized, or in Key 0-7, or in supervisor state.

-     This is an inner macro to ALLOC/FREE.  It is called to:
0        1.  Name an area for the parmlist
0        2.  Log the various amounts needed by each,  remembering the la
             est.
0        3.  Generating a DS for the largest amount.
0     The first two functions are invoked  by ALLOC/FREE macros only,  a
      third is used by the programmer, either explicitly,  or by BEGINWK
      the latter is used.
0     To invoke the naming function, ALLOC/FREE generate:
0     name DYNSPACE
0     Note.  The naming operation  only generates a name on the  first c
      the assembly.  The name remains the same until DYNSPACE is called
      pand into a DS.
0     The second function is invoked by the macro call
           DYNSPACE ADD
0     (no name field and one operand)  it  uses the global variables &dt
      &DTUPO to calculate the space for this request, and updates &DYNSP
      if the current request is for a greater amount
0     The third function is  invoked by calling DYNSPACE with no  name o
      rand field.
0     This expands  into a  define storage,  clears  the DYNSPACE  name
      SETC, and the &DYNSPQ GLOBAL SETA.  Thus, the macro is serially re
      in all functions.

0     The use of the @ character for run-time values is stressed.
0     The dynamic  allocation macros will  take addresses of  values not
      at assembly  time.  to indicate that  an operand of a  DDD or FREE
      cro is an address of a value rather than a value itself, add the c
      ter '@' to the end of an RX-type address in the operand.
0     The DCB=BUFNO keyword,  the DCB=KEYLEN keyword,   the first or onl
      parameter  of  the   COPIES  keyword,   and  the   VOLUME  count s
      ameter of the  VOLUME keyword of the DDD macro  are no longer limi
      values less than 128.
0     The DDD  macro supports the following   operands which may  be use
      when    executing     under    MVS/XA:      BURST=,       CHARS=,
      IES=(,(group,values)), FLASH=, MODIFY=, UNIT=(,,DEFER).
0     The default  error exit  has been  changed to  invoke IKJEFF18  to
      a WTO describing the error.
0     The   macros will   work   in 31-bit   addressing   mode under   M
      (since IKJEFT18  operates in 24-bit  addressing mode,    the defau
      ror  exit routine  should  not be  used  if  the  literal pool  or
      ing storage are above the 16 megabyte line.)
0     The use of  '@' for specifying text  unit parameter values not  kn
      assembly time is now documented.
0     The KEYADDS keyword  of the DDD,   DDI and FREEDD macros will acce
      dresses of fullwords pointing to text units.

       The dynamic  allocation macros perform  "dynamic allocation",  "d
      unallocation" and "dynamic concatenation".
0     Those operands of the macros that have  equivalents in the JCL DD
      ment may all be coded  the  same way as they are in JCL  (with a f
      ceptions noted in this manual).     those operands that specify  n
      values  may   also   be  coded   as  non- relocatable  assembler e
      sions.
0     As  support  for  text  UNIT  parameter  values not   known  at as
      time,  any  operand  whose  corresponding text  UNIT contains a  p
      ter value  (with a  few exceptions  noted in this manual)   may be
      as an RX-type   address expression followed by the  character '@'.
      RX-type  address must  point to  storage   containing the   value
      placed into   the text UNIT for  that operand.   values for  opera
      varying lengths must  be padded  to  the  maximum length  allowed.
      macros supply the text unit key, number and length.
0     They use  global symbols   to determine the  length of  a  work ar
      whether certain features have been used.

             text units.   an  RX-type address not followed by  a '@' is
             the address of a text unit.  an RX-type address followed by
             a '@' is  the address of a fullword  containing the address
             of a text unit.   a register (enclosed in parentheses) must
             contain the address of a text unit and must not be followed
             by a '@'.
                default: none.
             EXIT=      specifies an  RX-type address  of or  (register)
             containing the  address of  a user  error-handling routine.
             code in the  DDDD macro will branch to this  routine if the
             return code from dynamic allocation is not 0.  registers on

                      register 14  - return address to  resume execution
                      as if the return code from SVC 99 had been 0.   if
                      the DDD macro was not part of a concatenation this
                      will be the address of the first instruction after
                      the DDD macro.
                      register  15  -  address   of  the  error-handling
                      routine.

                      (points to a fullword that contains the address of
                      the dynamic allocation request block).
                      registers 2 thru 13 -  unchanged from entry to the
                default:  a routine internal to  the macros that invokes
             IKJEFF18  to issue  a  diagnostic  WTO,  and  issues  abend
             specifying user abend  code 99 with dump.   ALODFAIL is the
             label  of   the  default  error-handling  routine   in  the
             expansion of  the DDDD  macro (code).   your error-handling
             routine  may exit  to the  default error-handling  routine,
             which will  issue a diagnostic WTO  and abend user  99,  by
             branching to the label ALODFAIL.
0            NOTE: the ALODFAIL routine is generated as part of the DDDD
             code expansion only  if some previous DDD,   FREEDD or CONC
             macro left the exit=  parameter unspecified.  if necessary,
             code a parameterless DDD macro and  ORG back over it before
             the DDDD code macro.
-     NOTES:
0            To request the return of the  DDNAME,  code 'RETURN' as the
                 DDNAME.   when 'RETURN' is specified  in the label of a
                 DDD  macro,  DDD  does not  use  it as  the DDNAME  but
                 instead includes a text unit  for return of the DDNAME.
                 the label on the text unit  for return of the DDNAME is
                 always  'ALORTDDN'.     after  the  DDD   is  executed,
                 ALORTDDN+4 contains the halfword length of the returned
                 DDNAME  and  ALORTDDN+6 contains  the  returned  DDNAME
                 left-justified and padded with blanks to length 8.

      DDTU (data definition   text units)   - define   dynamic allocatio
+     ____  ____ __________   ____ _____    _ ______   _______ _________
      units
-     Purpose:  the DDD macro generates text  units whose values are kno
      assembly  time.    the   DDTU macro  aids in   coding dynamic allo
      text units  whose values  are not  known until execution time.
0     In many programs,   even  those where text unit values are  not kn
      assembly time,  the  DDTU macro is  not necessary.  the  dynamic a
      tion  macros  DDD   and  FREEDD will take addresses of  values not
      at assembly time.  to indicate that an operand  of a DDD or FREEDD
      is an address of a value rather than a value itself,   add the cha
      '@' to  the end of   an RX-type address  in the  keyword  operand.
      run-time value facility  is easier to use  and maintain than DDTU.
      is  necessary only for those text  UNITs that do not take a value,
      as TERM=TS,   and those  that can take more than  one  value,    s
      VOL=ser=  for more  than one VOLUME.
0     The  DDTU macro,    modeled  after  the  JCL  DD  statement,  cons
      dynamic allocation text  UNITs with user-supplied labels.
0     Code the DDTU   macro with JCL keywords  whose  value will not  be
      until execution  time.  For  each value  not known until execution
      code an  assembler symbol not defined elsewhere in the program.
0     The text  UNITs generated  are a  halfword key,    a halfword numb
      following-parameters which is  either 0 or 1,   and,  if  1,  a ha
      length.   The length, if present,  is always the maximum length th
      namic allocation will  accept for the text unit being created.
0     Text units formed by DDTU may  be used in dynamic allocation by sp
      ing their labels as subparameters of the  KEYADDS= keyword on the
      FREEDD macros,  or copying them  to a workarea,    MODIFYing them,
      specifying  the   workarea addresses  as subparameters  of the  KE
      keyword.
0     The DDTU macro expansion contains no executable code.
-     Syntax:
+     ______
        name              'return' coded as the name will be used
                          as the label of a text unit for
                          specifying the return of the DDNAME.  any
                          other value is used as the label of a
                          text unit for specifying DDNAME.

      7.11   CVTOD - CONVERT TOD MACRO
+     7.11   CVTOD - CONVERT TOD MACRO
+            _____ _ _______ ___ _____
0        This macro was stolen from a UCLA TSO command called DUMPINFO a
      converted to a macro by L. Dyck for generalized use.  It's purpose
      convert a TOD to something meaningful to us human beings.
0        To use this  macro simply code CVTOD in your  assembler languag
      gram.   It will generate inline code  including it's own data cons
      If NOGEN  is specified then  the output fields  will be assumed  t
      been allocated,   which can be done by coding the DATA to cause on
      generation of the output fields.
0        This macro requires that on entry register 1 contain the addres
      double word containing  a TOD value.   On  exit you can access  th
      verted values  either via the  labels or use  register 1 which  wi
      contain the address of the converted data.
0        To use this  macro in a reentrant  program you will have  to de
      DSECT and invoke the macro using the DATA option.  Then in the CSE
      voke the macro using the NOGEN option.

-               It simplifies the coding of a screen in the following wa
                .  Buffer addresses are specified as row and column numb
                   The macro translates them into the 3270 code.
                .  Orders are specified by name, such as 'SBA' and 'SF',
                   you do not have to know the hex codes for them.
                .  Commonly used attribute bytes are specified by name (
                   of reserved names) so you do not have to know the hex
                   for them.
                .  It saves a lot of documentation work, and makes the c
                   easier for others to understand.
0               The user of the macro must still understand how a screen
                constructed before using it.  The macro merely makes it
                to specify the values.  It does very little error checki
                For instance, it does not check to see if you follow an
                with a buffer address.  It is possible to code a thoroug
                invalid screen.
0               The macro may have any number of operands, consisting of
                any combination of the following.
0               .  An order.
                   Valid orders are:
                   SBA           set buffer address
                   SF            start field
                   RTA           repeat to address
                   IC            insert cursor
                   PT            program tab
                   EUA           erase unprotected to address
                .  A buffer address in parentheses.
                   If an operand is in parentheses, it is assumed that t
                   and column number are between the parens, separated b
                   comma.  Example: (1,1) This form of buffer address is
                   as of March 18 1982.
                .  A row or column number of a buffer address (old forma

-
                   If an operand is numeric, it is assumed to be
                   a row or column number.  It takes 2 operands to
                   specify the buffer address (row and column) so numeri
                   operands must always be specified in pairs, the
                   first being the row and the second being the column.
                   This format is supported only for compatibility with
                   the original version of this macro.
                .  An attribute byte.
                   Valid attribute bytes are:
                   UNPLO -  unprotected normal intensity
                   UNPHI  - unprotected high intensity
                   UNPNP  - unprotected no-display
                   PROLO  - protected normal intensity
                   PROLOS - protected normal intensity auto-skip
                   PROHI  - protected high intensity
                   PROHIS - protected high intensity auto-skip
                .  A hex, character, or address constant.
                   For example, x'00', or c'enter signon'
                   This can be used for data within fields or for
                   attribute bytes, orders, the 'WCC', or buffer
                   addresses (if you want to figure them out).
0               If the operands do not all fit on one line, you can eith
                continue the line in the standard assembler way or code
                macro again on the next line with the remaining operands
                result is the same either way.
0               The buffer address conversions are for a screen size of
                rows by 80 columns. For screens of other dimensions
                43 bu 80, 12 by 40) the macro needs only a few changes.
0               Warning: if you code the macro with a label in column 1,
                you like using length attributes, beware that the length
                attribute of the label is not necessarily the total leng
                the data generated by the macro.

0        These macros have been designed to  provide a generalized keywo
      lidation service for use by any program module requiring keyword v
      tion services.   A character string is passed to this routine cont
      one or more 'KEYWORD(value)' items seperated by commas or blanks.
      passed string is matched with a  keyword validation table.   The k
      validation table defines  what is to occur when a  particular keyw
      the table matches with a keyword in  the string.   The code genera
      this routine is  reentrant and does a getmain.    The following se
      may be requested when a keyword match occurs:
0        -  Move the keyword values,  if there are any,  to an area desi
            by the  caller.    The  format  of  this  area  is  defined
         -  Invoke a user routine  to process a particular  keyword when
            found in the character string.
         -  Validate keyword values  found for the  following characteri
         -  Numeric only
         -  Alphabetic only
         -  Alphabetic, numeric, and the characters @ # . $ *
         -  Min-max count of number of keyword values specified
         -  Perform the following storage-to-storage operations when a k
            is found:
         -  MVC
         -  NC
         -  OC
         -  XC
           This  permits the setting or resetting of flags and the movem
           data when a particular keyword is found.
0     The format of the input character string expected to be received b
      routine is as follows:
0         llKEYWORD(value,value,...),KEYWORD(value,...) /* Comment */
0      -  ll specifies the length of  the input character string  and is
          byte hex field.    The maximum  length which  can be  specifie
          X'ffff'=65,535.
       -  A keyword cannot be greater than 255 bytes in length.
       -  A keyword  value cannot  be greater  than  255  bytes  in  len
       -  Keywords may be seperated by one or more blanks or a single co
       -  Values may be separated only by commas.    Any  embedded blank
          considered as part of the value.
       -  Comments may appear  between any keywords  which are  separate
          blanks.   Comments must be preceeded  and followed by  at leas

      Explanation of Keyword and Positional operands:
0        1.  NAME (POSITIONAL):   THE SUBROUTINE MUST BE  NAMED ARBITRAR
             (ONE TO SIX CHARACTERS MAXIMUM) BY THE USER.  FORTRAN OR CO
             RULES MUST BE FOLLOWED IN CHOOSING A NAME.
0        2.  TYPE (POSITIONAL):  THE TYPE OF VARIABLES TO BE SORTED MUST
             CONVEYED  TO THE  MACRO.   ADMISSIBLE  VALUES ARE:   P=PACK
             C=CHARACTER   OR   ALPHANUMERICS   (=   A-FORMAT   VARIABLE

             AND C  MUST BE SPECIFIED.   THE  LENGTH MUST BE LESS  THAN
             BYTES FOR C OR 16 BYTES FOR P.
0        4.  STRTKY (KEYWORD):  THE COLUMN THE SORTING KEY BEGINS AT MAY
             CHANGED FROM ITS NULL VALUE OF COLUMN 1.
0        5.  KYLGTH (KEYWORD):  THE LENGTH OF THE DESIRED SORTING KEY.
             KYLGTH IS OMITTED, LENGTH MINUS STRTKY IS THE DEFAULT OPTIO

       THE NUMBER OF ELEMENTS OF THE ARRAY TO BE SORTED.
       THE NAMES OF "EXTRA" ARRAYS, IF ANY.
-     SEVERAL EXAMPLES WILL MAKE THE USE OF A MACRO SUBROUTINE CLEAR:
0     PROBLEM 1: SORT THE CHARACTER ARRAY CALLED A OF 500 ELEMENTS OF 80
      BYTES EACH ACCORDING TO AN 8 BYTE KEY STARTING IN COLUMN 20.
      SOLUTION:  THE FOLLOWING CARDS ARE NEEDED:
      // JOB CARD
      // EXEC ASMGC
      //ASM.SYSIN DD *
      (QUICKERSORT MACRO DEFINITION SOURCE CODE IF NOT IN SYSTEM LIBRARY
               QKRSRT SORT1,C,LENGTH=80,STRTKY=20,KYLGTH=8
               END
      (COMMENT: THE NAME SORT1 WAS ARBITRARILY CHOSEN. ONLY THE QKRSRT
      AND END CARD NEED APPEAR IF THE MACRO IS IN THE SYSTEM LIBRARY)
      /*
      // EXEC FORTGCLG
      //FORT.SYSIN DD *
      (FORTRAN DECK WHICH WILL CONTAIN THE FOLLOWING STATEMENT)
          .

          .
      /*
      //GO.SYSIN DD *
      (DATA, IF ANY)
      /*
0     PROBLEM 2: SUPPOSE AN ARRAY OF DOUBLE PRECISION FLOATING POINT
      NUMBERS IS TO BE SORTED.  SUPPOSE THE NAME DBLSRT IS CHOSEN FOR
      THE SUBROUTINE.  THE MACRO PROTOTYPE CARD WOULD THEN READ:
               QKRSRT DBLSRT,D
      HERE THE LENGTH IS IMPLIED TO BE 8 BYTES.  IN THE FORTRAN PROGRAM
      THE STATEMENT "CALL DBLSRT(.....)" WOULD APPEAR.
0     PROBLEM 3: SUPPOSE AN ARRAY OF FIXED POINT NUMBERS IS TO BE SORTED
      ALSO TO BE SORTED ELEMENT FOR ELEMENT WITH THE FIRST ARRAY ARE
      THREE ADDITIONAL ARRAYS.  THE MACRO PROTOTYPE WOULD THEN READ:
               QKRSRT EXSRT,F,EXTRA=3
      HERE THE LENGTH IS IMPLIED TO BE 4 BYTES.  IN THE FORTRAN PROGRAM
      THE STATEMENT "CALL EXSRT(.., .., .., .., ..)" WOULD APPEAR.
0     PROBLEM 4: SUPPOSE A REAL*4 ARRAY WITH DIMENSION ARR(3,100) IS TO
      BE SORTED ON THE SECOND COLLUMN.  THE MACRO PROTOTYPE STATEMENT
0           Operating System and Technology Utilities Manual   Page 468

-
      WOULD THEN READ:
               QKRSRT OVRSRT,C,LENGTH=12,OVRTYP=E,DISP=5
      HERE SORTING WOULD BE DONE ACCORDING TO THE SECOND COLLUMN.  IN TH
      FORTRAN PROGRAM THE STATEMENT "CALL OVRSRT(ARR,100)" WOULD APPEAR.
0     PROBLEM 5: SUPPOSE AN IN LINE SORT IS DESIRED IN AN ASSEMBLER
      ROUTINE, WITH FIXED POINT COMPARES.  THE MACRO PROTOTYPE WOULD
      THEN READ:
               QKRSRT XYZ,F,INLINE=YES
      HERE THE DUMMY NAME "XYZ" IS NOT GENERATED.  ENTERING THE SORT
      ROUTINE, REGISTER 1 MUST CONTAIN THE ADDRESS OF A PARAMETER LIST
      WITH THE ADDRESSES OF: THE ARRAY TO BE SORTED, THE ARRAY LENGTH
      VARIABLE, AND EXTRA ARRAY ADDRESSES IF ANY.  THE CONTAINING CSECT
      MUST USE R(15) FOR A BASE REGISTER.
0     EFFECTIVELY THE USER PROVIDES A ONE INSTRUCTION ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE
      PROGRAM.  THE USER IS NOW ABLE TO SORT ANYTHING ANY WAY.

      7.21   STAE$ MACRO
+     7.21   STAE$ MACRO
+            _____ _____
0     This macro sets up an estae environment for STAE$XIT.
0     STAE$XIT is an estae exit which displays (on the console or a TSO
      nal or both) information about an abend,  including the psw,  regi
      and (if the psw  is within the csect that issued  this macro)  the
      name and the offset of the psw from the beginning of the csect.
0     To use STAE$XIT, you need to add the following 4 statements to you
      gram.
0        1)  Near the beginning of your program, after you've
             set up your base register and (in a re-entrant
             program) getmained a work area, code the STAE$
             macro with no operands.
         2)  Anywhere after the last executable instruction
             (but within the main csect) insert:
               STAE$END EQU   *
             this is used by STAE$XIT to determine if the psw
             is between the start of the csect and here.
         3)  In your work area (which in a re-entrant program
             is usually getmained) insert:
               STAE$WRK DS    32D
               STAE$LST DS    16F
             the first is a work area used by STAE$XIT when
             an abend occurs. The second is a work area used
             by the STAE$ macro at the time it is executed.
0     STAE$LST is broken down as follows
             4F   -  ESTAE MF=L area
             2F   -  2 word parameter list
             5F   -  option list prefix (words 3 and 4 reserved)
             5F   -  first csect descriptor entry
0     The STAE$ macro makes these 4 sections contiguous,  but they may i
      be scattered  if you generate your  own parameter list for  STAE$X
      stead of using this macro.
0     The STAE$XIT  exit is  normally loaded dynamically  by the  STAE$
      This may be unaccepable overhead for certain applications.   By sp
      ing LOAD=NO as  an operand of the  macro,  the macro will  referen
      exit  with a  v-type address  constant instead  of loading  it,  s
      STAE$XIT exit can be link-edited with the issuing program.
0     There are  2 advantages to loading  the exit dynamically.    First
      link-edit step need  not be changed to reference  the library cont
      the STAE$XIT exit.   Second, improvements made to the STAE$XIT exi
      take effect automatically, with no re-linking of your program.

      Messages are normally displayed on a TSO terminal.  For programs n
      ecuting from TSO,  there is a  MSG=WTO operand which causes the me
      to be issued via WTO.   There is  also a MSG=WTOT operand,  which
      messages to be issued thru WTO and TSO both.

0        The source maintenance system under ISPF was developed based up
      following ideas:
0        1.  IBM source maintained systems  require modification to prov
             functions which are  required locally but which  IBM will n
             or currently does not provide.
0        2.  When IBM code is modified,  it  should be modified via SMP
             tracking and control purposes.
0        3.  User code  added to an existing  IBM module must  never del
             any of the original IBM statements.
0        4.  User modification should be developed such that no one modi
             cation is dependent upon the existence of another.
0        5.  All local source modules should be managed under SMP as wel
0        With these ideas as the foundation,  the ISPF Source Maintenanc
      tem was developed.  It was originally coded with JES3 as the initi
      system to be maintained,  but has  proven flexible enough for any
      system.
0        The system is used by entering the  SOURCEM panel of ISPF and s
      ing the source  product to be maintained  (i.e.  option 1 is  JES3
      uction).  Next the SRCMAINT menu is entered.  This menu provides t
      terface to the Source Maintenance system itself.
0        The first time  a user enters the SRCMAINT menu,   the ISPF var
      need to be initialized.   To provide a  simple way to do this,  op
      will take  the user to the  initialization menu.   This menu  allo
      user to initialize all the key variables used in this system.  NOT
      each item on the SOURCEM menu is  entered as a seperate ISPF appli
      id to allow seperate ISPF variable pools for each product.
0        Once the variables are initialized, the user is ready to proced
      the allocation of the datasets designated during initialization.
      datasets are:

      12.1   CROSS CENTER MAINTENANCE COMPATABILITY (CCMC)
+     12.1   CROSS CENTER MAINTENANCE COMPATABILITY (CCMC)
+            _____ ______ ___________ _____________  ____
-        With the introduction of JES3 SP  1.3.1 within the Rockwell com
      environment, the need has been expressed to have all centers at th
      maintenance level.    To accomplish  this we  have enhanced  our c
      source  maintenance system  to include  a facility  called Cross
      Maintenance Compatability or CCMC for short.
0        CCMC is initiated whenever we APPLY via SMP any USERMOD,  APAR
      using the SMPBATCH ISPF Panel.   CCMC  will determine from the SMP
      processing which sysmods have been  successfully applied and then
      ate a  BDT/IUP transfer of  those sysmods from our  PTS to a  data
      each of  the other  centers (which can  be designated  on the  CCM
      panel).
0        The  CCMC dataset  is  a PDS  with  a standard  dataset  name o
      dex.center.SYSMODS.  For exampe for JES3 the index is JES3 and cen
      ECC, MCC, SWCC or WCC.   This will allow CCMC to be used in every
      within Rockwell.
0        This technique should allow each center to be kept as current a
      sible on maintenance.
0        Each center should establish this dataset and periodically brow
      If there is anything in it,  and they wish to APPLY it,  they shou
      load the  PDS to a  sequential file and RECEIVE  it with SMP.    T
      should then  be reset to  empty so that they  will be able  to det
      when new sysmods are received.
0        NOTE: Appropriate ACF2 rules need to be in place to allow these
      sets to be updated.
0        To facilitate receiving into the SMP PTS from the CCMC dataset
      tion has been  added to the ISPF  CCMC menu which will  provide th
      with a simple interface to unload the  CCMC PDS into a format acce
      by SMP RECEIVE processing.  The user is then placed into the SMP R
      processing ISPF panel to do the  actual RECEIVE.   After the Recei
      user is then placed into the ISPF EMPTY panel to allow the user to
      the CCMC dataset to an empty state.
0        There are  two ISPF skeletons  in AOST.ISPSLIB CCMCTRAN  and CC
      To use CCMC include in your SMP  JCL ISPF Skeleton the following c
      statement:
0               )IM CCMCTRAN
0        This will imbed into your Skeleton JCL the CCMCTRAN jcl and wil
      do an imbed of CCMCBDT to do the actual transmission.

         Your Skeleton JCL must also have a test  for CCMC equal to YES
      YES  then  must  allocate  the  SMPLOG   file  to  DSN=&&SMPLOG  w
      DISP=(,PASS).
0        To  facilitate communication  concerning CCMC  information a  d
      should  be   established  in  each  center   having  the  name   o
      dex.center.NOTES.  The DCB should be RECFM=FBA,LRECL=80,DSORG=PS a
      optimal BLKSIZE.   An option has been provided  on the CCMC menu t

+            ____ __________ ___ ________  _________ ___
0     INTRODUCTION
0     The dump  management and analysis  application addresses three  ty
      dumps:  SVC dumps, stand-alone dumps,  and SYSMDUMPs.   All three
      unformatted machine readable  form which must be formatted  by a u
      program.
0     SVC dumps are produced when the system detects an error condition
      the system itself.   The operator may also produce one via the DUM
      sole command.  SVC dumps contain portions of one or more address s
      They reside in SYS1.DUMPnn data set and may be migrated to mass st
0     Stand-alone dumps  are produced by the  operator by IPLing  the AM
      program.  Stand-alone dumps contain all address spaces.   They res
      magnetic tape and are copied to mass store as soon as possible.
0     SYSMDUMPs are produced by problem programs as an alternative to SY
      or SYSUDUMP. They reside in a user data set.
0     GTF (Generalized Trace Facility)  output is produced by the AHLGTF
      ice aid program. GTF output consists of a chronological trace of v
      internal system events.  The output is similar to the system trace
      but contains more information.   It may reside either in a user da
      or in buffers in a dump.
0     The dump management and analysis application uses ISPF panels to f
      tate access to various dump management functions.
0     The dump management  application displays tables of dump  data set
      allows you to select dumps from a table for analysis,  deletion,
      gration to mass store.  Menu items are also provided for auxiliary
      tions which may be useful in selecting a dump (Info/System, softwa
      GREC records, and SYSLOG console output).
0     The dump analysis application provides access to IPCS (Interactive
      lem Control  System),  AMDPRDMP (Print  Dump),  and  auxiliary fun
      which may be useful in analyzing  a dump (software LOGREC,  SYSLOG
      BLIST, Info/System, and SMP/E).  The menus display the available f
      ties in a logical,  structured form.  For those facilities which r
      parameters, panels are provided to prompt for appropriate values.
      sive tutorial panels are provided.
0     IPCS is recommended for most dump analysis rather than AMDPRDMP. I
      interactive.  It is much faster than AMDPRDMP,  produces less extr
      output and  has more capability.   There are  a few functions  uni
      AMDPRDMP. GTF output formatting is the major one.
0     SIMPLE ACCESS

      IPCS must be executed in three layers when used with ISPF.  IPCS m
      executed first, then ISPF,  and finally the dump management and an
      application.
0     All ISPF  data sets must  be allocated  first,  including the  AOS
      sets.  This may  be done via the  the AOSTISPF CLIST.  Then  execu
      IPCSTART CLIST.  Do not execute ISPF or ISPSTART (IPCSTART does th
      tomatically). For example:
0          (1) Place your TSO session in READY mode
           (2) Enter %AOSTISPF
           (3) Enter %IPCSTART
           (4) Select option 2.8 on the AOST master application menu
0     The version (MVS/XA or  MVS/370)  of IPCS must match the  version
      dump you intend to analyze.  IPCSTART will prompt you for the vers
      IPCS you intend use.  The correct version is required for dump ana
      The version is irrelevant for dump management.
0     Dump Management is available even if  you do not use IPCSTART.  Ho
      only limited Dump Analysis will be available.
0     OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
0     IPCSTART provides several  parameters which allow optional  contro
      the initialization of IPCS and ISPF.    All IPCS and ISPF paramete
      supported.
0     You may  wish to execute IPCSTART  in your PROC.CLIST($ON)   CLIST
      overhead extremely small,  and you will  have full ISPF capability
      "OS" parameter  may be  used to inhibit  prompting for  Operating
      version (XA or 370).

-     AMDPSCAN is a  user exit for AMDPRDMP  for  VS2 rel3.8 with se2.
      invoked by using an AMDPRDMP control card with the verb 'SCAN' on
          The objectives of this exit:-
0          1/  To check  various  flags  bits in  the  dump  which may
           contributed to  the failure, but would  not have been  notice
           the PSCE unless he was specifically  looking for them. An exa
           of this would be the 'SQA' critical bit in the GDA.
0          2/ Control  block verification.  VS2 has  many queues  of con
           blocks and a symptom or cause  of system failure is frequentl
           invalid  control block  or  a  corrupted queue.   Scanning  t
           control  blocks 'manually'  would  be too  time  consuming to
           practical.  AMDPSCAN  scans  many   control  blocks  and  que
           printing error messages and leading the  PSCE to the cause of
           problem.

0         Before  AMDPSCAN can  be  used,   the verb  SCAN  must  be add
      AMDPRDMP's control table, AMDPRECT.  This is done as follows:-
0     1)  Obtain a superzap dump of AMDPRECT (normally in LINKLIB)  2)
      the next available unused entry.
         An empty entry looks like this.....
0        40404040 40404040 00000000 40404040 40404040
0     3) Apply the following superzap.
0        name amdprect
         VER  XXXX  40404040 40404040 00000000 40404040 40404040

0        To use the feature  in csect 'AMDPSLOP' to force the  printing
      'next' 5000 instructions to be executed  in a 'STANDALONE' dump,
      locate the 'NO-OP'  at offset X'D12' in  'AMDPSLOP' and change it
      'UNCONDITIONAL BRANCH'.
         Should the  location of  this 'NO-OP'  change due  to maintenan
      'AMDPSLOP',   the  'NO-OP'  can  be  easily  located  in  a  'DUMP

      13.3.5   Validity Checking
+     13.3.5   Validity Checking
+              ________ ________
-         Validity  checking  is   performed  by   a  common   sub-routi
      AMDPSCAN.    Addresses are  checked for   correct  boundary alignm
      word, double-word, 4K or 64K.
          Addresses are also checked  to see if they are in  the right a
      virtual storage.   Storage is split up into 6 areas - PSA, NUCLEUS
      Private  Area, CSA,  LPA  and SQA.    In  addition,   for some  va
      checking, the Private Area is further divided into LSQA and PVTUSE
          Addresses are  checked using 'negative   logic'.  If an  addre
      for example,  a UCB should be in the NUCLEUS,  a check is made to
      the address is in  the PSA, the Private Area, CSA,  LPA  or SQA.
      is,  then an error is recognised.  In  this way if the boundaries
      example,  the  NUCLEUS,  can not  be determined at  initialization
      address validation can still be performed although restricted.
          Note:- The PSA is not considered to be part of the NUCLEUS.
0         The boundaries of 8 areas are determined as follows:-
0     PSA
           PSA is from location 0 to location X'FFF' NUCLEUS
           The NUCLEUS  starts at  location X'1000'. Top  of the  NUCLEU
           determined from  the CVT  field CVTNUCB.  If this  is invalid
           inaccessable, the start of the Private  Area is used as the e
           of the NUCLEUS.  Private Area
               Start of  the Private Area is  determined from the  GDA f
           PASTRT. If  this is invalid or  inaccessable then the  addres
           the top of the NUCLEUS is used instead.
               The  top of  the Private  Area  is calculated  by adding
           address  of the  start  of  the Private  Area  to  the GDA  f
           PASIZE.  CSA
               GDA field  CSAPQEP points to the  PQE for CSA. The  PQERG
           the PQE is  used for the start  of CSA, and this  plus PQESIZ
           the top of CSA.  LPA
               LPA in this  context is the area  between the top of  CSA
           the bottom of SQA.  SQA
               The address  of the start of  SQA is taken from  the DQEB
           field in the  last DQE chained to  the SPQE for SQA.  The SPQ
           found from the GDA field SQAPQEP.  LSQA
              LSQA is  mapped from DQEs  for LSQA  chained from the  LDA
           each address space.  PVTUSER
              PVTUSER is that part of the Private Area that is not LSQA.

                ORE's
0         Details are printed  of the holder of each resource  and any w
      for these resources.  The resources are   printed in order of impo
      to the system at the time of the   dump.  If a waitor also holds a
      resource details of that resource  are printed.   From this relati
      of  resource holders/waitors   it should  be possible   to identif
      'critical' system resource at the time of the dump.
0      Example 1
                a) I/O outstanding on a device for which the
                   communications task is waiting.
                b) Most jobs in the system waiting for WQE buffer
                   resource which is held by communications task.
0         It can  be seen   that this is  probably an I/O   problem and
      comm's task error.
0      Example 2
                a) Most TCB/SSRB's dispatched in ASID 1 are
                   waiting for the local lock.
                b) LOCAL lock holder is in a 'page-wait', and
                   also holds the CMS lock.
                c) Page supervisor is waiting for I/O to
                   complete on a paging device.
                d) Other address spaces are waiting for

0         It can  be seen   that this is  probably an I/O   problem and
      locking problem as it might first appear from the dump.
0         A check is  made for an interlock  condition between holders/w
      of resources. Details are printed if an interlock is detected.
0      Example:

+     13.3.6.11   CPU Status Analysis
0     This  function  is  performed  by  CSECT  AMDPSLOP.   Unlike  all
      AMDPSCAN  CSECTs,  AMDPSLOP  reads the   dump  dataset directly  w
      using AMDPRDMP.
       The CPU status records are read from   the dump dataset.  If the
      the store status  has the wait bit  off,  and the status  is valid
      instruction stream pointed  to by the psw   is simulated.  If a  l
      detected an instruction trace is printed.
       A message is   printed indicating whether the   CPU is enabled/di
      waiting/ executing or looping.
       The  dataset described  by   the SYSUT3  DD  card is  used   as a
      'paging' dataset during instruction simulation.

          If AMDPSCAN produces   many messages indicating that   address
      invalid,  when they appear to be correct,  check that the fields u
      establish the boundaries  of the storage  areas are  valid.  See s
      on 'Validity Checking' for definition of these fields.
0         While  AMDPSCAN   does   function  with   SYS1.DUMPs  as    we
      stand-alone dumps,  the output may be misleading in some cases.  T
      because control block  chains may have been modified while  the du
      being taken. This is particularly so for I/O control blocks.

      14.2.2   How to Enter Info/Mgmt
+     14.2.2   How to Enter Info/Mgmt
+              ___ __ _____ _________
0        Info/Mgmt can be entered thru the AOST ISPF system using the IB
      on the AOST ISPF master application menu.   Info/Mgmt is option 8
      IBM menu.
0        Upon getting to the Info/Mgmt panel you will be prompted to ent
      name of the stored response chain (SRC)  library to be used.   Thi
      library of canned Info/Mgmt functions which  are similiar in funct
      TSO clists.
0        There are currently two(2) specialized SRC libraries:
0        1.  AMVS.INFO.BLGSRC for 205/620
0        2.  JES3.INFO.BLGSRC for 205/630
0        The SRC's that have been created for  the AMVS and JES3 librari
      designed  to simplify  problem assignment,   problem creation,   p
      transfer, problem close.  These SRC's are individualized for each
      in the group.
0        There is also a standard SRC library supported by the Service C
      group.  It's dataset name is $ASERV.INFO.BLGSRC, which is the defa
      the panel.
0        Included in the standard SRC library are several SRC's to do st
      processing.  These SRC's are:
0        1.  REPORTER
0            a) This SRC  will open a  problem and  prompt you for  all
                quired fields.
0        2.  TRANSFER or XFER
0            a) This SRC will transfer a problem to another individual.
0        After updating the SRC library name,  depress enter and the Inf
      index menu  will be displayed.    This menu is  useless for most
      uses.

      14.2.3   Basic Functions
+     14.2.3   Basic Functions
+              _____ _________
0        Some of the basic functions which are commonly used are:
0        1.  SRC Execution.
0            a) At most  panels within Info/Mgmt you  can enter EX  and
                ceive a panel prompting you with a list of available SRC
                You can execute and SRC by entering the SRC number found
                the left of the description.  SRC's are available for op
                ing a problem,  transfering a problem,  generating a rep
                of problems and closing a problem.   See the discussion
                low on how to generate your own SRC should you desire on
0        2.  Problem Display
0            a) To display an existing problem enter from the Info/Mgmt
                dex menu:
0               DI R xxxx
0               This command will Display Record  xxxx,   where xxxx is
                problem record number.
0        3.  Update a Problem
0            a) To update an existing problem  enter from the Info/Mgmt
                dex menu:
0               U R xxxx
0               This command will  Update Record xxxx,   where  xxxx is
                problem record number.
0            b) The Problem Entry panel will  now be displayed.   From h
                you can change the Status(2),  Supplemental(6)  or Text(
                The other options are not really of interest.
0            c) Status Update
0               i)    You can change  or update the programmer  assigned
                      the problem,  the person responsible for tracking
                      problem, the problem status, the priority,  plus m
                      other items.
0               ii)   Problem Status should be XFER when you change the

                i)    This panel should be used when  you have a PTF,  A
                      or support  center problem number.    If a  vendor
                      working on the problem then  the vendor status sho
                      be updated  and any other  field which  would prov
                      information to  either the vendor or  another syst
                      programmer to work on the problem.
0               ii)   When IBM determines that a  problem is a new probl
                      they will assign an APAR number to the problem.
                      APAR number you  get should be added  to the infor
                      tion in this panel.
0            e) Text Update
0               i)    The Text Entry consists of 4 parts.  Only 3 are me
                      ingful for our purposes.
0               ii)   Description.   This  part should  consist of  the
                      scription of the problem with  as much information
                      is  available.   Including  any  dump dataset  nam
                      symptoms,  product level (PUT, PTF, APAR,  etc),
                      any contacts if needed to test/assist in problem r
                      olution.
0               iii)  Status.   This  part should  be updated  whenever
                      status of  the problem changes.   For  example,  w
                      level 2  calls,  when more information  is request
                      when a test is run, when a fix is supplied, etc.
0               iv)   Resolution.  This part should be updated when the
                      nal solution to the problem has been received, tes
                      and applied.
0            f) After updating the problem record you  must file it so t
                the data base record is updated.    This is done via opt
                FILE(9) on the Problem Entry panel.
0        4.  Opening a Problem
0            a) There are three ways to open a problem.
0               i)    First,  you can have an SRC to do the basics for y
                      See the below on how to build your own SRC's.
0               ii)   Second, if you use the standard SRC library,  you
                      enter EX REPORTER.   This SRC will prompt you for
                      required information.
0               iii)  Third,  and more complicated,  you can do the foll
                      ing:
                      a)  From the Info/Mgmt Primary Options Menu enter
                      b)  Then enter 1 to open a problem.

                      c)   Enter  all required  information on  the Prob
                      Reporter Panel.
                      d)  If you wish to assign the problem to another p
                      son enter EX and
                          select number to execute the XFER SRC.  Then f

      of open discussion as everyone arrives.  This is followed by lunch
      ter lunch  there is  a 1/2  hour or  more of  local 'business'.
      'business' is a time where experiences are shared, problems are ai
      a warning to others and requests for suggestions on how to resolve
      lems are made.   After the local business there is a break followe
      1 hour presentation  by IBM,  another vendor or an  installation a
      product or  experience.   In the past  there have been  presentati
      DF/EF, MVS/XA, MVS/SP 1.3, PMO, VAM/SPF, 3081, etc.
