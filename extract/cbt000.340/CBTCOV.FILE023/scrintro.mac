                                     ABSTRACT
-             The University of Waterloo version  of SCRIPT is a power-
           ful text formatting program.  SCRIPT is very easy to use for
           "simple" documents such as memos and small papers; with just
           a few SCRIPT commands (called "control words"), you can sat-
           isfy the formatting requirements of most documents.
0             SCRIPT is  also extremely useful  for the  preparation of
           large documents such as manuals, theses,  and other research
           and instructional publications.   By using some of the "pro-
           gramming language" capabilities of SCRIPT, it is possible to
           make SCRIPT generate a table of contents and an index, or to
           write your own  control words.   This makes  SCRIPT particu-
           larly useful for  the construction and maintenance  of large
           documents, where you wish to be able to standardize the lay-
           out and make significant changes to a component of the docu-
           ment (add a  chapter,  delete a chapter,   or re-order large
           sections of text)   without affecting the rest  of the docu-
           ment.
0             To use SCRIPT,  you must use  a text editor to create the
           input file.  There are a number of text editors available to
           you:   WITS, WYLBUR,  the VM/370 CMS Editor,  or CMS WYLBUR.
           If you are not familiar with any of these editors, introduc-
           tory documentation may be obtained  from any of the Consult-
           ing Offices, and reference manuals are available through the
           Computer Reference Room.
0             In all systems,  it is possible to direct the output to a
           high-speed  line printer.    This is  usually desirable  for
           "proofreading" copies;  it  is also often desirable  for the
           "final copy" of a large document.  It is possible for you to
           request that the document be  printed on white paper.   Spe-
           cial mylar printer ribbons may  be purchased which result in
           a very high-quality printout  acceptable for reproduction by
           photo-offset printing;  or, if original copies are required,
           a heavy-bond paper is also  available.   Information on pur-
           chasing and using mylar ribbons  and/or special paper can be
           obtained by contacting the I/O Services Office (MC 1070, ex-
           tension 2686).

              Under CMS,  the  formatted document may be  typed at your
           terminal,  stopping at the bottom of  each page for the next
           sheet of paper.
0             This "Introduction  to SCRIPT"  is intended  to introduce

           you to  SCRIPT,  and therefore will  not discuss all  of the
           features of SCRIPT.   Most of  the SCRIPT control words dis-
           cussed in  this Introduction  have additional  capabilities;
           they are  described herein  in the  ways in  which they  are
           likely to be used most often.

                                 1.  INTRODUCTION
0             SCRIPT is a computer program  which accepts input,  proc-
+                                                         _____   ____
           esses it, and produces output.
+          _____                  ______
0             SCRIPT  recognizes only  two  different  types of  input:
           text and control  words.   The processing which  SCRIPT per-
+          ____     _______  _____
           forms is  called text formatting.    The output  produced by
+                           ____ __________
           SCRIPT is a document in which all  of the text has been for-
           matted according to the layout instructions specified by the
           control words.
-
-                             2.  CREATING THE INPUT
0             The input to  SCRIPT is a collection of  text and control
           words which you type at a typewriter terminal or visual-dis-
+                                    __________ ________    __________
           play terminal by  using a text editor.   A text  editor is a
+          ____ ________             ____ ______
           computer program which allows you to enter, correct, delete,
           add, and save the text and control words.
0             When you are entering the input, it is important that you
           start each sentence of the text  on a new input line.   This
           makes subsequent  insertions or deletions of  sentences much
           easier to perform.
-
           2.1   CONTROL WORDS AND TEXT
+                _______ _____ ___ ____
0             Each time  SCRIPT reads an input  line,  it looks  at the
           character in column 1.   If that character is a ".",  SCRIPT
           considers the input to be  a control word.   Otherwise,  the
           input line is treated as text.
0             Each SCRIPT control word is of the form
0               .xx operand(s)
0          The "." is  called the control word  indicator literal,  and
+                                                         _______
           "xx" is  a 2-character control  word.   Some  SCRIPT control
           words have one or more  operands.   The first operand begins
+                                  ________
           in the second position after the control word;  each operand
           is separated by a blank.

           2.2   PUTTING MORE THAN ONE CONTROL WORD ON THE SAME

                      INPUT LINE
+                     _____ ____
0             This may be  done by separating each control  word with a
           semicolon (;).   SCRIPT refers to  the semicolon as the con-
           trol word separator.  You can also put text on this same in-
+                    _________
           put line.   In general,  then,  an input line which contains
           control words is entered as follows:
0               .xx operands;.yy operands;.zz operands;text
0          where "xx", "yy",  and "zz" are control words (with or with-
           out operands).   You  cannot put SCRIPT control  words after
           the text on an input line.
-
-                           3.  THE FORMATTING PROCESS
0             The basic step in the text formatting process is the cre-
           ation of an output line.
-
           3.1   THE LINE LENGTH
+                ___ ____ ______
0             The SCRIPT ".ll"  LINE LENGTH control word  specifies the
           number of character positions in the output line.   The line
           length for  this Introduction was  defined with  the control
           word
0               .ll 60
0          The operand can be an absolute numeric value, as above, or a
           signed numeric, such as
0               .ll +20
0          which adds 20 to the current LINE LENGTH value.  If no oper-
           and is  specified,  the  default of  sixty will  be assumed.
           Normally, you will specify the value for ".ll" at the begin-
           ning of the document and then not change it.
-
           3.2   SINGLE- AND DOUBLE-SPACING
+                _______ ___ ______________
0             By default,  SCRIPT single-spaces the output lines.   The
           SCRIPT ".ds" DOUBLE SPACING control  word will cause a blank
           line to be generated between each output line.   You can get
           SCRIPT to revert to single-spacing by issuing the ".ss" SIN-
           GLE SPACING control word.

           3.3   STARTING A NEW PARAGRAPH
+                ________ _ ___ _________
0             The easiest way to define the start of a new paragraph is
           to use the SCRIPT ".pp"  PARAGRAPH START control word.   For
           example,
0               .pp;This is the start of a new paragraph ...
0          produces:
0             This is the start of a new paragraph.   The ".pp" control
           word skips a line and indents the line of text 3 spaces.

           3.4   UNDERSCORING AND CAPITALIZING
+                ____________ ___ ____________
0             The SCRIPT ".us" UNDERSCORE control word, ".up" UPPERCASE
           control word,   and ".uc" UNDERSCORE AND  CAPITALIZE control
           word allow you to underscore and/or capitalize a single line
           of text.  They are of the form
0               .us line of text to be underscored
                .up line of text to be capitalized
                .uc line of text to be underscored (and capitalized)
0          and produce the following effects:
0               line of text to be underscored
+               ____ __ ____ __ __ ___________
                LINE OF TEXT TO BE CAPITALIZED
                LINE OF TEXT TO BE UNDERSCORED (AND CAPITALIZED)
+               ____ __ ____ __ __ ___________  ___ ___________
0             With ".us" and ".uc",  it  is possible to underscore only
           selected parts of the line.    This requires that the SCRIPT
           ".ud" UNDERSCORE DEFINITION control word be used to define a
           special "escape"  character which will indicate  that under-
           scoring is to be turned off and on again.  For example, if
0               .ud set ×
0          has already been specified, then
0               .us line ×of text ×to be ×under×scored
                .uc line ×of text ×to be ×under×scored and capitalized
0          will produce
0               line of text to be underscored
+               ____         __ __      ______
                LINE OF TEXT TO BE UNDERSCORED AND CAPITALIZED
+               ____         __ __      ______ ___ ___________
0             By default, these control words will underscore all char-
           acters except those  shown in Table 1.   If you  want to add
           any of these characters to the  list to be underscored auto-

           matically,  you can use the "on"  operand of ".ud" to do it.
           For example,  if  you want SCRIPT to  include parentheses in
           the list of characters which will be underscored if they ap-
           pear in the operand string of  a ".uc" or ".us",  then spec-

           3.5   KEEPING A BLOCK OF TEXT TOGETHER ON THE SAME PAGE
+                _______ _ _____ __ ____ ________ __ ___ ____ ____
0             In many instances, it is necessary to ensure that a block
           of text not be split across  a page boundary -- for example,
           the text (or spaces) for charts, figures, or tables.   There
           are two  methods which may be  used to prevent  output lines
           from being split over two pages.
0             The SCRIPT  ".cp" CONDITIONAL  PAGE control  word can  be
           used to start a new page if  there is not enough room on the
           current page.  For example, when SCRIPT encounters the input
           sequence
0                                     - 4 -
1
-
                .cp begin
                input text and other SCRIPT control words
                .cp end
0          it formats the  "input text and other  SCRIPT control words"
           in an internal  "work area" so that it knows  how many lines
           of output this input sequence has created.   If there is not
           sufficient room for these output  lines on the current page,
           SCRIPT leaves the rest of the current page blank, and prints
           these already-formatted output lines at  the top of the next
           page.
0             If you know  precisely how many output  lines are needed,
           it is  more efficient to use  ".cp" with a  numeric operand.
           For example,
0               .cp 10
0          will start a new page if there are less than 10 lines avail-
           able on the current page.
0             The ".cp" control word,  as  mentioned above,  will cause
           the remainder of the current page to  be left blank if a new
           page must be started.  This is often highly undesirable.  If
           you use the SCRIPT ".fk" FLOATING KEEP control word
0               .fk begin
                input text and other SCRIPT control words
                .fk end
0          SCRIPT will format the "input  text and other SCRIPT control
           words" internally,  and print the  resulting output lines on
           the current page if there is room for them.  If there is in-
           sufficient room,  SCRIPT will save  them for printing on the
           next page,  and  will fill the current page  with the output
           created  by the  text  and control  words  which follow  the
           FLOATING KEEP begin/end sequence.

+                ________ _ ___ ____
0             You can force the output to start  on a new page by using
           the SCRIPT ".pa" PAGE control word.
0               .pa
                .pa +5
                .pa 1
0          The first  example skips to the  top of the next  page;  you
           might wish to do this,  for example,  to cause a new chapter
           to start on a new page.  The second example skips to the top
           of the next page and adds five to the page number.  This may

           be useful if you intend to insert five pages which are to be
           produced in some other fashion.   The third example skips to
           the top of the next page and resets the page number to "1".

           3.7   BLANK LINES (SPACES)
+                _____ _____  ______
0             The SCRIPT ".sp" SPACE control  word creates blank output
           lines.   The operand specifies the number of blank lines de-
           sired.
0               .sp 5
                .sp
0          The first example produces five blank lines,  the second ex-
           ample the default of one.  If double-spacing were in effect,
           the first example would produce 10  blank lines and the sec-
           ond would produce 2.  If you want to leave a specific number
           of blank lines  independent of whether you  may decide later
           on to switch the document from single- to double-spacing (or
           vice versa), then use the "absolute" operand, as in
0               .sp 5 a
0          In this  form,  ".sp" will  produce the specified  number of
           "absolute"  blank lines,   independent  of the  line-spacing
           mode.

           3.8   BLANK LINES AT THE TOP OF A PAGE
+                _____ _____ __ ___ ___ __ _ ____
0             By default,  SCRIPT prevents the  printing of blank lines
           at the top of a page.   If  you want to allow this,  use the

           ".le" LEADING SPACES control word.   For example,  you might
           begin each new chapter with the input sequence
0               .pa;.le yes;.sp 5 a;.le no
0          The ".le yes" allows the printing  of blank lines at the top
           of the page, and the ".le no" suppresses them again.

+                ________ _____ _____
0             By default,  SCRIPT does not print pages which are empty.
           You can  use the  SCRIPT ".em" EMPTY  PAGES control  word to
           force SCRIPT to print empty pages.  For example,

           3.10   BREAKS
+                 ______
0             A "break" in the output text is a place where the current
           output line has been printed,  no matter how full it may be,
           and a new output line begun.    There are four ways in which
           you can specify or cause a "break" in the output text to oc-
           cur.  The first way is to use the SCRIPT control word BREAK,
0               .br
0             The second way is to use a SCRIPT control word which,  in
           addition to doing other things,   also implies a break (such
+                                                 _______
           as the ".sp" control word).
0             The third way is to start an  input line with one or more
           blanks.  This starts a new output line, indented by the num-
           ber of blanks with which the input line starts.
0             The fourth way is to start an input line with a tab char-
           acter.  This starts a new output line, indented to the first
           defined tab stop.

0          4.1   DEFINING TAB-STOP POSITIONS
+                ________ ________ _________
0             SCRIPT does not know about any physical tab-stop settings
           you may have on your output device.   Instead,  you must use
           the SCRIPT ".tb" TAB control word to define the positions in
           the output line  which are to be used  as tab-stop settings.
           By default,  tab-stop  settings are defined in  positions 5,
           10, 15, 20, ..., 80, as in
0               .tb 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80
0          When SCRIPT encounters  a tab character while  putting words
           onto the output line, it inserts the number of blanks neces-
           sary to move  over to the right so that  the character after
           the TAB will  appear in the next tab position  in the output
           line.
0             For example,  with the default tab-stop positions,  a TAB
           in the first column of an input  line will create a new out-
           put line in which the first 4 positions are blank.

           4.2   ENTERING TAB CHARACTERS IN THE INPUT
+                ________ ___ __________ __ ___ _____
0             If your input device has a TAB key, you can use it to en-
           ter the TAB character simply by depressing the TAB key.   If
           your input device does not have a TAB key, then you can make
           use of the SCRIPT ".tb set" TAB SET control word to define a
           special character which will be treated as the TAB character
           whenever it is encountered in  the input.   For example,  if
           you were to include the control word
0               .tb set $
0          at the beginning of your input  file,  you would be defining
           the "$" to be the "TAB" character -- any time SCRIPT encoun-
           ters an "$" in an input  line,  it will automatically insert
           the number of blanks necessary to  move over to the next de-
           fined tab-stop position.

           4.3   TABS WITH A "FILL STRING"
+                ____ ____ _  ____ ______
0             In addition to  inserting blanks as it moves  over to the
           next tab-stop position, SCRIPT also provides the ability for
           you to specify a "fill string"  (one or more non-blank char-
           acters) to be used instead of blanks.   For example,  if you
           had defined a tab-stop position with
0               .tb '. '50
0          then the input sequence
0               .tb set $
                .sp
                hello $ there
                .br
                how are $ you
0          would produce
0          hello . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . there

           4.4   RIGHT-ALIGNING TABS
+                ______________ ____
0             SCRIPT also gives  you the ability to  specify a tab-stop
           position to which text will be right-aligned.   For example,
           if you had defined the above tab-stop position as
0               .tb '. '60r
0          then the exact same input sequence would produce

           how are . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  you
0          The TAB between the words  "hello" and "there" causes SCRIPT
           to "push" the word "there" over  to the right until its last
           character is in column 60.

           4.5   CENTERING TABS
+                _________ ____
0             If the tab-stop  position is followed by  the letter "C",
           such as
0               .tb 30c
0          then SCRIPT will align the text following the TAB so that it
           is centered at that position.  For example,
0               .tb set ^;.tb 30c
                the value is^123456789
                .br
                and the next is^123
0          will cause the  number "123456789" to print so  that the "5"
           is in column 30, as shown below.
0          the value is             123456789

0          then SCRIPT  will align  the text following  the TAB  to the
           first occurrence of that character.  For example,
0               .tb set ^;.tb 30'.'
                the value is^12.456789

0          5.1   THE LEFT AND RIGHT MARGINS
+                ___ ____ ___ _____ _______
0             The SCRIPT ".ad"  ADJUST control word may be  used to de-
           fine the starting  position of the output  line with respect
           to the  physical left  margin (the  physical left  margin of
           this Introduction is actually 10 spaces  to the left of this
           paragraph).   The term "physical left  margin" refers to the
           leftmost possible print position of  the output device (ter-
           minal or printer).  The term "left margin" by itself is used
           in this  Introduction to refer  to the starting  position of
           the output line on the output device,  as defined by the AD-
           JUST value.   Since  the initial ADJUST value  is zero,  the
           left margin and the physical left margin are therefore iden-
           tical at the start of SCRIPT processing.   Specifying a non-
           zero ADJUST value moves the left margin the specified number
           of spaces  to the right of  the physical left  margin.   The
           length of the output line,  as defined by ".ll",  is not af-
           fected by the ADJUST value.
0             For example,   this document contains the  SCRIPT control
           words
0               .ad 10;.ll 60
0          at the beginning of the input  file;  this creates an output
           line which begins  in print position 10+1 and  ends in print
           position 10+60.  This ADJUST value was specified in order to
           allow a sufficient margin on the  left of the page for bind-
           ing.
0             The right margin is one position to the right of the pos-
           ition defined by the sum of  the ADJUST and LINE LENGTH val-
           ues.

0             The SCRIPT ".tm"  TOP MARGIN control word may  be used to
           define the  number of lines  to be left  at the top  of each

           ated with the control word

0             The text area is that area  of the output page bounded on
           the  left by  the  left margin  (as  defined  by the  ADJUST
           value),  on the right by the right margin (as defined by the
           sum of the ADJUST and LINE LENGTH values plus 1), on the top
           by the top margin (as defined by the TOP MARGIN value),  and
           on the bottom by the bottom margin (as defined by the BOTTOM
           MARGIN value).
0             It is this "text area" into  which SCRIPT places its out-
           put lines.   Whenever the text area becomes full, SCRIPT au-
           tomatically skips to a new page.

0             The criterion which  SCRIPT uses in attempting  to "fill"
           the output line  is called the "formatting  mode".   To show
           the effects of the various formatting modes, the text in the
           following sections  has been formatted  by the  same control
           words which the text is describing.

0             To begin, we will start with "unformatted mode", by issu-
           ing the SCRIPT control word
0               .fo no
0             In the "unformatted mode", SCRIPT does no "text

           We are now in "unformatted mode".
           This is useful when we want to enter the text for a table or
           figure or example, and we
           want the output to appear exactly as we entered it.
0             In "unformatted" mode,
           ".ll" has no effect on the length of the output line.

0               .co
0          then SCRIPT puts as many words as possible on an output
           line.  Note that, although no output line is longer than the
           ".ll" value, the right margin is still "ragged".  We can get
           even more text onto each output line if we also add
           "hyphenation" to the "concatenation" process.

           6.3   HYPHENATION
+                ___________
0             SCRIPT has three modes of hyphenation.  The hyphenation
           mode is specified with the HYPHENATE control word:
0               .hy off
                .hy user
                .hy on
0             The "off" operand causes SCRIPT to perform no
           hyphenation.
0             The hyphenation mode specified by the "user" operand is
           the default hyphenating mode.  If SCRIPT encounters a
           hyphenated word and it cannot get the whole word on the
           current output line but can get the first part and the
+                                  ___
           hyphen, it will do so, and put the rest of the word on the
           next output line.
0             The "on" operand causes SCRIPT to perform automatic hy-
           phenation.  SCRIPT attempts to detect all permissible hy-
           phenation points in a word*, and then puts as much of the
           word as possible on the current line, followed by a hyphen.
           The rest of the hyphenated word is used to start the next
           output line.
0             SCRIPT's hyphenation attempts do not always result in a
           hyphenation point which is aesthetically pleasing.  Unfortu-
           nately, the human's rules for deciding which hyphenation
           points "don't look right" are not sufficiently well-defined
           to be programmed.  To overcome this, there is an "exception
           dictionary" which you may choose to imbed (using the SCRIPT
           ".im" control word) if you are formatting your document with
           ".hy on", by specifying

            adapted from the IBM "HYPHENATION/360" computer program.

           tains several thousand "exception" words.  When hyphenation
           is "on", SCRIPT first checks a word it wants to hyphenate to
           see if it is in the exception dictionary.  If it is, SCRIPT
           considers only the hyphenation points defined for that word
           in the exception dictionary (which may, of course, be none).

           Introduction to discuss them here; you can learn more about

+                __________________________  _________  ____
0             In the "concatenated-and-justified" mode, SCRIPT adds an-
           other step beyond that of concatenation -- after it realizes
           that it cannot get any more on the output line, it then in-
           serts extra blanks between words.  We can add justification

+                _________ ______ __ ____
0             The output  line normally starts  at the left  margin (as
           defined by the ADJUST value).  To indent output lines a spe-
           cific number of spaces,  use the SCRIPT ".in" INDENT control
           word.   This indentation will remain in effect until another
           ".in" control word is  encountered.   Consider the following
           examples:
0               .in 10
0                    This causes  all output lines  to be  indented ten
                     spaces from the left margin.  The control word
0               .in +5
0                         adds five  to the  current INDENT  value,  so
                          that output lines are  now indented 15 spaces
                          from the left margin.  The control word
0               .in
0          used without an operand causes the  INDENT value to be reset
           to zero, so that the output lines now begin at the left mar-
           gin again.
0             Note that the INDENT control word, when used in the above
           ways,  does not  alter the positioning of  the right margin.
           If that is desired, the control word may be used in the form

0             To offset all output lines after the next one is printed,
           use the SCRIPT ".of" OFFSET  control word.   The ".of" value
           is relative to the current  ".in" INDENT value,  and remains
           in effect  until the  next ".of"  or ".in"  control word  is
           used.   A list of points could  be formatted by using OFFSET
           as follows.
0               .of 4
                (1) first text input line for point

                     ing the ".oo".   The "output overlay" patterns are
                     printed in the order in which they are defined.
0             The ".oo"  control word  can be  used to  create marginal
           notes in indented text, as shown below.

                The following lines of text will be indented 10 spaces
                and the ".oo" OUTPUT OVERLAY control word will
                be used to position the word "here"
                .oo 1 here==>
                on the line in which the word appears.
                Note that ".oo" does not create a break in the
                formatting of the text.
0          produces:

0             Many  documents require  the  use  of footnotes.    Using
           SCRIPT, it is possible to enter the text of the footnote im-
           mediately  after the  word  to  which the  footnote  refers.
           SCRIPT  formats the  footnote text  into  an internal  "work
           area",  counts the number of output lines which result,  and
           leaves sufficient room at the bottom of the text area to en-
           sure that the footnote text is  printed at the bottom of the
           same* page.   For example,  the text for the footnote at the
           bottom of this page was created by the following sequence of
           text and control words:
0               at the bottom of the same*
                .fn begin

                footnote may spill onto the next page or
                for the line containing the reference to get
                pushed over.

              The SCRIPT  ".fn begin" FOOTNOTE  BEGIN control  word de-
           fines the start of the footnote.   The output resulting from
           the input text and SCRIPT  control words thereafter is saved
           in SCRIPT's  internal "work  area".   The  SCRIPT ".fn  end"
           FOOTNOTE END control word  terminates this "internal format-
           ting" of the  footnote and restores the  formatting mode and
           the values of control words such as ".in" and ".of" to what-
           ever their  values were before  the ".fn begin"  was encoun-
           tered.
0             By default,  SCRIPT separates the  last line of text from

           a line with  a centered row of dashes,   followed by another
           blank line.   You can change this by using the "set" operand
           of the ".fn" control word.  For example, the following input
           sequence
0               .fn set 4

0          sets the  number of  "footnote separator"  lines to  4,  the
           first of which contains 20 left-justified dashes.   The 2nd,
           3rd, and 4th separator lines will be entirely blank.   What-
           ever you  place between the first  and second slash  will be
           left-justified on that separator  line.   Whatever you place
           between the second and third slash will be centered.   What-
           ever you  place between the third  and fourth slash  will be
           right-justified.

0             The text you read in  newspapers and magazines is format-
           ted in multiple columns per page.  A number of journals also
           use this style, and some of them require that authors submit
           camera-ready  copy which  is already  formatted in  multiple
           columns (some IEEE publications,  for example).   SCRIPT can
           produce output in up to nine columns on a page.

           10.1   DEFINING THE PAGE LAYOUT
+                 ________ ___ ____ ______
0             To use  this multiple-column facility,  you  must specify
           the following:
0             1.  the ".cl"  COLUMN LENGTH control word,   to define
                  the number of characters to be placed on each line
                  in a column,
0             2.  the ".cd" COLUMN DEFINITION  control word,  to de-
                  fine the  number of  columns on  the page  and the
                  displacement of each relative  to the left margin,
                  and
0             3.  the ".ll" LINE LENGTH control word,  to define the
                  total number of character positions on the result-
                  ing multiple-column output line.
0             As an example,  imagine that you wish to format output in
           two 60-character columns per page, with a 10-character "gut-
           ter" between them,  resulting in a  total line length of 130
           characters.   This  can be  achieved by  the SCRIPT  control
           words
0               .cl 60;.cd 2 0 70;.ll 130

           which   define   two  60-character   columns   starting   at
           displacements 0 and 70 on the 130-character line.  The first
           column occupies positions 1 through 60,  the gutter occupies
           positions 61 through 70, and the second column occupies pos-
           ition 71 through 130.

           10.2   STARTING A NEW COLUMN
+                 ________ _ ___ ______
0             Working in multiple-column mode requires  a change in the
           approach taken to formatting a document.   As in single-col-
           umn mode,  the  ".pa" PAGE EJECT and  ".cp" CONDITIONAL PAGE
           control words operate on a page basis.   However,  there are
+                                     ____
           also ".cb" COLUMN BEGIN and ".cc" CONDITIONAL COLUMN control
           words which operate  on a column basis,  and  you should use
+                                    ______
           them instead of  ".pa" and ".cp" (unless you  really want to
           start a new page).   In  multiple-column mode,  text defined
           with a ".fk" FLOATING KEEP sequence  will be promoted to the
           next column if it won't fit in the current column, and foot-
           notes  are printed  at  the bottoms  of  columns instead  of
           pages.
-
           10.3   BALANCING COLUMNS
+                 _________ _______
0             By default, SCRIPT attempts to "balance" the columns on a
           page before it prints the page.   For example,  if the first
           column on a page  is full and the second is  only half full,
           then SCRIPT  will move  some lines  from the  bottom of  the
           first column to the top of the second column,  to create two
           columns which are each three-quarters full, before it prints
           the page.
0             You can use the ".bc"  BALANCE COLUMNS control word (with
           an ON or OFF operand)  to explicitly prevent (OFF)  or allow
           (ON) column-balancing.
0             There are some things which  prevent SCRIPT from attempt-
           ing to balance  the columns on a page  even when column-bal-
           ancing is "ON".   For example,  if a column contains a foot-
           note or was terminated with a ".cb" COLUMN BEGIN,  then that
           column cannot be balanced.

           you can  use the  ".cd" con-    columns  (by   using  either
           trol word instead.   For ex-    ".sc" or ".cd"),  SCRIPT at-
           ample,  you can  go from two    tempts  to  balance  columns
           columns to three columns and    before switching to  the new
           back to two columns again.      column mode.

                      11.  USING SYSTEM REFERENCE VARIABLES
0             System Reference  Variables are  maintained by  SCRIPT to
           make it possible to get at information that may be useful in
           formatting a document.   For example,   the SCRIPT ".ur" USE
           REFERENCE control word
0               .ur &sysdate
0          results in the characters
0               October 8, 1985
0          which is the date on which this document was printed.   This
           is extremely useful in preparing letters,  because it can be
           used in conjunction with ".ra" (RIGHT ADJUST), as in
0               .ur .ra &sysdate
0          to produce the following effect:
0                                                       October 8, 1985

0             A MACRO is a "named" sequence of SCRIPT control words and
           text  delimited  with  ".dm"  DEFINE  MACRO  control  words.
           SCRIPT saves  these input lines  and invokes  them automati-
           cally whenever  the name of  the MACRO  is used as  a SCRIPT
           control word.  For example,
0               .dm para begin
                .sp a;.il +8
                .dm para end

0          and,  as a result,  one blank line will be generated and the
           next line of text will be  indented 8 positions to the right
           of the current indent value.

+                 ________ ___ _______ ____ _________
0             There will be instances in which it is necessary to force
           SCRIPT to treat an input line  as text even though it starts
           with the  control word indicator  (.)  mentioned on  page 1.
           This can be done for a specific number of input lines by us-
           ing the SCRIPT ".li" LITERAL control word.  For example,
0               .li 2
                ... This line of text starts with a "."
                ... and so does this one
0          causes SCRIPT  to take the next  2 input lines as  text even
           though they start with the control word indicator.

           13.2   CHANGING THE CONTROL WORD INDICATOR
+                 ________ ___ _______ ____ _________
0             If you  have a  large number  of input  text lines  which
           start with the control word indicator, and you don't want to
           have to bother  counting them and specifying  the ".li" con-
           trol word  as shown in the  previous section,  then  you can
           change the control  word indicator to some  other character.
           For example,
0               .li ?
                .These are lines of text which may or may not
                start with "."s, but will be treated as text anyway
                .       ...
                .       ...
                ?li .
0          causes SCRIPT  to change the  control word indicator  from a
           "." to a "?", and then back to a "." later on.

           13.3   DEFINING A "NO-BREAK" CONTROL WORD INDICATOR
+                 ________ _  ________  _______ ____ _________
0             Many of the SCRIPT control words described in this Intro-
           duction cause a "break" (see Section 3.10).   There are some
           instances in which this is not desirable.   You can define a
           "no-break" control word indicator by using the ".li" control
           word.  For example,
0               .li , nobreak
0          defines the  "," as the  "no-break" control  word indicator.
           This is very useful whenever you  want to use a control word
           which would normally create a break without having it do so,
           as shown below:
0               The following lines of text will be formatted without
                creating any breaks, and, at the same time, we will
                indent the text 10 spaces, starting with the line
                in which the word "here"
                ,in 10
                appears.  If ".in" were used instead, the line
                containing this word would be printed, no matter
                how full it was, and the indent would start with
                the next line after it.
                .in
0          produces:
0          The following lines of text will be formatted without creat-
           ing any breaks,  and,  at the same time,  we will indent the
           text 10  spaces,  starting with the  line in which  the word
                     "here" appears.   If ".in" were used instead,  the
                     line containing  this word  would be  printed,  no
                     matter how full it was, and the indent would start
                     with the next line after it.

           separator character, the SCRIPT ".cw" CONTROL WORD SEPARATOR
           control word will do it for you.  For example,
0               .cw <
0          causes the control word  separator character (the semicolon,
           ";") to be replaced by the character "<"; you can restore it
           to the semicolon later on by specifying

           14.5   SOME VERY HELPFUL SCRIPT OPTIONS
+                 ____ ____ _______ ______ _______
0             There are a  great many options you can  specify when in-
           voking SCRIPT, but most of them are beyond the scope of this
           Introduction.   The "MARK" and "NUM" options below will make
           it considerably easier for you to relate the output produced
           by SCRIPT to the corresponding lines in your input file, and
           hence make it easier for you to edit your input file.
0          EIGHT     SCRIPT assumes  that the output is  being produced
                     at SIX lines to the vertical  inch on a page which
                     is 11  inches long.   Specifying the  EIGHT option
                     causes SCRIPT to count lines at eight per inch in-
                     stead of  six to decide  when the 11-inch  page is
                     "full".
0          MARK      The "MARK" option causes  SCRIPT to underscore the
                     first character  of each  input text  line in  the
                     output.  This makes it easier to determine exactly
                     which input line you are  looking at,  in conjunc-
                     tion with the "NUM=" option.
0          NUM=n     The "NUM=" option causes SCRIPT to print the input
                     line numbers and  the name of the  input file from
                     which they  came,  starting in output  column "n".

-
                     For example,  "NUM=85" is  convenient,  because it
                     puts this information off to the right of the text
                     area.   Take care  that the value you  specify for
                     "nn" is  greater than  the sum  of the  ADJUST and
                     LINE LENGTH values for your document.
0          PA=m:n    Causes SCRIPT to print only pages "m" through "n".
                     If ":n" is omitted, only pages from "m" to the end
                     of the document are printed.
0          PL=n      If your output is not being produced on paper that
                     is 11 inches  long,  you will need  to tell SCRIPT
                     how many lines there are  on the page.   For exam-
                     ple, if your output page is 12.5 inches long, then
                     specify  "PL=75" for  6  lines  to the  inch,   or
                     "PL=100" for 8 lines to the inch.
0          PR        These options are  only useful in CMS,   where the
           DISK      output is sent to your terminal by default (in all
           SCREen    other systems  mentioned above,  output  is always
                     sent to  the high-speed line printer).    The "PR"
                     option causes  SCRIPT to send the  output directly
                     to  the high-speed  printer.    The "DISK"  option
                     causes SCRIPT to put the output on your disk, in a
                     file with  the same name  as the input  file,  but
                     with a file type of LISTING.   The "SCREen" option
                     is useful for visual-display  devices which do not
                     support "backspace and underscore" output.
0          STOP      If your  output is being  produced at  a hard-copy
                     terminal, this option will cause SCRIPT to stop at
                     the bottom of each page so that you can put in the
                     next sheet of paper.

0             Before you embark  on using SCRIPT for a  document of any
           great complexity, it is recommended that you try SCRIPT on a
           few small documents, to build up some experience.
0             If you  need help with SCRIPT,   contact one of  the User
           Services Consultants, in any of the Consulting Offices.

+                 ______
0             SYSPUB is a set of MACROs which simplify the task of pre-
           paring and formatting documents which fall into the category
           of papers, theses, books, and other research publications.
0             SYSPUB allows you to prepare your publication using a set
           of commands which perform all  of the numbering of chapters,
           sections, subsections, tables, figures,  and footnotes auto-
           matically.   These commands also format  the text to conform
           to  a widely-accepted  set  of  layout standards  (including
           those required for theses at this university).   SYSPUB will
           also generate a Table of Contents for your publication.
0             SYSPUB allows  you to prepare  your document  without you
           having to learn  any more about SCRIPT than  is presented in
           this Introduction (in fact, with SYSPUB, you don't need most
           of what is in this Introduction, but it's a good idea to un-
           derstand it anyway).   This  Introduction was prepared using
           the SYSPUB commands.
0             A copy of  the SYSPUB User's Guide many  be obtained from

           15.4   UPDATING YOUR SCRIPT REFERENCE MANUAL
+                 ________ ____ ______ _________ ______
0             SCRIPT is under on-going development at the University of
           Waterloo.   Updates to  your SCRIPT Reference Manual  may be
           produced by submitting the following job:
0               //jobname JOB '#,T=1,P=200,F=5200'
                //     EXEC     SCRIPTMN,SCRIPT='+UPDATE=yymmdd'

           where "yymmdd" is replaced by the  date on which your SCRIPT
           Reference  Manual was  printed (see  the title  page in  the
           SCRIPT Reference Manual).    Each time you submit  this job,
           you obtain a new title page,  and replacement pages for your
           Reference Manual  for any component  which has  been changed
           since the date specified by "yymmdd".
0             You can  submit either  of the  above jobs  through WITS,
           WYLBUR,  or CMS.   If you are  submitting a job through CMS,
           then type "help submit" for  more information before you at-
           tempt to  submit the job.   If  you are submitting a  job on
           cards at a BATCH Service card-reader,  then you must replace
           the "#" with your account number and lock.
