*****************************************************************
*  THIS IQARIHOO MODULE IS A MODIFIED VERSION WHICH IS USED IN  *
*  SYSTEMS WHERE THE DSS FUNCTION IS REMOVED, I.E. WITH THE     *
*  FIRST RELEASE OF THE PLR (3.8). THIS MODIFIED VERSION IS     *
*  NEEDED TO ALLOW RE-INSTALLATION OF DSS.  THE MODIFICATION    *
*  CONSISTS OF RESETTING LOC. X'279' IN THE NUCLEUS TO ZERO,    *
*  THEN RETURN WITH A BR14.                                     *
*                                                               *
