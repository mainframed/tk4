*FUNCTION -
*              THE DEVICE INPUT/OUTPUT MODULE PROVIDES THE DEVICE
*              DEPENDENT VARIABLE INFORMATION NEEDED BY THE BTAM
*              READ/WRITE ROUTINE TO PREPARE THE TELE-PROCESSING
*              CHANNEL PROGRAMS.
         SPACE 2
*              EACH OF THE FIRST 32 BYTES CONTAINS AN OFFSET TO THE
*              CHANNEL COMMAND WORD OFFSETS FOR EACH TYPE OF I/O
*              OPERATION.
         SPACE 2
*              FOLLOWING THE CCW OFFSETS ARE ALL OF THE DIFFERENT
*              CCW'S THAT ARE USED BY THIS DEVICE TYPE. FOLLOWING
*              THE CCW'S ARE THE NECESSARY SPECIAL CONTROL CHARACTERS.
